 0786834501  Disney's Winnie the Pooh Music Box ||	  Good Books, Bad Music  My two year old adores Winnie the Pooh so I had to pick this up. The books are about 20 pages each. The story is written on the left side and illustrations accompany them on the right. Each page is a bit long for my daughter and she loses interest quickly. The illustrations aren't helpful since they are sparse. The stories are very cute but might be better suited to an older child with a longer attention span. It would be perfect for beginning readers. The music box isn't very musical at all. When we first opened it I was convinced it was broken. The battery is irreplacable so I was going to send it back. My husband got it to play by banging on the lid. Then we closed it. It's only played once since. My daughter still loves this carry along set despite the unmusical box. I got it for half price so I don't feel too bad but I wouldn't reccomend paying full price for this.....and don't give it as a gift. <end>
 B00005V8QE  Children's Giftware 2.88" Ladybug Music Box ||	  Misleading Item, But beautiful  Very simple. It looks just like it is in the picture - that's NOT the problem. The problem is that the song is incomplete. It goes "You are my sunshine, my only sun shine, you make me happy, when skies are grey... so don't take my sunshine away" - it's missing "You never know dear, how much I love you...." I called up and they say "It's not a mistake, that's how it's manufactured." REALLY? If I knew that, I would have NEVER purchased it. I kept it JUST for the cosmetic value. <end>  verycutegift  The Ladybug Music Box is a great product. I actually have the turtle and the bear from Reed and Barton as well and love all three of them. Good quality and good music. We received the turtle as a gift when my oldest daughter was born and enjoyed it. That led us to purchase the bear and ladybug for our additional children. <end>  Ladybug music box  Very happy with ladybug music box, especially "You are my Sunshine" music! Gave this to our 3 month old granddaughter for her baptism. Three years ago had given her sister the silver turtle music box. The 3yr. old loves them both!!! Good value, and charming keepsake gift, not only to look at, but sturdy enough for little hands to enjoy. <end>  Love this!  I absolutely love this music box. It is wellmade and the music quality is great. I had it engraved with the Christmas date and will purchase a different one each year for my daughter. Great product. <end>
 B00007FFHW  PalmBeach Jewelry 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Rolling Ring ||	  Love these rings  I really love these rings. They fit well & I love that I can wear on my thumb or on my finger! Came right on time & well worth the price! <end>  Very Nice  I love this ring! It is so hard to find this style in gold! The ring is beautiful and of good quality. <end>  Gold- plated rolling ring  Took awhile to get used to the rolled look in a ring - don't know how it will hold up since it's only gold plated. <end>  love these rings  These were exactly what I was looking for. Great for work and going out. Sometime I would even stack with other rings. Size was accurate <end>  OK  I like the ring, it's cute. I bought it to wear as a thumb ring. I've been wearing it every day since I got it (about 2 weeks) and it has already tarnished. I paid $20 for a $20 ring. <end>  Good for the price  I really like the way this ring came out - it's very true to the picture. If i had to say one negative thing about it, it would have to be that getting the ring on is a bit of a challenge! It's not quite a smooth procedure, and every time I go to put it over my finger, I feel like I'm going to grind the finish off. However, it's still holding up and it looks really good. This is a nice every day ring that goes with anything. <end>  Classy  I wanted a classy piece to wear on my right hand for work when I'm wearing Gold. I found that I will end up wearing this outside of work. Very classy looking <end>  Love it  This ring is great for the price. Most of my rings are silver, so i bought because it was inexpnesive. I love it. I have gotten so many compliments. I definity recommed buying it. <end>  nice ring  I like these type of wedding bad rings. This particular one is well worth the money. It looks nice and teh gold color is very bright. I am not sure how long the plating will last. <end>
 B00007FFZR  Black Genuine Marcasite Silvertone Metal Antique-Finish Religious Cross Pendant and Chain 18&quot; ||	  not at all like the picture  I will be returning this item. In the picture it appears that this necklace has very nice marcasite stones, but they are so tiny you can barely see them. Also, despite what the picture seems to show, there are only five stones. And the chain is just like those on gumball machine necklaces. <end>  very nice  Nice item but I was disappointed that I could not find the &quot;gift wrap&quot; section. <end>
 B00007FG0N  PalmBeach Jewelry Sterling Silver Religious Lord&apos;s Prayer Cross Pendant and Chain 18&quot; ||	  Nice item but not impressed with seller  Received the item (ordered it for Christmas but it didnt ship till 1/12). When I finally got it, one of the black sections on the cross was missing. The customer service people were no help and gave me the impression I was interrupting their social life (Called twice to get another operator). I'm sending the item back today (had to pay for shipping, no UPS return label available). Overall, dissatisfied with the seller, west palm beach jewelry. Item was nice for the price but hard to read the lords prayer (looks like its there though). <end>  Nice Religious Product.  One thing that is not advertised is the size of this product. For those of you wondering the cross is about 3/4 in. long by 1/2 in. wide. To read the Lord's Prayer you need to put your eye really close to the stone in the middle. The version of the Lord's Prayer is the commonly known one based off of the King James Version. It ends with "...but deliver us from evil. Amen." (Excludes "for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.")Overall I think a nice religious product. <end>  Lords Prayer Pendant  wife was very happy with the cross. It is larger and more decorative than the one we had looked at in Walmart. <end>  Somewhat disappointed  The reason I wanted this, so you can see the Lord's prayer in the middle, you really cant see it that well. The necklace is pretty itself, but the whole idea I chose this was so you could see the Lord's prayer, would not recomment this to anyone. <end>  Horrible  I expected so much more from this necklace. I gave it as a Christmas gift and you have to have it tilted at just the right light to read part of it and then tilt it again to read the other parts. My friend has worn it once. Very embarrased. <end>  junk item's all of them  i all ready told taht i think Lord's Prayer Sterling Silver Cross Pendant that i got was no good the chain fell apart the first time my wife put it on and you chould not see the Lord's Prayer in it i also told you that i will not be sending it back because the whole thing is not wearth it and i will never buy any thing else from you thank's for nothing.all your items are junk. <end>  Lord's Prayer Pendant  The service I received from this company was great. I received this item just in time for Mother's Day. The presentation of the box was beautiful. The pendant was a little smaller than I had expected but it was still very pretty. <end>  Lord's Prayer cross  This is a very pretty necklace. However, the prayer in the middle is a little hard to see but it is worth the price paid I like the sterling silver <end>
 B00007FQWZ  PalmBeach Jewelry 3.60 TCW Round Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Beautiful but doesn't wear well  This ring is absolutely gorgeous. My husband bought it for me for Christmas, but by the first week of January I had already lost two stones (and that was with only wearing it a couple of times). Either it's really delicate or not made very well.But nevertheless, it is a really pretty ring, and if you don't bang it around too much it should continue to look great. <end>
 B00007FRHK  PalmBeach Jewelry Round Simulated Pearl Crystal Accent Goldtone Elephant Pin ||	  Elephant Pin  I ordered this Pin for my Mom as a Mother's Day gift because she likes elephants.

 B00007GFC5  PalmBeach Jewelry Simulated Tanzanite Slide ||	  It's ok  I ordered this product for my wife. It is larger than I expected. The quality is ok. I'm not sure if I will order this type of jewelry without seeing it in person first. <end>

It looks so good and I get lots of comments on it. <end>  Perfect to complete my three piece smoky quartz set  This beautiful ring completed the set and now I have a beautiful necklace, earrings, and the ring. I have received compliments on the ring and love it. <end>  I had much trouble with the size. I have doubts that have changed in size for the first time.  I had much trouble with the size. The ring is very beautiful and is so and so it appears in the photo on the website, but I had to return twice the size. I have doubts that have changed in size for the first time since my wife will stay exactly the same as the first class. Yet I will return for a second time and tell them how I was. <end>  Would have paid $400.  I bought this ring because of all the rave reviews that seemed too good to be true. The truth is that the raves are understatements. The ring is unbelievable, not at the asking price but at 10X the amount. You have to see to believe. I can't say enough. It is exquisite! <end>

 B00007GIJD  Oval-Shaped Multi-Color Simulated Cat&apos;s Eye 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Enamel-Finish Parrot Pin ||	  Nice costume jewelry.  Adequate quality for what it is. Didn't have it long before our home was burglarized, though. They took everything! (Knuckleheads, what are they going to do with this pin?) <end>  Not the same colors as picture  Bought this as a gift. The picture shown is not exactly what I got. The bird with the green head, on the left, has a blue body. The middle bird has a red head and green body. The bird on the right has a blue head with an orange body. It was cheap, and I'm sure the person who I bought this for will still like it (she's a bird lover). It is a small pin, but I like that quality. <end>
 B00007GIQH  Pear Cut Simuluated Smoky Quartz Crystal Accent 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Cocktail Ring ||	  Far nicer than pic shows  Not shown in photo is a very beautiful romanesk setting that the stone sits on.One of the nicest pieces I've ever purchased under 10 dollars. <end>  Smokey Quartz Ring  I agree with the other poster..This is a gorgeous ring..I even put a little bleach on it, to see if it would discolor, and it didn't..A lovely piece..Palm Beach Jewelry is very nice.. <end>  large  larger than anticipated but very nice. Received lots of compliments. High quality for the money. <end>  It's a BIG ring...but beautiful  It is a very big ring that matches the earrings also sold on Amazon exactly. I got it in a size 6 and that is a little too big for my pinkie finger. I should have bought a size 5. It dwarfs my diamond rings and takes away from their beauty because it has its own beauty. I honestly would not know that it is a CZ ring unless I asked the owner. The CZ's surrounding the larger stone look fantastically real because they are the proper size for this ring and are not at all gaudy. Just be sure of your ring size before you buy the ring. <end>
 B00007GJ9W  PalmBeach Jewelry 1/3 TCW Round Genuine Emerald and Diamond Accent 10k Yellow Gold Band Ring ||	  nothing like pictured  This item is nothing like pictured. &quot;diamonds&quot; are raised bits of silvery metal. &quot;emeralds&quot; are dull, poorly cut and set. <end>
 B00007GJY0  PalmBeach Jewelry 1.54 TCW Princess-Cut Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Ring ||	  A Really Nice, Unique Ring,  When my mother's wedding ring started to break, I decided not to wear it for everyday use, and so I looked around for something that looked good, but that wouldn't cause me a moment's worry if it became lost or broken, or, Heaven forbid, stolen.I tried a few different rings before settling on this one. It doesn't have any bits that stand up, so when my daughter and I have tickling fights, she doesn't get scratched, (and for that matter neither do I), and I can wear it while cooking or cleaning without a problem. The design is gorgeous and I've gotten a lot of complements about it since I started wearing it. I like it so much that I've promised myself someday I'll have a real ring made that looks like it.I've had it about a year now - the stones are still tight in their settings, and it's survived all kinds of evil treatment because I don't ever take off my wedding ring. I don't think I could have done better for twice the money. <end>
 B00007GLG5  PalmBeach Jewelry Sterling Silver Polished Engraved and Floral Bangle Bracelets 3-Piece Set 7&quot; ||	  Quality varies from set to set, apparently  I have two sets of these bangles. I ordered the first one a while ago, and the bracelets were perfect - pretty, shiny, just the perfect width (1/8") and length (7"), with good clasps, very good quality. One is plain, smooth, polished bangle, and the other two have etched floral designs on them. I was wearing the first set of bangles for a while, then decided to purchase a second set to wear together with the first set. I don't know what happened, but it seems as if their quality went down. The new set of bracelets I purchased still looks very pretty and shiny and all of the bracelets are perfectly matched, but the clasps are just horrible. Only one of the bracelets has a good clasp, the other two - ugh. One clasp is too tight and is very hard to open, another one is too loose and keeps opening on its own. If it weren't for the security chain attached to the bangle, it would probably fall off my arm without me even noticing. Still, I kept the second set, I really like to wear both sets of bangles together, and I like how they look on my arm. I'm not even sure how to rate these, the second set would have been a perfect set of bangles and a great bargain (just like the first one), if it weren't for those clasps. I'd give my first set of these bangles 5 stars, and the second one - 2, so overall rating is 3. <end>

 B00007GN57  PalmBeach Jewelry 5.08 TCW Oval Cut Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Aurora Borealis Drop Earrings ||	  Beautiful, Flawed Product  The earrings themselves are beautiful, and they shipped right on time. The packaging was perfect, and my mother loved them for her birthday present.However, one of the earrings had a scratch across the entire front of the earring that was very obvious. I am returning them, and I hope I can get a new pair without blemishes because these earrings truly are gorgeous. (This scratch and the fact that I have to return them to get new ones is why I only gave it 4 stars)Great product--Just make sure you look closely at each earring when you receive them to ensure there are no marks or blemishes. <end>  Beautiful  They are absolutely gorgeous. They are versatile and match almost anything. Comfortable fit and came early. They are comfortable and a great quality. Arrived early. Will buy from this seller again. <end>  Best jewelry on the planet  I checked out these earrings for months before I purchased them. Boy, was I dumb to wait! These earrings exceeded my high expectations! They are absolutely gorgeous! These are my new go-to earrings & I have lots! I have never seen earrings that sparkle & shine like Lillith Star! Fantastic value for the price! I couldn't wait to order more! They were shipped quickly and in gift giving quality packaging! I will be a long time customer! <end>  Very Pretty  These are very pretty Aurora Borealis earrings. They sparkle with different colors while the usual predominate color in the center is a bright very sparkly blue depending on how the light hits it with multiple colors along the edges. These are very pretty earrings! <end>  not as good as it looks  They did not look as good as they did online. They were also supposed to be for non-pierced ears, but the clasp was extremely painful and dug into the earlobe. I bought these for my wedding and will NOT be wearing them. <end>
 B00007JKMZ  Multi-Gemstone 10k Eternity Ring ||	  Ring  I love this type of eternity band. Unfortunately, one of the stones fell out after 3 times of wearing this ring. I have several of this type of eternity band and this is the first to have a stone fall out. <end>

I originally ordered this for my girlfriend's birthday but i wasn't able to wait that long. I opened it up when it first arrived. At first i was unsatisfied since it had looked cloudy. Thinking I had failed I simply left it by the window and went to workout. Two hours later I was ready to pack it up and return it when I had actually noticed the diamonds were radiating and the corals itself make an impression on you. (I myself put it on since we have similar finger sizes) All I can say was, the reaction on her face was speechless. I was scared but then reassured as she leaped to my arms. Woohoo! oh yeah! free gift, bracelet?

 B000086G6Q  PalmBeach Jewelry Sterling Silver Cross Pendant and Chain 24&quot; ||	  awsome!  this is such a pretty knecklace i got this and it came with a really beautiful thank you gift from the company im very impressed the chain is long the way i like it and i do not regret getting this item <end>  Awesome  This is a great looking necklace for men. 6'0 185 and it looks and fits perfect. <end>  Great necklace and pendant  Im a man in early 40's and its a great necklace, wanted something shiny and thats what I got chain is good as well, very satisfied. <end>  Nice pendant, but it gets "stuck" on the chain too easily  Pros-Very nice looking cross and chain combination-Does not look "girly" like some necklaces do - very well suited to be worn by a man-Materials appear to be good for the price; not a cheap looking neclaceCons-The cross gets stuck on the chain too easily. When moving throughout the day, most pendants have the ability to slide freely as the chain shifts positions. What I have noticed after a few weeks of wearing this is that this pendant/chain combination does not do that and I find myself having to re-adjust it several times throughout the day because it has either gotten stuck or tangled. Either the chain is too thick for this pendant or the clasp connecting the pendant to the chain needs to be bigger. I'm hoping it is the latter since this seems like it would be an easy fix.-I would have preferred a shorter chain, say 22" or 20". The chain that it comes with is 24" and is a little bit too long for my tasteOverall, I am not thrilled with this item but I can't say that I am disappointed either - hence the 3 star rating. Could be better but it also could be a lot worse. <end>  Good Quality  The pendant is the perfect size for anyone. The chain is pretty nice too but it gets twisted so you have straighten it out every few days but I'm not disappointed with the purchase. <end>  perfect size and simple look  I wanted a simple, understated looking cross and this one was perfect for me. Not too big, not gaudy. I would recommend this one to anyone who wants a classy, smaller size cross to wear. <end>  awesome  was always a fan of this item. I tell everyone I know about it so that they will buy it too! <end>  Perfect!  I read many reviews about this product before purchasing. I read it was cheap and not actually sterling silver. All of these reviews are false! It has sterling silver engraved on the back of the cross as well as it came with a sticker wrapped around the chain saying the same thing. It is very good quality. My husband has worn it every day since receiving it. It looks awesome on a guy. It is not too big or too small and can look dressy or casual. Perfect! <end>  Very, very nice, but....  I gave it 5 stars because it is so nice. My only problem with it was that it was too large for me. But, if you pay attention to the size when considering it, an it's the size you like, then you will not be disappointed with it. By the way, I sent it back and was promptly refunded the purchase price. <end>  Ok product, you get what you pay for  This product came a lot bigger then I thought and felt/ looked cheaper quality. I did contact the seller about returning it and you needed all of the paperwork and to write down return numbers and they made it kind of a hassle. The day before i was sending it back my dog ended up eating the return forms. O well... <end>
 B000086IC0  PalmBeach Jewelry Diamond Accent 10k Elephant Pendant ||	  Definitely not what I expected  The product that I received (Elephant pendant) was far too small(and cheesy) to justify even half of the price that I paid. I had to go to a store and purchase a second pendant for my girlfriend so that she would not be disappointed. I would NEVER purchase anything from this merchant again. <end>

 B00009PTZ6  Leaf Earrings ||	  Beautiful earrings but disappointed in delivery  These are beautiful earrings, but I was really disappointed when they came in the plain white box on top of a cotton bed. I mean, really, when you buy fine jewelry you expect it to come in a box with some sort of display cardboard or something that will make it look attractive when opening. I bought these as a gift for someone for Christmas, and I feel bad that it will seem like I got them at a discount store. Really, how much can it cost for them to at least put them in an earring type box that make them look like they are the fine jewelry they are supposed to be? They came connected together sitting on a bed of cotton. How disappointing! All it would take is a piece of cardboard with holes strategically placed so that they are displayed prettily when opened. <end>

 B0000AOX25  Sterling Silver and Garnet Heart Earrings ||	  Perfect for Valentines Day  My husband got me these earrings as a Valentines Day present. I love them! The garnets are beautiful! I would recomend wearing some kind of stopper on the backs though, they tend to come off if you don't. I almost lost mine the first night I got them. Overall I would say, deffinately worth buying! Looks lovely with casual or dressy attire. <end>  Ecstatic Granddaughter  I gave these earrings to my soon-to-be 9 year old granddaughter for valentine's day. She absolutely loved them. It was hard to get her to wear anything else for weeks. <end>  My girlfriend loved them  She is a big fan of red, and she said that she really liked these earrings when she got them. I was somewhat afraid since I have no sense of style or fashion when it comes to women, so i was happy she enjoyed them. I would recommend them since they were relatively inexpensive and she liked them alot. <end>  Very Nice  I bought these earrings for my daughter for her birthday. The Garnet is very pretty and shows up well. These were a great value for the money and my daughter wears them often. <end>  Pretty!!!  I was pleasantly surprised - my first on-line jewelry purchase. These are very pretty and elegantly packaged. <end>  specifications  Would like to know the size of these earrings....Such as length.. Thank you. <end>
 B0000AOX2G  Sterling Silver Mother of Pearl Earrings ||	  Nice for the price  They did have the backings with them by the way  -) These were nice pretty earrings for the price, the only thing I didn't like was on the back of the earrings where the mother of pearl is, you could see a little glue. <end>  Where are the backs to these earrings?  I'm not ordering anything that has missing parts! <end>
 B0000AOX2W  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Bangle Bracelet ||	  Beautiful Bracelet-I Love it  These are so pretty,I bought all three pieces. The bracelet, necklace and earrings. They are just beautiful. Nice quality silver and black onyx. The bracelet closes with a latch that is very easy to do. I have a hard time with your typical closures on most bracelets. I'm hoping some day I can find the ring that matches. <end>
 B0000AOX3G  Sterling Silver, Blue Topaz and Peridot Multi-Inlay Stone Bracelet ||	  What a great bracelet -- better than the photo!  This bracelet is so well-made and attractive! There's pretty-and-witty visual interplay in the textures, colors, and shapes of the faceted transparent gems, the polished, opaque semi-precious stones, and the silver links and bezel settings. I love this bracelet, and I'll probably wear it more than any other. I have it on now with jeans and a sweater, and I could wear it as well witha suit, or to a beach party, or almost anywhere. It would look good with almost anything. It has a nice weight, too. Someone should take another photo of it, though! It looks way better than the photo posted when I bought it -- I was really worried about it until it came, and then I was so happy-happy! <end>
 B0000AOXKK  Freshwater Cultured Pearl 7.0-7.5mm Pendant on 14k Yellow Gold Chain, 18" ||	  Great pearl -- not so great chain.  I thought the pearl was a very good size and quality for the price. I was very happy with this purchase, though I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the gold chain. I think it's much too thin for such a large pendant and I'm worried it's going to break very easily. <end>  Surprising good buy!  I actually bought this planning on only using the chain. I broke one of my necklaces and needed a rather thin chain, and this was cheaper than just getting the chain alone. I figured for this price, no way the pearl was going to be any good. I was wrong. It's no mikimoto, but the one I received was a good looking pearl. Well worth the money. <end>  Nice  The pearl is a very nice size and has pretty good luster. I can see my face in it. The chain, while thin and dainty, goes well with it; just don't wear it to bed or put it in a pile with other necklaces! It'll definitely get tangled up. <end>  Lovely - excellent value for the money  I was quite thrilled with this. Because I live in Bermuda, it actually cost me around $35.00 after shipping and duty, but even at this price I consider it to be an excellent deal. I ended up purchasing one for a friend too. <end>  It was a good buy  I purchased this recently after reading the previous review by the other customer. I agree that the chain is fine for the pendant...but if you like me purchased the item mainly for the pearl (as I have other chains that I can -and have- tried it on) then there is no problem. I have saved the chain to use with other smaller pendants that I have and used the pendant with a slightly thicker chain. It is slightly bigger than I visualised (a miscalculation on my part) but still looks ideal with the pair of earrings I wanted to match it with. Overall a good buy..pearl acceptable quality. No problems so far. <end>
 B0000AOXL2  Freshwater Cultured Pearl 5.5-6.0mm 14k Yellow Gold Necklace, 20" ||	  Great value  I bought these for my wife and she has been wearing them almost everyday for two years. They still look great and are very strong. <end>  Better than expected  I bought these pearls for my wife as a gift for our first Christmas together. They were a hit. She had never owned pearls before and she loves them. They look great with everything. <end>
 B0000APUE7  Freshwater Cultured Pearl Bracelet w/ Pink Leather Strap, 7" ||	  very pretty  if you are a small woman such as myself you will love this bracelet. very delicate and feminine. i just love it. goes perfect with all my gold jewelry too. <end>  NOTHING LIKE PICTURE  I THOUGHT THEY HAD SENT ME THE WRONG BRACELET-THE LEATHER WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR AND TEXTURE FROM ONLINE PICTURE AND THE PEARLS ARE SOOOO SMALL-THE WHOLE THING LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE FOR A 6 YR. OLD.I'M SO DISSAPOINTED.IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. <end>
 B0000AS4O9  14k Yellow and White Gold Italian 1.6mm Twisted Snake Anklet, 9" ||	  Very nice Anklet  Received this the other day, used a promotional certificate so total cost was about $40 versus the $60 sale price, which was good deal. It is very dainty but pretty. The size is just right for the ankle at 9.5" so there is extra room versus the 9" anklets which can be tight on medium size anklets. The mix of white and yellow gold gives it a nice effect. Have not worn as this will be for the summer, but think this is a different style for your anklet and can be mixed with white and yellow gold accessories. Definitely recommended it for a different look. <end>
 B0000AS4QS  14k Yellow Gold 2.5mm Diamond-Cut Rope Bracelet, 7" ||	  Very delicate  I was surprised, and a little concerned, when I saw how fine and delicate this bracelet is. My wife, however, was delighted; and THAT is the true measure of the item as it was a gift for her. <end>  Pretty and Durable  It's really pretty and still durable enough to wear every day. In fact, I never take mine off, and have never had problems with it. The texture is interesting and captures attention. <end>  very pretty  this bracelet was purchsed for myself. I thought it was very pretty for its size- i am using it as a charm bracelet, as i recently lost one, and wanted a replacement. i am enjoying it very much, as it is very delicate on my wrist. thx you Amazon for showing it on-line. Flora in Florida <end>
 B0000AS4SC  14k White Gold 3mm Diamond-Cut Rope Bracelet, 7" ||	  White Gold Bracelet  I love this bracelet for its "wear-ability". It goes well with work or play clothes and is heavy enough to stand up to some abuse. I recommend this to anyone looking for a pretty, general purpose bracelet. <end>
 B0000AS4SQ  14k White Gold 3mm Diamond-Cut Rope Necklace, 24" ||	  Horrible!  The moment I opened the box and saw this thing I made the decision to return it. It looks liked tarnished, cheap metal; very dull, lackluster. The box it came in is more impressive than this scrap of metal. Steer clear of this one! <end>
 B0000AS4VB  14k White Gold 1mm Round Snake Chain Necklace, 18" ||	  Great choice  I needed a medium length chain to use with several different silver pendants. This chain is attractive and strong and has worked out perfectly. <end>  Gloomy  This is a very well made chain and it is well weighted. However, it has no shine to it whatsoever!! It looks very grey like gloomy storm clouds. It doesn't even look like white gold it is so dull. Looks more like stainless steel in overall appearance/color. I sent mine back! <end>
 B0000AS4XP  14k Yellow Gold 1mm Italian Round Wheat Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  Not very good quality.  I was very disappointed in the quality of this chain...basically it doesn't look at all like real gold, it looks totally fake! I returned it since I expected something better, only to then find out that the gift certificate I used on the order was not valid any more and could not be used for another purchase. And had to pay for the shipping back too! So definitely won't be buying jewelry again. <end>  Beautiful Chain  I love this chain - it's a lovely color of gold and solidly made. While it's not really thick enough to wear by itself, it's absolutely perfect for pendants and has a sturdy clasp so you don't have to worry about losing it. I bought it for my 3-stone diamond pendant and it looks terrific. <end>  Disagree  All you have to do is check the gram weight to see that this will not be a heavy chain. For the money it is a good buy and is a good chain to hang pendants on if the 18" is too short. If you want big and bold then this isn't it-but if you want a chain to change off lengths on different pendants you own this is the one for you. Lobster claws alone are $30.00 bucks. <end>  beautifully crafted chain  A beautifully crafted piece of wheat gold and a very good value. <end>  Cheap!!  I agree with the first review. Looks like kid's jewelry. Don't waste your money. <end>
 B0000AS4XQ  14k Yellow Gold 1mm Italian Round Wheat Chain Necklace, 24" ||	  good quality, rich matte gold color  No complaints about the quality. What I like best is that the wheat link has a rich gold color that is not too shiny, whereas something like a box link is much shinier. <end>
 B0000AS4XV  14k Yellow Gold 1.5mm Italian Round Wheat Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  UNACCEPTABLE  I had an extremely difficult time trying to close the clasp. Just too small, practically impossible. I refuse to spend 5 or more minutes trying to put this necklace on. <end>
 B0000AS4YF  14k Yellow Gold 4.6mm Italian Figaro Bracelet, 8" ||	  Figaro Bracelet  I brought this bracelet and was pleased on how comfortable it wears,half the time I don't realize that I have it on! Also my friends want to know where I got this from so they might purchase there's. So if you are lookin' for a bracelet I think this would be for you!! <end>
 B0000AS4YH  Men's 14k Yellow Gold 4.6mm Italian Figaro Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  Great Chain  I am very pleased with this chain. Amazon's description is completely accurate. The gold chain is very well made and durable. The gold chain has a good mass (it is NOT thin or flimsy) and the chain reflects light well. I highly recommend it if you seeking a quality Italian gold chain in this size. <end>  14k Yellow Gold 4.6mm Italian Figaro (fig-a-row)  Excellent piece of jewelry, and weighed in at 15.7 grams, greater weight than advertised. I have a 3.5 gram cross on it, and it's perfect. Nice weight and color is a true 14K yellow gold. It matches my other solid 14k gold pieces. <end>  verrrrrrrry nice  QUITE A BIT HEAVIER THAN YOUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT STORE CHAIN , THIS ONE IS THE REAL DEAL !! I'M WAITING FOR THE PRICE OF GOLD TO HEAD BACK DOWN AGAIN TO GET THE MATCHING BRACELET !! <end>  gold necklace  Men's 14k Yellow Gold 4.6mm Italian Figaro Chain Necklace, 20"I really like this chain, I was suprised that you sold these chains. Its great quality and I weighed it and it was right on the spot, like it was advertised. Thank you for selling the 14k at a great price, I've looked everywhere and yours is the best! I will be back, thank you, D.H. <end>  Not from Italy, Poor Quality  This necklace was not Italian as indicated. It did not come in a wooden gift box. It was lighter in weight than listed. It did not have a smooth and polished surface. It was generally poor quality. I returned it immediately but have yet to receive my refund two weeks later. <end>
 B0000AS4YL  14k Yellow Gold 6mm Italian Figaro Bracelet, 8" ||	  VERY SOLID AND BEAUTIFUL  I owned this bracelet for 20 years until my house was robbed Christmas Eve. I LOVED this bracelet. I had over 25 charms added to it which my my children gave me over those years. It is heavy, sturdy and solid. The Figaro in my opinion is the best if you work your hand hard. The lobster claw clasp is the best. Never a problem there. I never had a link break! The charms are irreplaceable, but the bracelet I am definitely buying again and starting over. I wore it everyday and it got hit, pulled, tugged, you name it and it never broke and kept its beautiful shine. As with all jewelry it did need to get cleaned every now and then. And I always got complements, not only for the charms, but because of the style of bracelet I chose. It is a winner whether to wear alone or like me, add charms. <end>  Figaro  This bracelet has appeal also the appearence that tells others that the figaro style maybe what you're in search of! So if considerin' a bracelet that isn't too big but very noticable you might want this!! <end>
 B0000AS507  14k Yellow Gold 2.9mm Square Italian Byzantine Bracelet, 8" ||	  Byzantine Beauty  If you're in search of a bracelet to catch others eyes then I tell you this is the one! This beauty has a way of creating conversation and the appeal that many others may want to own. Also the wear and weight is very pleasin'!! <end>  Easy to wear and good weight for the $  I had a similar bracelet stolen from my luggage, so I hoped this would be of similar quality. I was pleasantly surprised. The $ per-gram value is excellent, and the bracelet is acceptably hefty. It doesn't pull the little hairs on your arm like some do. It's flexible and easy to wear even with a watch or other bracelet. <end>
 B0000AS51A  Men's 14k White Gold 3mm Italian Link Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  14k White Gold 3mm Italian Link Chain Necklace, 20"  This was the first time I've ordered jewelry off Amazon.com, and I was really impressed by the quality of the chain. I chose this necklace as a gift for my boyfriend, after about 3 months of looking at different chains--online and in stores. The chain stood out because I have not seen this style anywhere else--it's unique. I like it because it's not plain, but it's also not fancy to the point of girlie-ness. To my taste, it's just right. The photos don't do it justice; it's beautiful, and my boyfriend seems to be very happy with it. I was a little nervous about buying a necklace I hadn't physically seen and touched, but the expectations I had about the quality, appeal, and value were definitely exceeded. <end>  awesome chain  I wanted something new looking, and this was it. It's great! The only thing is I would like the 22" too. It looks great on. Everyone who sees it likes it also. Great weight and solid chain. <end>
 B0000AS51D  14k Yellow Gold 4mm Italian Superflex Herringbone Chain Necklace, 18" ||	  Lovely  The necklace sits very nicely on the neck, doesnt roll over or bend, the gold is also the perfect color, not too shiny. Bought this for my mother and she enjoys it tremendously. <end>  Excellent Value  I purchased this necklace for my girlfriend for her birthday. It shipped on time and was excellently packaged. The necklace itself is quite fine however you should be aware that it scratches fairly easily (being 14k and all). Other than that an excellent necklace and will purchase again. <end>  Absolutely fabulous  This is truly stunning.You feel like a million bucks when you put it on.And then you'll wonder how you lived so long without it.It's classy and comfortable, and new-Lexus shiny.The clasp is a bit smaller than I expected,but it seems secure and I'm a happy customer. <end>  Nice Necklace  I bought this necklace for my wife for Christmas and she was very pleased with it. <end>

 B0000AWPHI  18k Yellow Gold 8mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 5 ||	  heavy solid gold band  This is a classic - heavy, shiny, true to size. A pleasure to wear every day. <end>  Sweet! UPDATED  I am getting married in a month and had purchased a "square" ring from another site, which I liked, but just did not look all that square to me (I had seen an awesome, very square, chunky design in the form of a cheap ring at Aldo that I was trying to replicate in some way, even though the ring I ended up with was much subtler).So this "square" ring, at first and even second blush, looked rather...round. Plus, it was a 14k ring, which looked too "silvery" to me, as my skin tone is flattered by Autmn-style colors, needing a richer gold color.So, I decided I'd go where the competition was and go to a round ring. If I couldn't get my square edges, at least it would be chunky and a good deal.I had tried round rings, even comfort fits, on at jewelry stores. They were thin and feminine looking. Clearly they were trying to skimp on the materials, and often they were 14k. I noticed the prices were significant at places like Helzberg, being $400 plus, often $500 or more for a "substantial" ring, a price I was unable to pay.In any event, I decided I would try this ring.Something to note is that once you go from size 10 to 10.5, they add an "extra" 1mm to the ring. So, it goes from 8mm to 9mm. Of course, you are paying additional for the additional metal, but it does make the ring a little more substantial top to bottom once you hit 10.5. I am an 11 so I ended up with a "9mm" ring in my basket.I received the ring today and it's a beauty! HEAVY! Wow, my hand has a whole new heft to it, it feels like. This is MUCH MUCH heavier than the thin 14k squared ring I was sent as above. This ring is pretty hefty. Most anyone would be proud of it.On the inside it's stamped with the obligatory "18k" but also a little infinity symbol, which I thought was a little "spiritual" touch to what is most likely a wedding band for the majority of buyers.The ring sits higher above the finger, so it has a profile and height. It is not like a thin little band that hugs your skin. On me, those looked positively feminine. I hated them and that is why I ran from round rings and wanted a more masculine square one.It slips on easily, is very comfortable to wear and slips off with a reasonable amount of wiggling and cajoling. In other words, perfect. True to size, yet even more comfortable than other rings I've tried. The comfort fit interior is very "pillowy" and smooth. Nice.The heft of this ring makes this a great compromise for me, and the PRICE is FANTASTIC!! Feels like one of those $500 gold rings for much less. THANK YOU, AMAZON!UPDATE Oh man, heaviness is a blessing and a curse. I have now gotten married and have worn this ring for a month now. I sort of wish I'd have gotten a lighter band. I still feel this thing weighing down my finger, i.e. the sensation hasn't "deadened" for me. Not a nightmare, not necessarily annoying, but just a little distracting point.Also, since this ring is comfort fit and "puffs out" (is rounded outwards) a little both on the inside and outside (it's not like a straight "pipe segment"), I feel it on the first bone of my middle and pinky fingers when my fingers are together. A little annoying.Of course, I really wish there were no such thing as wedding bands to begin with, I've never really cared for rings! Why not a bracelet or tatoo?! (Half-joking here, and I digress...)Anyhow, this is a beautiful band. It will start off mirror-finish and will scuff up. Mine is now pretty scratched, both micro scratches and also rock-climbing on our honeymoon put larger, fuzzier scuffs on the ring. This can be refinished at any good jeweler, but I prefer the duller look. I don't like shiny-shiny. That felt too feminine.At this point, I obviously have to keep this-very-ring because it was "at the ceremony," and yes, I am very proud of it, but if I could do it all over again I'd scrap the comfort fit bulgy-ness and get a lighter, flatter 14k gold ring, purely for comfort issues. 18k gold is heavy!Remember, you will be wearing this the rest of your life. <end>
 B0000AWPIE  18k Yellow Gold 8mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 5.5 ||	  heavy solid gold band  This is a classic - heavy, shiny, true to size. A pleasure to wear every day. <end>  Sweet! UPDATED  I am getting married in a month and had purchased a "square" ring from another site, which I liked, but just did not look all that square to me (I had seen an awesome, very square, chunky design in the form of a cheap ring at Aldo that I was trying to replicate in some way, even though the ring I ended up with was much subtler).So this "square" ring, at first and even second blush, looked rather...round. Plus, it was a 14k ring, which looked too "silvery" to me, as my skin tone is flattered by Autmn-style colors, needing a richer gold color.So, I decided I'd go where the competition was and go to a round ring. If I couldn't get my square edges, at least it would be chunky and a good deal.I had tried round rings, even comfort fits, on at jewelry stores. They were thin and feminine looking. Clearly they were trying to skimp on the materials, and often they were 14k. I noticed the prices were significant at places like Helzberg, being $400 plus, often $500 or more for a "substantial" ring, a price I was unable to pay.In any event, I decided I would try this ring.Something to note is that once you go from size 10 to 10.5, they add an "extra" 1mm to the ring. So, it goes from 8mm to 9mm. Of course, you are paying additional for the additional metal, but it does make the ring a little more substantial top to bottom once you hit 10.5. I am an 11 so I ended up with a "9mm" ring in my basket.I received the ring today and it's a beauty! HEAVY! Wow, my hand has a whole new heft to it, it feels like. This is MUCH MUCH heavier than the thin 14k squared ring I was sent as above. This ring is pretty hefty. Most anyone would be proud of it.On the inside it's stamped with the obligatory "18k" but also a little infinity symbol, which I thought was a little "spiritual" touch to what is most likely a wedding band for the majority of buyers.The ring sits higher above the finger, so it has a profile and height. It is not like a thin little band that hugs your skin. On me, those looked positively feminine. I hated them and that is why I ran from round rings and wanted a more masculine square one.It slips on easily, is very comfortable to wear and slips off with a reasonable amount of wiggling and cajoling. In other words, perfect. True to size, yet even more comfortable than other rings I've tried. The comfort fit interior is very "pillowy" and smooth. Nice.The heft of this ring makes this a great compromise for me, and the PRICE is FANTASTIC!! Feels like one of those $500 gold rings for much less. THANK YOU, AMAZON!UPDATE Oh man, heaviness is a blessing and a curse. I have now gotten married and have worn this ring for a month now. I sort of wish I'd have gotten a lighter band. I still feel this thing weighing down my finger, i.e. the sensation hasn't "deadened" for me. Not a nightmare, not necessarily annoying, but just a little distracting point.Also, since this ring is comfort fit and "puffs out" (is rounded outwards) a little both on the inside and outside (it's not like a straight "pipe segment"), I feel it on the first bone of my middle and pinky fingers when my fingers are together.

VERY solid, feels great on the finger. I'd been shopping around for months and I can say that we would have easily paid at least $400 each at our local shops for rings of this quality. I highly recommend Amazon.com jewelry.[...]. An awesome deal all the way around!! <end>  not what it said it was  It was NOT 6mm it was very light and much thinner then the picture.

 B0000AWRNH  Platinum 4mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 8.5 ||	  Perfect ring and fit  I have to set the record straight for this product. I received the ring in perfect condition, in the correct size, and with 950 platinum stamped on the inside. Very happy with the purchase. I would suggest other customers properly check their ring sizes for comfort fit in a jewelry store, even a local Walmart will work, before ordering online at Amazon so they have no sizing problems. <end>  Okay, but not really happy  Overall, the ring is really nice. It looks great. Had no problems with delivery. Still waiting for the return to be credited to my credit card. And they did not credit me but for only half the shipping costs. Their reasoning was because I picked the wrong size, they are responsible for only half....It was their fault with the size.I'm not happy that the ring sizes do not match with what I received. A jeweler sized my finger and I ordered that size. It was two sizes too big. Because of this Amazon said that could not refund the full shipping cost since it was my mistake. (This occurred after I already received the new size, which is still too big.) I'm a 10.5, should have went for the 9 or 9.5, but I didn't want to go through the hassle. BTW, this will be my wedding band. <end>  Simple and perfect  As a simple and perfect wedding band , you cannot pass on this, however watch the size- it does run small <end>  PERFECT RING...  if your the simple type but you want luxury or luxury is you...then so is this ring...even if luxury doesn't suit you...I GUARANTEE it will LOOK GREAT ON YOU...make sure you pick the right size ring, remember, your wedding finger may be smaller than your right hand, so have it professionally measured. HAPPY SHOPPING...PERFECT BUY...!! <end>  BIG disappointment  Not only the sizes are too big according to the provided chart but the rings were all scratched up. I called Customer Service, Amazon stated that all they can do is to email the Jewelry store and the store will get back to me in 3-4 business days. Well, it has been a week and I still haven't received any email.I returned the rings and have to placed another order and put out another 1K (because we were desperate. Our wedding is the following week!) My husband went 1 size down & I went 1 size down from the original chart. We have to pay $12.00 for 1-2 day rush order.The new rings come and once again...they were all SCRATCHED up and dull looking.I am so disappointed in Amazon! You had lost a valuable customer. <end>
 B0000AWRSV  Platinum 5mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 6 ||	  Great quality  Ordered the ring on 1/23 and received it on 1/25. The quality is Platnum 950 and the fit is perfect. Retailers want $1K for this ring...Amazon put it on my finger for $503. You can't go wrong with this purchase. <end>  Excellent value for an expensive ring  I wanted a band to match my engagement band and this was the best value for the money..After looking at other sites, Amazon had the Platinum 5mm comfort fit band that I really wanted at such a great price that I took a chance. It came in two days and was exactly the ring I wanted. I know I got a great deal (maybe because I wear such a small size helped) and am very pleased with the ring. Truly for the price of platinum and getting a solid and heavy band Amazon is the way to go.Platinum 5mm Comfort Fit Plain Band <end>  Very Nice!  This ring is very beautiful! I had doubt before i ordered it, but one i saw the real thing, i was so impressed by the quality of it. Great price and perfect quality! can't ask for me. <end>

 B0000AWSIC  Platinum 4mm Comfort Fit Milgrain Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  Better than the ones at the mall  I purchased two of these rings for my wedding, the 6mm and the 4mm. Both of these rings exceeded my expectations. I had looked at dozens of rings at numerous jewelry stores in three different malls and my fiance and I had agreed that we wanted a comfort fit milgrain pattern. Past that, here are a few points 1) THESE RINGS ARE STAMPED PLAT 950  The ring description on the product page does not specify what type of platinum these rings are made of. I took a gamble and ordered them hoping they would be either 95% or at least 90% platinum (the two most common types). To my delight, these rings were both stamped &quot;PLAT 950&quot; which means they contain the highest pecentage of platinum available.2) VERY FINE MILGRAIN PATTERN  The milgrain pattern is quite fine compared to the platinum rings that we saw at the mall. Although I do not have the tools to accurately measure it, I'd say that the grain pattern on either side of the ring does not exceed 0.5mm, probably less. So on the 4mm ring, there is less than 0.5mm of milgrain on either side, and approx 3mm of plain band. It looks very refined.3) IMPRESSIVE FLUID MILGRAIN PATTERN  Platinum is apparently much harder than gold, and the milgrain pattern on many of the rings at the mall appeared etched or scored, rather than giving a smooth organic grain pattern. The rings from Amazon more closely resemble a true milgrain pattern like the kind you'd find on a gold ring. The details appear very organic, even under a 10x loop. Since I was willing to accept the inferior appearance of the rings at the mall, I was quite pleased to see the superior milgrain pattern on the Amazon rings.3) SIGNIFICALTY LESS EXPENSIVE  By purchasing these rings from amazon, I paid approx. half of what I would have paid at the mall.4) FAST DELIVERY  No single store at the mall had the rings we wanted in our sizes. So we would have had to special order them anyway, and most places were asking for a 4 week lead time. So not only were the rings cheaper at Amazon but we got them faster as well.5) SIZING WAS IDENTICAL TO MALL SIZING  My fiance and I had our ring fingers sized at at least 10 different jewelry stores and used those measurements to order our rings from amazon. The measurements were right on. The amazon comfort fit ring fit exactly the same as the comfort fit rings at the mall. Please note however, that when purchasing a &quot;comfort fit&quot; ring, you should order the smallest possible size that will fit. This is because only the middle part of a comfort fit ring will contact your skin, unlike a traditional ring where the two ends of the rings contact your finger. This is what makes these rings comfortable, and also heavier (the middle part has to be made thicker adding wieght to the ring). However this also makes the ring easier to slide off of your finger since the ends don't contact the skin on your finger and consequently the ring doesn't pinch your skin to stop the ring from sliding off. So as a rule of thumb, when ordering a comfort fit ring, get one that is 1/4 to 1/2 ring size smaller than your traditional ring size. If my descrition doesn't make sense to you, at least go to the mall and try on a traditional and a comfort fit ring of the same size. You'll see that the comfort fit slides off of your finger much more easily.In summary, all in all I was a little nervous to order jewelry without first seeing it in person, but I was quite please with the rings once I received them. <end>  Identical to Tiffany milgrain band  Bought the Tiffancy milgrain band ($1250) and this band. After determing that they were nearly identical (and both are 950 platinum), I decided to return the Tiffany ring and keep the Amazon ring.Since this is comfort fit (the middle of the inside of the band is thicker), if you were sized for a traditional fit ring, order 1/2 size smaller. <end>  This price can't be beat!  I bought the 4mm for my fiance and the 2.5mm for myself. Both rings are stamped "PLAT 950". The craftmanships is awesome, beautifully detailed milgrains. You can't beat this price! <end>  Big Bargain, Outstanding Quality  I purchased this ring as a wedding band. I did a lot of shopping both online and in stores, and found that this series of rings from Amazon.com was the best value. The ring is beautiful! The detail of the milgrain is impeccable, and to get a platinum ring at this price is pretty amazing. <end>

Since I was willing to accept the inferior appearance of the rings at the mall, I was quite pleased to see the superior milgrain pattern on the Amazon rings.3) SIGNIFICALTY LESS EXPENSIVE  By purchasing these rings from amazon, I paid approx. half of what I would have paid at the mall.4) FAST DELIVERY  No single store at the mall had the rings we wanted in our sizes. So we would have had to special order them anyway, and most places were asking for a 4 week lead time. So not only were the rings cheaper at Amazon but we got them faster as well.5) SIZING WAS IDENTICAL TO MALL SIZING  My fiance and I had our ring fingers sized at at least 10 different jewelry stores and used those measurements to order our rings from amazon. The measurements were right on. The amazon comfort fit ring fit exactly the same as the comfort fit rings at the mall. Please note however, that when purchasing a &quot;comfort fit&quot; ring, you should order the smallest possible size that will fit. This is because only the middle part of a comfort fit ring will contact your skin, unlike a traditional ring where the two ends of the rings contact your finger. This is what makes these rings comfortable, and also heavier (the middle part has to be made thicker adding wieght to the ring). However this also makes the ring easier to slide off of your finger since the ends don't contact the skin on your finger and consequently the ring doesn't pinch your skin to stop the ring from sliding off. So as a rule of thumb, when ordering a comfort fit ring, get one that is 1/4 to 1/2 ring size smaller than your traditional ring size. If my descrition doesn't make sense to you, at least go to the mall and try on a traditional and a comfort fit ring of the same size. You'll see that the comfort fit slides off of your finger much more easily.In summary, all in all I was a little nervous to order jewelry without first seeing it in person, but I was quite please with the rings once I received them. <end>  Identical to Tiffany milgrain band  Bought the Tiffancy milgrain band ($1250) and this band. After determing that they were nearly identical (and both are 950 platinum), I decided to return the Tiffany ring and keep the Amazon ring.Since this is comfort fit (the middle of the inside of the band is thicker), if you were sized for a traditional fit ring, order 1/2 size smaller. <end>  This price can't be beat!  I bought the 4mm for my fiance and the 2.5mm for myself. Both rings are stamped "PLAT 950". The craftmanships is awesome, beautifully detailed milgrains. You can't beat this price! <end>  Big Bargain, Outstanding Quality  I purchased this ring as a wedding band. I did a lot of shopping both online and in stores, and found that this series of rings from Amazon.com was the best value. The ring is beautiful! The detail of the milgrain is impeccable, and to get a platinum ring at this price is pretty amazing. <end>
 B0000AWSKU  Platinum 4mm Comfort Fit Milgrain Plain Wedding Band, Size 7 ||	  Better than the ones at the mall  I purchased two of these rings for my wedding, the 6mm and the 4mm. Both of these rings exceeded my expectations. I had looked at dozens of rings at numerous jewelry stores in three different malls and my fiance and I had agreed that we wanted a comfort fit milgrain pattern. Past that, here are a few points 1) THESE RINGS ARE STAMPED PLAT 950  The ring description on the product page does not specify what type of platinum these rings are made of. I took a gamble and ordered them hoping they would be either 95% or at least 90% platinum (the two most common types). To my delight, these rings were both stamped &quot;PLAT 950&quot; which means they contain the highest pecentage of platinum available.2) VERY FINE MILGRAIN PATTERN  The milgrain pattern is quite fine compared to the platinum rings that we saw at the mall. Although I do not have the tools to accurately measure it, I'd say that the grain pattern on either side of the ring does not exceed 0.5mm, probably less. So on the 4mm ring, there is less than 0.5mm of milgrain on either side, and approx 3mm of plain band. It looks very refined.3) IMPRESSIVE FLUID MILGRAIN PATTERN  Platinum is apparently much harder than gold, and the milgrain pattern on many of the rings at the mall appeared etched or scored, rather than giving a smooth organic grain pattern. The rings from Amazon more closely resemble a true milgrain pattern like the kind you'd find on a gold ring. The details appear very organic, even under a 10x loop.

 B0000AWT7F  Men's Platinum 6mm Comfort Fit Milgrain Plain Wedding Band, Size 9.5 ||	  You Won't Find A Better Value  This ring is so beautiful. It's very well-crafted and you get an amazing price for such a great piece of jewelry. I shopped around all over, both online and in stores and found that Amazon.com offered the greatest savings on platinum bands.One word of caution... these rings are comfort fit, so you may have to order a half-size smaller than your normal ring size. I had to return the first ring I got and go for the smaller size, and it fit perfectly! The return was very easy and completely painless.It's easy to be afraid of purchasing an item like his via the internet, but trust me, this ring is completely worth the risk. You'll find similar rings for double the price or more elsewhere, and should you order the wrong size, there's no hassle with the return whatsoever. <end>  Style, Comfort and Price  This will be a life long item which I was able to obtain at an extremely reasonable price. This ring is very stylish and of excellent craftsmanship. I highly recommend this item. The only semi-negative is that the platinum material scratches easily. Although, I just think it gives it more character. Great item! <end>  Beautiful Platinum band!  This ring is absolutely beautiful and an exceptionally great price for a 6mm Platinum ring in size 8. I went to all the retail stores and searched the internet for the best price and Amazon was by far the cheapest for a size 8. I did find another website that sold a size 8.5 which was less expensive than Amazon. I originally bought a size 8.5 from the other website, but returned it since it was too big and then decided to buy from Amazon since the size 8 was cheaper than the other website. The only difference between this ring and the ones sold at the retail stores is that the milgrain edge is thinner/smaller, but other than that it is identical to the more expensive rings sold at the retail stores. I highly recommend anyone looking for a platinum milgrain ring to buy from Amazon. <end>
 B0000AWTGJ  14k Yellow Gold 2mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 10 ||	  A very nice little ring  Bought to wear as a "guard" to an antique ring that's slightly too large, this is a good value, very nice piece of jewellery. As always with Amazon, delivery was almost immediate. Very pleased. <end>  Gold Band  It was a gold wedding band that I have been looking for for a long time. When it got here it was just what I wanted! <end>  Great thumb ring  I ordered this band as a thumb ring--it is perfect. It is thin enough that it doesn't restrict movement and is very comfortable. Perfect! <end>  simple and elegant  as pictured and described. fits well. very happy with this purchase. <end>  !!!!  Bought the ring as a Christmas present. The ex threw it back in my face.

 B0000AWTLO  14k Yellow Gold 2.5mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 5.5 ||	  Excellent buy  I bought this band to wear stacked with another band I have, sort of as an enhancer for it and it looks great. I was a little nervous about ordering jewelry online but I felt that with the excellent price and Amazon's reputation I could take that chance. This ring is equal to what you would buy in a jewelry store. It has a nice weight for the thinness and a very nice shine. Basically, what you see is what you get. It looks exactly the same as the picture. I would advise trying on a ring of the same thickness at a jewelry store to make sure this is the width you want. You will also realize what a great price Amazon has! I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>

 B0000AWU64  14k Yellow Gold 4mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 4.5 ||	  Stunning!  This ring is stunning, gorgeous. And you can't beat the price!  -) My fiancee wanted gold, I wanted white gold, obviously I "won". But he is more than satisfied with the white gold, this is a very classy-looking ring. <end>  White Gold Ring  This is a nice ring. It is simple and elegant. The price was quite reasonable, when compared to other stores that I searched. I reccomend this ring as a wedding ring for a young couple just starting out. It would be great for a college student's budget. <end>  affordable, classy ring  This ring was well worth the price. It has a lovely shine and fits true to size. It is a very light, thin ring, so it you want something heavy with a thicker consistency to the metal, this may not be for you but as I said it is well worth the price! I'm very pleased. <end>  happy  This item came in only 2 days and in perfect condition! It is a very nice ring - shiny, smooth nice weight/width! Very impressed. <end>  Nice - worth the price  I bought this to wear everyday on my pinkie. It does scratch a bit but is worth the price. <end>  Nice and simple.  We wanted very simple gold wedding bands and we got exactly what we were looking for in these rings (my husband has the 5mm version). We're big on "sentimental value" over "flash", but IMHO, the rings look more expensive than what we paid. Very good value for the money. <end>  BEAUTIFUL RING!!!! NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER  It was exactly as described. Beautiful ring, perfect fit, classy finish. I know I would have probably paid double the price or more had I attempted to purchase similar from a jewelry store <end>  Scratched up in 5 days  While this ring is very comfortable and lightweight, I've worn it less than a week and the ring is in terrible condition. Nothing I've done in the few days it's been worn should have caused so many scratches and nicks (stay-at-home mom). <end>  loved it  it is a beautiful ring. very shiny and classy. my boyfriend loves wearing it. <end>  A Decent Ring For Work  I bought this ring here at Amazon a few years back, after losing my wedding band. I was about to buy two rings to replace the one lost; one would be a nicer ring with the comfort fit and high gloss, and one would be to wear at work, where it wouldn't matter if it got dinged and scraped up.I purchased the "nice" wedding band, which looks almost identical to this one, from a friend who manages a jewelry store. It has the comfort fit (rounding of the edges) and fit perfectly. That ring cost over twice as much as I paid for this ring.This ring I purchased only a few years ago for half of what it costs today to wear as my "work" ring. I didn't want to wear a nice ring to work and get it all scraped and messed up. It was a good decision.This ring does NOT have the comfort fit so you do feel the edges and on occasion they bite a little into your finger. Also, I bought this ring using the very same measurements I got when measured for the nicer ring, and this ring feels about a half size small compared to the nicer ring.All in all, it's held up well and even though it's all scraped up, dinged and dull, it still looks pretty nice on the finger. At twice the price I paid for it, you may be able to find a better deal. But if you are looking for a good second wedding band to work in, you may want to check this one out. <end>  Wedding Band  Ordered this as a replacement wedding band for my husband's lost ring. Great quality for the price -- about $200 cheaper than I could find at local jewelers. It's sleek, shiny and thin so if that's what you are looking for in a men's band--this is the ring for you. <end>  Great Ring for a Great Price  Loved this ring a lot. It is just plain regular ring as you can see in the store, but the Amazon price beat them all. Great value for your money.I know probably you thought that the ring may easily scratched. Well, that's may be true. The thing is there is no ring with this kind of polished (shiny) can be scratch proof.Well, buy this. You won't regret your choice. <end>  Just As it Looks  This ring looks great, it is just as shiny as it looks in the picture. It was true to its size. It was the best price I could find anywhere for this style and width. <end>  WONDERFUL!!  bought as a replacement when i LOST my diamond wedding set..ugg. true to size and wonderful quality! have had it for over a year now and it has held up wonderfully... will recommend to anyone needing a ring! <end>  wedding bands  They are just great, are exactly how i was expected and delivered in time. Thank you very much. <end>  Just what I was looking for  It's a simple band, but it looks great with my engagement ring. I haven't actually been able to wear much it yet to know anything about durability (my wedding is still a month away), but I am very pleased with how it looks. I am also pleased with Amazon's service with this product. <end>

 B0000AWUGK  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 5.5 ||	  Affordable replacement wedding ring.  After losing my wedding ring this past spring I had wondered how to go about replacing it without having to take out a loan.The ring I got from Amazon fit the bill. For considerably less than I had been quoted at a regular store in our nearest city, I have a replacement that I am proud to have on my finger.The ring arrived well packed and on time. Do not hesitate if you need a budget wedding band this will not disappoint. <end>  Just what I was looking for.....  I needed a plain gold band for when I travelled to areas that my wedding set was inappropriate to wear! This band was perfect and exactly up to the standards I would expect from Amazon. <end>  B-E-A-Utifull  I for one, really love this ring. I'm glad it was able to ship way out here over seas in Japan. It's real shiny and sweet, but if you're not real carefull you tend to scratch it up pretty well. But still, it stays in a wonderful state. I just recommend you take it off before you do any kind of serious work or maintanence of course.

 B0000AWUHO  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 6.5 ||	  Affordable replacement wedding ring.  After losing my wedding ring this past spring I had wondered how to go about replacing it without having to take out a loan.The ring I got from Amazon fit the bill. For considerably less than I had been quoted at a regular store in our nearest city, I have a replacement that I am proud to have on my finger.The ring arrived well packed and on time. Do not hesitate if you need a budget wedding band this will not disappoint. <end>  Just what I was looking for.....  I needed a plain gold band for when I travelled to areas that my wedding set was inappropriate to wear! This band was perfect and exactly up to the standards I would expect from Amazon. <end>  B-E-A-Utifull  I for one, really love this ring. I'm glad it was able to ship way out here over seas in Japan. It's real shiny and sweet, but if you're not real carefull you tend to scratch it up pretty well. But still, it stays in a wonderful state. I just recommend you take it off before you do any kind of serious work or maintanence of course.

 B0000AWUXW  14k Yellow Gold 6mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 11.5 ||	  More Than Satisfied!!  I was astonished when I received this ring. The shine, the fit, the color, everything was perfect. I was a little hesitate about buying a ring off of the internet but decided to give it a try and boy am I glad. I had looked in stores and the prices for one this nice were 2 to 3 times what I paid. Even the department store type rings were more expensive and the feel of the ring on the finger was very rough compared to the nice comfortable feel of this ring. The shipping I chose was 2 day but I received it 24 hrs. after I ordered online. It is definitely worth more than 5 stars. Thanks for a beautiful ring!! <end>  Happily SURPRISED!  Was very happyily surprised to see the quality of this product.It was much smoother than the comfort band fits my husband tried on in department stores and a way better value in price. Was scared to order jewelry online but overall Amazon has not let me down so decided to take a shot at it. Was very worth it and we got more than our moneys worth. <end>  Beautiful  An absolutely gorgeous ring at a very fair price. Delivery was very timely. No complaints here! <end>  Same band different song  I highly recommend these 14k gold bands. The price was outstanding. I purchased a couple of 14k gold bands a few years ago and was left making monthly payments. But amazon makes it totally affordable. <end>  Very pleased  The band is simple but elegant. Delivery was timely (even early) and the blue velvet box it came in was a nice added touch. Unbeatable price for a bright, smooth, shiny 14k band. My husband is very choosy about jewelry and a hard to fit size 13 -- the ring was sized correctly, well crafted, and comfortable. He got several compliments the very first day he put it on. A great experience buying jewerly on-line for the 1st time. This ring is sure to satisfy. <end>  Perfect!  It is exactly what I needed. When I showed it to my fiance he smiled and said that it is perfect. <end>  Loved it!  I ordered this ring for my husband for Christmas and he loved it! I was so happy that I was able to find this band in a size 13. I had a hassle trying to find the right size and the RIGHT PRICE!

 B0000AWW8H  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 11.5 ||	  Beautiful Ring  I bought this ring for my fiance as his wedding band for our upcoming wedding. It's a beautiful ring. High quality. The milgrain detailing gives it a unique touch. I am very happy with this purchase. You won't be disappointed. <end>  Exactly as Advertised  The picture of this ring was precisely what I received. After searching on several sites for the one ring I could wear when my bridal set is too much for an occasion, I finally found this one. The quality is exceptional and the presentation was a nice display suspended high on a carpet of black velvet.If a casual but tasteful band is what you are looking for, this is it. The detailing around the edges is so elegant and the gold is so highly polished that it looks like a piece of art. <end>  14k Yellow Gold 5mm milgrain Half Round Band  I bought this for my husband as a replacement for his original wedding band that had to be cut off when he was operated on for carpal tunnel syndrome. He likes it better than his original. I would say this is good testimony after over 17 years of marriage. <end>  Wonderful value  I bought this ring for my fiance for our wedding and it is perfect. It is exactly the same ring we tried on in jewelry stores for double or triple the price. Great workmanship, lovely and shiny just like the picture. Also, I got my band (slightly thinner but otherwise the same) on a different website and they matched perfectly. We couldn't be happier with this purchase and my fiance will proudly wear this forever. <end>  great quality  this ring I bought for my fiancee as a committment to our relationship, and along with my ring both came in beautiful navy blue ring boxes and both polised to glistten like stars. I searched for about 4 months to find the right ring, and it was just as the picture described. The miligrain detailing adds an edge of uniqueness and I could not be happier with the product. Thanks to Amazon. <end>
 B0000AWWS7  14k White Gold 2mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 5.5 ||	  Gentle elegance  This ring is delicate and comfortable. It feels great on my hand and looks lovely too. <end>  Delicate, but...  This ring is very delicate in appearance and is comfortable, however, the gold is dull and somewhat bronze-like in color.I cannot wear it next to my other white gold jewelry, as it just looks drab. I also have this same band in the 2.5mm width... shinier and brighter and much prettier, without being too wide.I highly recommend the wider version. You'll be pleased with that one. <end>  This was the perfect ring for me!!!  I purchased this ring because I needed something dainty and plain to go along with my engagement ring that is a band with a princess cut main stone and other "floating diamonds". This ring worked absolutely perfectly and I am getting so many compliments! It is so comfortable and looks like it is made to go with my engagement ring. A great find (the 2 mm is hard to find!) and a great deal!!! <end>  Very good quality!  This ring looks great, my husband love it. The fact that it's only 2mm Half Round Band, gives it a very different look. We received in less than two, we were very pleased. A great quality for the unexpensive ring, you could save the rest of the money for the honeymood....as we did!! <end>  purrrfect  I bought this ring because I wanted something lightweight, small, and cheap. I wanted it lightweight so I wouldn't be distracted by it. I wanted it small because as a woman, I do plan on wearing more rings on my wedding finger with my band and engagement ring, so I would like a small band to allow the space. And I wanted cheap because I want a ring for traveling  that is not really too flashy/draws attention, that I won't be too upset losing or getting robbed of, but a ring that will still convey that I am married. This ring does it all. It came in a beautiful box within a box and I was blown away by how much it shined. If you want something like what I've listed, definitely buy this. It's a great great deal. If you want super flashy, go for something different. <end>  So little gold  A mighty small amount of gold for the money. Actually, I returned this ring. It did not match my 14 kt white gold engagement ring. Looked like a different color metal. ALSO...I found this ring in 14 kt. white gold, same mm width at a big blue box retailer & it did match my ring...and for $27.00 and change !!! Weighed exactly the same so why spend more money? <end>  Very thin  Everything was as promised, 14k white gold, sized correctly and very nice, but I had no idea how thin a 2mm width ring is. Imagine uncoiling a paperclip and shaping it around your finger - that's how thin it really is. Other than that, it's dainty, has clean lines and matches my thin engagement ring band. <end>  My wedding ring  I bought this ring as my wedding band to match the engagement ring my now husband had given me. I am very happy with the purchase. The ring itself is beautiful and exactly how amazon described it.

 B0000AWWTF  14k White Gold 2mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 6.5 ||	  Gentle elegance  This ring is delicate and comfortable. It feels great on my hand and looks lovely too. <end>  Delicate, but...  This ring is very delicate in appearance and is comfortable, however, the gold is dull and somewhat bronze-like in color.I cannot wear it next to my other white gold jewelry, as it just looks drab. I also have this same band in the 2.5mm width... shinier and brighter and much prettier, without being too wide.I highly recommend the wider version. You'll be pleased with that one. <end>  This was the perfect ring for me!!!  I purchased this ring because I needed something dainty and plain to go along with my engagement ring that is a band with a princess cut main stone and other "floating diamonds". This ring worked absolutely perfectly and I am getting so many compliments! It is so comfortable and looks like it is made to go with my engagement ring. A great find (the 2 mm is hard to find!) and a great deal!!! <end>  Very good quality!  This ring looks great, my husband love it. The fact that it's only 2mm Half Round Band, gives it a very different look. We received in less than two, we were very pleased. A great quality for the unexpensive ring, you could save the rest of the money for the honeymood....as we did!! <end>  purrrfect  I bought this ring because I wanted something lightweight, small, and cheap. I wanted it lightweight so I wouldn't be distracted by it. I wanted it small because as a woman, I do plan on wearing more rings on my wedding finger with my band and engagement ring, so I would like a small band to allow the space. And I wanted cheap because I want a ring for traveling  that is not really too flashy/draws attention, that I won't be too upset losing or getting robbed of, but a ring that will still convey that I am married. This ring does it all. It came in a beautiful box within a box and I was blown away by how much it shined. If you want something like what I've listed, definitely buy this. It's a great great deal. If you want super flashy, go for something different. <end>  So little gold  A mighty small amount of gold for the money. Actually, I returned this ring. It did not match my 14 kt white gold engagement ring. Looked like a different color metal. ALSO...I found this ring in 14 kt. white gold, same mm width at a big blue box retailer & it did match my ring...and for $27.00 and change !!! Weighed exactly the same so why spend more money? <end>  Very thin  Everything was as promised, 14k white gold, sized correctly and very nice, but I had no idea how thin a 2mm width ring is. Imagine uncoiling a paperclip and shaping it around your finger - that's how thin it really is. Other than that, it's dainty, has clean lines and matches my thin engagement ring band. <end>  My wedding ring  I bought this ring as my wedding band to match the engagement ring my now husband had given me. I am very happy with the purchase. The ring itself is beautiful and exactly how amazon described it. Shipping was faster than expected.Overall, very happy with the service and product from amazon.com....THANKS! <end>  dainty  This ring is just what i was hoping it would be. Tiny, and comfortable. <end>
 B0000AWXAT  14k White Gold 2.5mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 11 ||	  Simple beauty!!!  Comfortable and plain...If you're into blinding, eyeball-popping "bling-bling" this isn't for you; but if you're about subtle, classy, understated elegance, this should fit the bill perfectly. And how 'bout that price??!!! <end>  Perfect!  I've always wanted a white gold wedding band, and this ring is stunning, plus you can't beat the price!  -) My fiancee has always wanted yellow gold, but we purchased white gold wedding bands and he is more than satisfied, this is a very classy-looking ring. <end>  A Real Classic Beauty  This ring is so beautiful! It has a timeless look with a brilliant shine. I was so impressed with it and would highly recommend this ring to anyone who loves the look of a traditional wedding band. This ring is truly classy! <end>  Nice display  I wasn't expecting such a nice ring box.I was very happy with my purchase. <end>  Got this for my fiance  I bought this for my fiance to wear as an engagement-non-flashy-men's-ring and it's great. It's inexpensive so it's not taking away from the fund for the expensive wedding band he wants and it gives him something to wear to distinguish him from the "boyfriend" to the "fiance." It's great, has a nice shine, I highly recommend it. <end>  Big Repeated Horrible Problems!  We kept tring to order this ring... we must have sent it back about times... it kept coming back in a 2mm width when we wanted 2.5mm. W ended up not getting it at all. The thign is we already have the other one of the set (the girl's ring) and it s pretty great, so we kept it and now we need to find the mathing men's ring. Very disapointing process. Amazn is great and they were cool about giving us our money back, but we wanted this ring and they just couldn't figure out how to give us what we ordered... about 5 times! <end>

 B0000AWXVX  14k White Gold 4mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 11 ||	  Stunning!  This ring is stunning, gorgeous. And you can't beat the price!  -) My fiancee wanted gold, I wanted white gold, obviously I "won". But he is more than satisfied with the white gold, this is a very classy-looking ring. <end>  White Gold Ring  This is a nice ring. It is simple and elegant. The price was quite reasonable, when compared to other stores that I searched. I reccomend this ring as a wedding ring for a young couple just starting out. It would be great for a college student's budget. <end>  affordable, classy ring  This ring was well worth the price. It has a lovely shine and fits true to size. It is a very light, thin ring, so it you want something heavy with a thicker consistency to the metal, this may not be for you but as I said it is well worth the price! I'm very pleased. <end>  happy  This item came in only 2 days and in perfect condition! It is a very nice ring - shiny, smooth nice weight/width! Very impressed. <end>  Nice - worth the price  I bought this to wear everyday on my pinkie. It does scratch a bit but is worth the price. <end>  Nice and simple.  We wanted very simple gold wedding bands and we got exactly what we were looking for in these rings (my husband has the 5mm version). We're big on "sentimental value" over "flash", but IMHO, the rings look more expensive than what we paid. Very good value for the money. <end>  BEAUTIFUL RING!!!! NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER  It was exactly as described. Beautiful ring, perfect fit, classy finish. I know I would have probably paid double the price or more had I attempted to purchase similar from a jewelry store <end>  Scratched up in 5 days  While this ring is very comfortable and lightweight, I've worn it less than a week and the ring is in terrible condition. Nothing I've done in the few days it's been worn should have caused so many scratches and nicks (stay-at-home mom). <end>  loved it  it is a beautiful ring. very shiny and classy. my boyfriend loves wearing it. <end>  A Decent Ring For Work  I bought this ring here at Amazon a few years back, after losing my wedding band. I was about to buy two rings to replace the one lost; one would be a nicer ring with the comfort fit and high gloss, and one would be to wear at work, where it wouldn't matter if it got dinged and scraped up.I purchased the "nice" wedding band, which looks almost identical to this one, from a friend who manages a jewelry store. It has the comfort fit (rounding of the edges) and fit perfectly. That ring cost over twice as much as I paid for this ring.This ring I purchased only a few years ago for half of what it costs today to wear as my "work" ring. I didn't want to wear a nice ring to work and get it all scraped and messed up. It was a good decision.This ring does NOT have the comfort fit so you do feel the edges and on occasion they bite a little into your finger. Also, I bought this ring using the very same measurements I got when measured for the nicer ring, and this ring feels about a half size small compared to the nicer ring.All in all, it's held up well and even though it's all scraped up, dinged and dull, it still looks pretty nice on the finger. At twice the price I paid for it, you may be able to find a better deal. But if you are looking for a good second wedding band to work in, you may want to check this one out. <end>  Wedding Band  Ordered this as a replacement wedding band for my husband's lost ring. Great quality for the price -- about $200 cheaper than I could find at local jewelers. It's sleek, shiny and thin so if that's what you are looking for in a men's band--this is the ring for you. <end>  Great Ring for a Great Price  Loved this ring a lot. It is just plain regular ring as you can see in the store, but the Amazon price beat them all. Great value for your money.I know probably you thought that the ring may easily scratched. Well, that's may be true. The thing is there is no ring with this kind of polished (shiny) can be scratch proof.Well, buy this. You won't regret your choice. <end>  Just As it Looks  This ring looks great, it is just as shiny as it looks in the picture. It was true to its size. It was the best price I could find anywhere for this style and width. <end>  WONDERFUL!!  bought as a replacement when i LOST my diamond wedding set..ugg. true to size and wonderful quality! have had it for over a year now and it has held up wonderfully... will recommend to anyone needing a ring! <end>  wedding bands  They are just great, are exactly how i was expected and delivered in time. Thank you very much. <end>  Just what I was looking for  It's a simple band, but it looks great with my engagement ring. I haven't actually been able to wear much it yet to know anything about durability (my wedding is still a month away), but I am very pleased with how it looks. I am also pleased with Amazon's service with this product. <end>
 B0000AWY9H  14k White Gold 6mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 5 ||	  Beautiful Wedding Band  It was worth the wait. When I received this package I could not believe how beautiful the wedding band was. It was much better than many of the other bands I've been shopping for in my area. I would recommend purchasing wedding bands from Amazon.Not only that, paying was easy and I give an A++ for shipping. Very fast! <end>  Great ring!  My fiance and I just ordered these rings for our upcoming wedding, and we are so happy with them. The rings are beautiful, exactly what you would find in a jewelry store for a fraction of the price. (Trust me--we have been to the jewelry stores and know that this is a fraction of the price.) After getting both our wedding bands and my engagement ring from Amazon, I am ready to recommend their jewelry to anyone who asks. We were able to get rings that would have been out of our price range had we been forced to shop at jewelry stores.I didn't get out my measuring tape to make sure that they were exactly 6 mm, but the important thing is that the rings match each other. I can understand that that would be a disappointment if one was trying to make it match a ring one already owns. The person who said the ring was a little small is correct--be careful with the sizing, because my engagement ring, when I had it sized, is supposedly a 6.5 and on the first try, the wedding band I got in 6.5 was a little tight and I had to go up to a size 7. Fortunately, with Amazon, returns are easy and you only have to pay shipping, which is much cheaper than paying the $20 I had to pay to have my engagement ring sized down.For those with concerns about buying wedding bands or an engagement ring from Amazon, fear not; no one can tell the difference between these rings and ones from a jewelry store. The people I've let in on my "little secret" are amazed and say they never would have guessed that our rings all came from online.Everyone should start purchasing their rings from Amazon--the quality is great and the price is unbelievable. My fiance and I couldn't be happier. <end>  A little small...  The ring is beautiful, but the size is a little small. I was sized at more than one local jeweller as a 9, but the ring was much too small. <end>  Overall Nice Band  The shipping was very quick. The band was pretty nice for the price, however when I compared this with a 6mm band from a jewelry store it was not quite as thick. But overall it is a nice band. <end>  Other Reviews Correct  I read all the reviews before ordering this ring along with the 14k white gold 4mm size 6. A lot of other reviewers said that this ring ran small. My soon to be husband and I decided to go ahead and order it large and then just have it sized if it didn't fit. Well, it didn't fit. When we took it to a jeweler it was about a 1/4 of a size smaller than listed. But it looks great, and is very shiny. We had it sized and have no other complaints. <end>  Very nice!!!  Just got married and wanted something that was a little on the thick side... I was under the impression that the ring was going to be smaller based on customer reviews but I figure I would go for it and see for my self. The ring is perfect, very simple, looks very nice and it is just what I expected. <end>  wonderful product  lovely item. but i followed the other customer reviews and ordered a half size up because they said it was sized smaller... well, it was too big.so i ended up sending it back to get my normal size.the quality looks wonderful. <end>  Very nice.  My husband loves this ring. He says it's very comfortable. The sizing isn't to accurate though. It was off by I think 1/4 which was just enough for the ring not to fit. We had it sized rather than return it. This was the second time I had to buy the ring. The first time they sent me a size 12! I had to return it & buy another ring & wait for my money to be refunded. VERY frustrating. I didn't want to have to do the return/buy thing again, that why we just went & had it sized. I figured it would be easier that way. Besides, what if they sent the wrong size yet again? BUT, it is an attractive ring. My husband wears it every day & never takes it off, unlike his old ring. The end result was what we wanted despite the initial headaches. If if wasn't for all the sizing issues I would have given it 5 stars. <end>  Looks great and is worth the money  The ring looks good and is definitely worth the money. The ring is not that comfortable but you get used to it. It is slightly thinner than 6mm but hardly noticeable. It looks great though! You wont find anything better for the price. A good buy. <end>  just as advertised  The ring is quite nice. The real thing looks just like the picture. The size was very slightly small, but close enough. <end>  Great Value  I received this ring quickly and it was just as I expected. It is a great value and nice looking ring. I shopped around at jewelry stores for similar rings, but this is definitely a better value. 14K gold for the price of a 10K ring in jewelry stores. I ordered a larger size than necessary because of other reviews although I am not sure that was necessary because I am now paying to have it down-sized. <end>  very nice  This is a very beautiful ring, very nice for the price. However, it does run small, so I would recommend buying a size larger than you normally would. <end>  not quite  I received the ring in only 2 short days ... fantastic. However the ring was advertised as 6mm, and falls a full .5mm shy of the 6mm band I'm currently wearing. <end>

 B0000AWYJK  14k White Gold 6mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 11.5 ||	  Great Value  I received this ring quickly and it was just as I expected. It is a great value and nice looking ring. I shopped around at jewelry stores for similar rings, but this is definitely a better value. 14K gold for the price of a 10K ring in jewelry stores. I ordered a larger size than necessary because of other reviews although I am not sure that was necessary because I am now paying to have it down-sized. <end>  very nice  This is a very beautiful ring, very nice for the price. However, it does run small, so I would recommend buying a size larger than you normally would. <end>  not quite  I received the ring in only 2 short days ... fantastic. However the ring was advertised as 6mm, and falls a full .5mm shy of the 6mm band I'm currently wearing. <end>  Beautiful Wedding Band  It was worth the wait. When I received this package I could not believe how beautiful the wedding band was. It was much better than many of the other bands I've been shopping for in my area. I would recommend purchasing wedding bands from Amazon.Not only that, paying was easy and I give an A++ for shipping. Very fast! <end>  Great ring!  My fiance and I just ordered these rings for our upcoming wedding, and we are so happy with them. The rings are beautiful, exactly what you would find in a jewelry store for a fraction of the price. (Trust me--we have been to the jewelry stores and know that this is a fraction of the price.) After getting both our wedding bands and my engagement ring from Amazon, I am ready to recommend their jewelry to anyone who asks. We were able to get rings that would have been out of our price range had we been forced to shop at jewelry stores.I didn't get out my measuring tape to make sure that they were exactly 6 mm, but the important thing is that the rings match each other. I can understand that that would be a disappointment if one was trying to make it match a ring one already owns. The person who said the ring was a little small is correct--be careful with the sizing, because my engagement ring, when I had it sized, is supposedly a 6.5 and on the first try, the wedding band I got in 6.5 was a little tight and I had to go up to a size 7. Fortunately, with Amazon, returns are easy and you only have to pay shipping, which is much cheaper than paying the $20 I had to pay to have my engagement ring sized down.For those with concerns about buying wedding bands or an engagement ring from Amazon, fear not; no one can tell the difference between these rings and ones from a jewelry store. The people I've let in on my "little secret" are amazed and say they never would have guessed that our rings all came from online.Everyone should start purchasing their rings from Amazon--the quality is great and the price is unbelievable. My fiance and I couldn't be happier. <end>  A little small...  The ring is beautiful, but the size is a little small. I was sized at more than one local jeweller as a 9, but the ring was much too small. <end>  Overall Nice Band  The shipping was very quick. The band was pretty nice for the price, however when I compared this with a 6mm band from a jewelry store it was not quite as thick. But overall it is a nice band. <end>  Other Reviews Correct  I read all the reviews before ordering this ring along with the 14k white gold 4mm size 6. A lot of other reviewers said that this ring ran small. My soon to be husband and I decided to go ahead and order it large and then just have it sized if it didn't fit. Well, it didn't fit. When we took it to a jeweler it was about a 1/4 of a size smaller than listed. But it looks great, and is very shiny. We had it sized and have no other complaints. <end>  Very nice!!!  Just got married and wanted something that was a little on the thick side... I was under the impression that the ring was going to be smaller based on customer reviews but I figure I would go for it and see for my self. The ring is perfect, very simple, looks very nice and it is just what I expected. <end>  wonderful product  lovely item. but i followed the other customer reviews and ordered a half size up because they said it was sized smaller... well, it was too big.so i ended up sending it back to get my normal size.the quality looks wonderful. <end>  Very nice.  My husband loves this ring. He says it's very comfortable. The sizing isn't to accurate though. It was off by I think 1/4 which was just enough for the ring not to fit. We had it sized rather than return it. This was the second time I had to buy the ring. The first time they sent me a size 12! I had to return it & buy another ring & wait for my money to be refunded. VERY frustrating. I didn't want to have to do the return/buy thing again, that why we just went & had it sized. I figured it would be easier that way. Besides, what if they sent the wrong size yet again? BUT, it is an attractive ring. My husband wears it every day & never takes it off, unlike his old ring. The end result was what we wanted despite the initial headaches. If if wasn't for all the sizing issues I would have given it 5 stars. <end>  Looks great and is worth the money  The ring looks good and is definitely worth the money. The ring is not that comfortable but you get used to it. It is slightly thinner than 6mm but hardly noticeable. It looks great though! You wont find anything better for the price. A good buy. <end>  just as advertised  The ring is quite nice. The real thing looks just like the picture. The size was very slightly small, but close enough. <end>

The milgrain edge adds a touch of sophistication and the half round band gives the ring more interest compared to flat milgrain bands. It's also wears very comfortably on the finger. The price is great for a 14K gold band. Only wished it had more size and material(like 18K or platinum) options. But overall a great classic wedding band. <end>

 B0000AWZGI  14k White Gold 3mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  Loved it  Really, really comfortable. I never take it off, I wear it in place of my engagement ring and matching wedding band. Since those rings have stones, I am always taking them off to do housework and such. I also use to take them off to sleep. Now I keep them for nicer occasions. <end>  Great Ring - Fits Perfectly  I purchased this ring for my wedding band, and it looks wonderful! We looked at many jewelry stores for suitable rings, and I liked this style the best. But the prices at the stores for this type of ring were at least $150. So I checked amazon.com and found this ring. It arrived quickly and it looks beautiful. One cautionary note -- I originally ordered this ring in a size 5.5, which is the size of my engagement ring, but when it arrived, it was too small. I returned that ring and ordered another one in size 6, which fits perfectly. So if you order this ring, I would order a half-size larger than what you usually need. <end>  14K white gold ring 3mm  I liked this ring it was actually really nice. It was small, but you are looking for something more affordable, and you like white gold this is the ring for you! <end>  excellent value  I ordered this ring to wear with my diamond wedding ring, it just needed a little something extra. The ring looks excellent, adds just a little oomph that my ring needed. And for the price, the value was excellent. Band would be a little too narrow to wear alone, but with another ring it looks (and feels) great. <end>  Beautiful  This is my husband's wedding band. He's had it for two years and it is still as beautiful as the day we got married! <end>  Enchanted  Very pleased with the purchase.... we bought 2 rings, one for my husband, very pleased with the items..... really a great deal for the price.... we love them <end>
 B0000AWZST  14k White Gold 4mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 7 ||	  I would give this 1.5 stars if I could  My husband did a wonderful job picking out my engagement ring (a 1.75 carat princess cut center stone and two half carat trillion side stones) but I did a poor job picking this as my wedding band. I knew that we would upgrade our wedding bands later on so I picked this one because I thought that it would look fine, it wasn't a big deal, and it would sit nicely with my ring. I'm glad that we didn't purchase two as top and bottom band. Nevertheless, the ring was initially fine but we're in year 3 of our marriage and the ring has turned some bizarre color that looks horrible with my other ring. I've tried getting it cleaned and it'll come back to a relative state of ehh and a week later it'll look ehh again. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this ring....I can only give it a blah. <end>

 B0000AX0WV  14k White Gold Diamond Pretzel Heart Pendant, 18" ||	  Beautiful  Awesome pendant in the shape of a pretzel. The ends of the &quot;pretzel&quot; hang down below the actual shape. The entire pendant is in 14K WHITE gold.But be warned. The picture you see is enlarged to show the beautiful detail of the pendant and diamonds. When seen in person, you cannot see the diamonds well.If you love white gold, as I do, the diamonds are not what attracts you to this piece. They are only an added touch to make a tiny sparkel whenever the light hits the pendant just right.Wonderful for Valentine's Day, birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas time, or simply to tell how much you care. <end>
 B0000AYOMU  14k White Gold Checkerboard Faceted Aquamarine (6x6mm) and Diamond Ring, Size 7 ||	  this ring is stunning! so says one person  I was looking to replace a blue topaz Cartier Tank ring knockoff that I had gotten at Costco for about 150, and recently lost. At the time I bought that ring, I had actually wanted an aquamarine stone, but such is the shopping experience at Costco  no variety. I was sad to lose the ring, but when the opportunity came up to seek a replacement, I thought I'd try online at Amazon. This time, I was going to do it right and get the gemstone I really wanted.Initially I was disappointed that, for this ring, the 2 pictures that were provided by Amazon only showed the top of the ring at an angle. The second photo was a true profile, which was great, but not nearly enough to cut the mustard. There should definitely be at least one true aerial view of the ring to get a sense of what it looks like when you are staring straight down at it. And because jewelry shopping is a very tactile and look-and-feel kind of experience, online jewelry shopping is conceptually at a severe disadvantage. To make up for this, there should be no fewer than 4 pictures of any piece of jewelry that is sold online - this would make it much easier for customers to make a decision, and likely minimize the number of returns. Regardless, I worked with what I had, and I made the decision that it looked great on Amazon, and that I would buy it.When I received the ring, I was very pleased with how classy and beautiful it looked in the box. I was really surprised at how engagement ring-ish it appeared, because the hue of the stone was so subtle that it could almost appear clear at some angles. In the pictures, it looks like a much deeper blue. (Luckily, I wear it on my middle finger, so as not to give off any incorrect signals.) The picture also makes the metal look much heavier and more substantial than it really ended up being. The top half is more or less hollow - and it's hard to tell that from the picture (though, if Amazon indicated metal weight in grams, the customer might be able to at least guess. Sigh.) I'm not saying that the ring is weak or malleable, by any means. The metal is quite strong - it's just significantly lighter than I expected. The fake Cartier Tank ring that this was replacing was very bold and robust and it felt heavy and solid, qualities that I really liked and had hoped to recapture a bit of with this new ring. In general, this aquamarine ring is much daintier than I had expected from the images shown, and not at all the solid, strong piece I had gone in looking for.Though expectations were different from reality, fortunately, for me, I actually don't mind the differences and I quite like the ring. This may not be true for every customer, so it's safe to say that a recommendation from me should be taken with a huge grain of salt! I can see how every piece of jewelry could conceivably get a positive recommendation from at least one person, and we know that we've all seen ugly jewelry before, so who is to say you won't find this ring to be hideous? For me and my specific hand, the ring is a perfect size, perfect color, and perfect style. And I really owe it all to luck, make no mistake. It easily could have gone the other way.The most important point to take away from this review is to be sure that whichever merchant you buy from has an excellent return policy (which Amazon does). When making expensive purchases like jewelry, sight unseen, it's important to know that you can easily return the item. Only if you are my "hand-twin" can I unequivocally and in good conscience recommend this ring to you. Otherwise, all we can do is hope for the best. <end>

I wasn't too sure about the size from the description and they are a bit smaller than I would have liked.The stones are a good quality and I enjoy wearing them. <end>  Nice for the price  These are very nice stud earrings. I got them at a great sale price. They are small, not flashy, but with a good medium purple amethyst gemstone. They sit well on the ear and are comfortable. Adequate gold setting. <end>  Beautiful Earrings! Perfect for Fall!  I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold, they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything. They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they'd be really small, but they are not. In spite of the decent size of the stones, these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them, at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I'm considering buying an additional pair, just for that purpose! <end>  Dark  Lovely earrings, however they are a bit darker than those pictured. I would have preferred a little lighter color, but these are gorgeous anyway. <end>  Ok but expected a bit more  I purchased these as a gift for my boyfriends mom. I am really disappointed in the packaging. They came in a small box with some filler and the earrings themselves are in a very cheap little bag. I was expecting something I could just wrap up. Now I need to search out something to make it a presentable gift. The earrings themselves are nice enough, seem a little on the cheap side for the posts. I guess you get what you pay for, $40 worth anyway. The color of the stones is very nice. I wouldn't recommend this item to a friend. I am keeping them because they do match a necklace I got her for Christmas last year. <end>  gift  this was a gift and she loved them, they are a little small but amazing for the price i paid. the posts could be longer, however, because she has thick lobes they run tight and have fallen off once. keep that in mind if you have thick lobes. <end>  just what I was looking for!  My husband gave me an amethist pendant 2 years ago as a gift. Since then, I have been searching for matching earrings. My son gave me an Amazon gift card for Mother's Day this year and I found these earrings. They are beautiful and now I have a complete set! <end>  Okay if you like lavendar  I have no complaints about the quality of the setting, gold is very high right now so the fact that you can get these for less than 50 bucks is pretty impressive, and the setting is very nice and solid. The color of the stones in mine though, well...they were very very light purple. It wasn't my cup of tea, I was hoping for a darker purple, a more saturated color, but if you like pastel purple, then you'll love these. The cut and clairty was good, and the size was nice, I just wish they had been a little darker since I'm very fair skinned- being too light just means they disappear on me. My teenage daughter loves them though, and she's worn them on a few special occasions. I'd certainly rec. these earrings for anyone looking for a nice gift, especially for a teenager or young woman. They're comfortable to wear and look clean and sophisticated- great for casual wear or when you want just a little bit of color. <end>  Completely satisfied  I think I went to every jewelry store in the area and no one had smoky quartz anything. I found these and had them shipped right away. They were perfect. They even matched the ring my mother had. She loves them. <end>  Birthday!  )  My husband gave these to me for a birthday present. They are beautiful. Great size, not to small and not to large and not to heavy! Perfect!!! <end>  Smoky quartz earrings, 14K yellow gold  Very comfortable to wear; nice size; good stone color. Would buy again. <end>  More likely baby pink than purple  They are nice size, but color is not very bright.My pair is almost like baby pink color. I still love them though. <end>  My wife loves these earrings  My wife absolutly loves these earrings,but she said I missed the sale price, oh well! <end>  Okay  The earrings are as pictured. However, the size is 7 x 5mm which are small. The picture gives you an impression that the earrings are larger and flat.Not what I thought I was ordering. The setting is nice. <end>  Very Nice!  These were a Mother's Day gift for my mom. Her birthday is not in February, but these were so pretty that I knew she would appreciate them anyway. The color is beautiful and a deep, rich purple. They were well set in the prongs and not loose as sometimes stones are. Very cute and look nice. These are just the right size and do not overpower the ears. <end>  Beautiful!  I bought these for my mother as a birthday present. I was a little scared of the carat size (I'm not an experienced jewelry shopper). I also personally hate gold but the brown gem perfectly compliments the 14K gold setting. I'm pleasantly surprised by the size of these earrings. They are the perfect size. I thought I'd be buying something tiny but they're anything but. They're not gigantic either. After she opened her present, I spent a few minutes looking over each stone. There was no scratches, no visible imperfections with the settings.My mom has sensitive ears. She has a hard time find earrings that won't irritate and cause infections; the 14K gold seems to not affect her ears. She wears them all the time as a result. It makes me slightly jealous. I wish I would have bought a pair for myself as well.I'd highly recommend these earrings. They are very beautiful and well-crafted! <end>  Just what I wanted  I was afraid these earrings would be too large but they are just what I wanted. Not too small as to be invisible but not large enough to weight down my earlobes. Color is beautiful, cut is symmetrical. I'm very happy with this purchase. <end>  way too small  These earrings appear to be a decent size in the photograph, but when I received them they were not much bigger than small diamond studs. They were so tiny and because of the subtle color, any one would have to look hard just to be able to tell I was even wearing earrings. For the price I paid I need a smoky earring that people will see. Not one that people need glasses to find. If these earrings were larger I might have really liked them. But for now I'm sorry I will be sending these back. <end>  Smaller than I thought  I purchased these earrings since I needed a pair of smoky-quartz earrings. When I received them I was disappointed with the size. I think these types of products should be shown in their true size rather than magnifying them to look larger than they actually are. These earring are okay, but if I had seen these in a store I would not have bought them. <end>  A great buy  If you are looking for a lovely set of smoky quartz earrings at a fantastic price, these are a must. The stones are quality and a lovely smoky color. The size provides versatility from casual to dressy. <end>  Happy!!!!  Lovely pair of earrings in just the right size...perfect for double pierced ears with a coordinating larger hoop or dangle earring, or to wear by themselves. Rich brown coloring. <end>  Nice but quite small  These earrings are smaller than I expected them to be and do not show at all in my ears. Maybe it's because my hair is brown plus their size...?The gold in them is substantial and the stones are a reasonable quality for the price. If you purchase these and prefer earrings that are femnine and delicate, you'll enjoy owning these and they are worth the price of $39 <end>  False ad?  The product was great just as advertised, but the ad did say "free shipping". I don't consider the handling charge FREE. The product is great and at my age, purple goes with everything. <end>  Nice and light  The earrings look just like the picture, the stud stays secure in place, the stones are lightweight and comfortable to wear. <end>  Amethyst Stud Earrings-loved them  I bought the earrings for my niece and was impressed with the size. They're gorgeous. Definitely worth the money. <end>  Earrings  Bought this item to go with the pendant and the ring. Nicely put together and turned out to be a good buy, very nice item. <end>  What is not to love  These match the ring I ordered. I love the emeral cut of the stone. I wear a lot of brown in the winter <end>  Great complement to Amazon's 14k Yellow Gold Smoky-Quartz 3-Stone Ring, Size 7  Bought as complement to the ring I recently ordered as a birthday present for my wife. She took one look at the ring and fell in love.My choice was clear - I had to get it for her, and these earrings perfectly completed the set.The quartz sparkles, clear and smoky and offsets the warm glow of the 14k gold setting just right. She gets compliments wherever she wears them, and she wears them often.Very well done! <end>  Love these earrings!  Last year we bought a ring with smokey quartz and this decided to get matching earrings. These earrings are beautiful! They are a perfect match for the ring! Love em!! <end>  mr  Product was a fair representation of picture of ear rings in add, it arrived in timely fasion and was apprecated by its recipiant. <end>  Pretty, but a little small  These were a Christmas gift for my girlfriend;she wears a lot of beige and browns and the color is a beautiful "smoky quartz".They are a little small but very nicequality and unusual color. <end>  My thoughts  I like the earrings themselves - extremely pretty - they are what I expected. The only thing that disappointed me was the size of the backings...really SMALL and which I had to replace. I'm sure I would lose these earrings if I did not replace them -- they should have come with bigger, tighter backings. <end>  Are not as they appear in print  The smoky-quartz stone was very light and appeared just lightly tinted. In addition, there was no way to determine the actual size of the stones from the online description. They were much smaller than I anticipated. They might have been a nice earring under other circumstances, but it was not what I thought I was ordering. They might be a nice earring for a teen girl. <end>
 B0000AZ110  14k Yellow Gold Four Prong 6mm Round Amethyst Stud Pendant, 18" ||	  Satisfied Customer  I was very apprehensive about buying a necklace online. I had searched for this necklace style at the Mall and could not find it for a better price. I purchased this beautiful pendent for my daughter as a holiday gift and she loves it. As well, I was proud to give it to her.I will be more comfortable buying jewelry from Amazon from now on. Amazon had detailed information about it. In addition, their learning guide was very helpful. <end>
 B0000AZ117  14k White Gold Three-Stone Round Emerald w/ Diamond (H-SI2 0.04ctw) Ring, Size 5 ||	  Not what was promised (the stars are for the ring I got)  This ring was ordered for me as a gift. When I got it I discovered that the ring I got was NOT the ring advertised. The setting while still 3 round emeralds is completely different. While I like the setting it is not an appropriate policy to advertise one thing and deliver another. Also, the description for this ring is completely wrong. It mentions oval stones and these are round. Someone should really check this site for accuracy. I like the setting I got so I rated that but as far as delivering what is advertised - I'd have to give you zero stars. <end>  Setting is Different, But Better  The setting is different than pictured, but it's far more beautiful. It has diamonds in the gallery and the emeralds are at a high profile.The emeralds were also a good deal better quality than those pictured. They are a stunning kelly green, not the milky hue as pictured. As far as I can tell, I got a much better ring than anticipated and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. <end>  Ring was a wonderful gift  This ring was purchased for my daughter. I found the ring to be of better construction than viewed. The mounting is much more secure than pictured; less likely for the emeralds to come loose. The clarity of the emeralds are wonderful for the price given. The white gold has a brilliant polished finish. You can also see the intricacy in the designs along the front/back/sides. It was also a true fit per the sizing offered. My daughter loved the ring. I would recommend this as a purchase for anyone looking for a resonably priced emerald w/diamond accents. Amazon.com offers excellent quality that you would definitely have to shop around in brick and mortar establishments to find the same type of price and quality. <end>
 B0000AZ12U  14k White Gold 11mm Square Blue Topaz w/ Diamond Accents (I-I1 0.025ctw) Pendant, 18" ||	  Love this necklace  I got this necklace as a gift and I love it. The blue topaz is amazing, eye catching, and very large!!! The cut of the topaz makes it shine in the most amazing way. The only problem with the necklace is the chain is a bit too thin and short for this pendant. In fact I've had to put it on an entirely different chain that is longer and thicker. The chain that comes with the pendant is very thin and inspite it's beauty I thought it wasn't enough to keep the very heavy pendant from easily breaking loose. <end>
 B0000AZ14R  14k Yellow Gold Channel Set 3.0mm Square Multi-Color Gemstone Ring, Size 6 ||	  More beautifully in person!!  This ring is just gorgeous! The gemstones are 100 times more beautifully in person. It comes in a ring box and another slightly larger square box so it's easy to wrap, and might elude to there being something other then jewelry in the box. The ring itself is not to big, or ostentatious, and gives that nice flawless look of elegance. Very good value for the number of stones placed on this ring! Hopefully my mother will like this gift as much as I did, when I give it to her on Christmas morning. <end>
 B0000AZ1B4  14k Yellow Gold 8x6mm Oval Opal and Diamond (I-I1 0.18ctw) Ring, Size 7 ||	  Elegant BlingBling  She just loves the ring. Really high quality for the price. <end>
 B0000AZ1E3  14k Yellow Gold 4x3mm Oval Sapphire and Diamond (H-SI2 0.06ctw) Ring, Size 5 ||	  I would give it less than one star if I could  I bought one of these for my mom--Mother's Day present. She loved it. A few months later I learned that a stone had fallen out of it. Too late to return it to Amazon, so I bought her another one. The very same day I gave it to her, the exact same stone had fallen out and was lost. These rings are cute but the fact that the same stone falls out with minimal wear tells me they are not well put together.I have purchased inexpensive rings from Amazon before and never had this problem. <end>  Lovely Ring-Great Price!  This ring is absolutely beautiful. The picture does not do it justice; the sapphires are a deeper, dark blue that offsets the diamonds beautifully. My only complaint is the limited size availability as I had to have mine resized. <end>
 B0000AZ1E9  14k Yellow Gold 4x3mm Oval Sapphire and Diamond (H-SI2 0.06ctw) Ring, Size 6 ||	  I would give it less than one star if I could  I bought one of these for my mom--Mother's Day present.

 B0000AZVJS  18k White Gold Round Ruby (2.1mm) and Round Diamond (0.22ctw) Hoop Earrings ||	  High quality little sparklers.  These earrings are small, but well made and sparkly.The rubies are of excellent quality, and I'm happy to adopt these as my new everyday earring. The hinge back seems well made, and I believe that these will hold up well.Excellent buy at the sale price! <end>
 B0000AZVTP  18k White Gold Round Diamond Double Heart Pendant (1/4ctw), 18" ||	  Lovely  I'll make this short. This is VERY lovely, in WHITE GOLD. I have not seen many lovely white gold pieces. But be warned, the photo is enlarged so you may see the exquisite details and luster. The diamonds are not see easily seen in normal size.Great gift for birthdays, anniversaries, Christmases, and Valentine's Day! <end>
 B0000AZW4K  14k Yellow Gold Plain Cross on 18" Yellow Gold Chain ||	  nice  The cross is nice, but beware of the chain. It is very thin. I bought a replacement for it or otherwise, I would have had to buy a new pendant as well. <end>  Great  I have no complaints the cross is nice and was what I was looking for. Also, I recieved it in only 3 days and it wasn't expected for another 5 days!!!!!!!! <end>
 B0000AZW4T  14k Yellow Gold Polished Stick Crucifix on 18" Yellow Gold Chain ||	  Nice, but not really for adults  Maybe I should have realized from the 18" chain that this was only for kids, but the chain's length is not a problem for me. On the other hand, the clasp is extremely small (roughly 1/4"), making it difficult to take the item on and off.I like the crucifix, but I wish the clasp had been designed for adult fingers. <end>
 B0000AZW52  14k Yellow and White Gold Hollow Swirl Style Cross on 18" Yellow Gold Chain ||	  No size description  Was disappointed in the size of the cross (and chain). Product size was listed as 3.2 x 2.6 x 1.5 inches -- but this is the size of the box, therefore it is very hard to judge how large it is. <end>
 B0000AZW53  14k Yellow Gold Cross Sash Pendant, 18" ||	  Great Cross - Mediocre Chain  The Gold Cross with White Gold sash is a very nice addition to anyone's collection!I was not completely happy with the quality of the chain that shipped with the cross, however, I viewed that as a minor detail and purchased a sturdier gold snake chain with a more secure clasp to use with the cross. <end>  So Elegant !!!  The delivery of this item was swift...so I was very pleased with that...I am looking for some pieces of jewerly that I could wear with any other pieces of jewerly (gold or silver) and this cross definetly fit the description.But I must say I was kind of disappointed with the size of the chain and the cross itself...the chain does look like it will break with the wrong movement of your body...and being that the cross is small itself, if the chain popped you wouldnt know the cross fell because its SO SMALL!!! But with about $15-$20 you can buy a better bigger chain to suit.But besides that, I really think the cross is ELEGANT!! It will go perfect for a causal day/night night out where you have a low cut shirt that leaves your neck wide open...it will go perfect to fill that gap. It adds style, class, and elegance. <end>
 B0000AZW62  14k White Gold Freeform/Dancing Cross on 18" White Gold Chain ||	  Beautiful  I bought this for my brother. It is a beautiful cross, especially if you want something a little different without being too ornate. <end>  Dancing Cross for a Dancer  I purchased this cross for my best friend of 20+ years who has been a dancer for all of that time. I had it sent to me first for inspection before I gave it to her. I thought it was beautiful - the shape of the cross suits the person and her God-given talent of dance. I recommend this gift for a personal gift that's not too flashy but very classy! <end>
 B0000AZW6V  14k Yellow Gold Solid Polished and Satin Finish St. Florian Medal on 18" Yellow Gold Chain ||	  firefighter enblem  The medal I purchased from your company is an exccellent giftfor firefighters to wear. He is so excited and shows it off toother firefighters.Thanks,Beverly <end>
 B0000AZW73  14k Yellow Gold Hollow Polished "Family Unity" Charm on 18" Yellow Gold Chain ||	  Simply beautiful  As soon as I saw this, I knew I had to get it for my mom. She loves jewelery, especially if it has sentimental value, and this reminded me of how close our family is. I love its simplicity and I think that it's beautiful. I haven't given it to her yet, but I know that she will love it too. I was very happy with this purchase. <end>
 B0000AZW84  14k White Gold 3mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 9 ||	  Great ring  I apreciated the high quality of this item and was pleased that it was even more attractive than the picture depicts. It was the perfect fit and a great choice to go with my 1/2 carat marquis diamond. I had difficulty finding something that would fit with my ring but this was a perfect match. <end>  Nice Ring  High quality ring - my wife and I have worn our rings for over a year and they are holding up well. The ring comes in a nice box and is classy, understated and a great value. <end>  Satisfied Customer  The ring was shipped in a timely manner and it was as described. I am very pleased with it. <end>  NIce!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was much cuter than the web visual. Actually, we were afraid it would be large, but it wasn't. It was just the right size, & he loved it. <end>  3 mm Plain Half Round Band  Love the ring although I found it was too thin so I returned it and got the 5 mm ring instead. I was looking for a more substantial band to wear by itself in place of my normal 2 (diamond) rings, esp. when I am running or traveling. For anyone wanting this 3 mm size, though, it is a beautiful ring. <end>
 B0000B10D1  Sterling Silver 11.8mm Figaro Necklace, 22" ||	  Gumball machine jewelry  This actually looks real nice on the website. I ordered it for my wife last Christmas. When I received it, I was dissapointed at its quality. It wasn't worth the shipping charge (free). I decided to give it to my girlfriend instead. <end>
 B0000B10IL  Sterling Silver Polished Rolling Ring, Size 7 ||	  Nice, but watch the size  I ordered this ring in my normal size. Each individual ring fit, but when put together as a whole ring, the angles made the ring too small. It is very light; it doesn't feel solid. Still, I plan on reordering one size larger. <end>  Not so good  The ring was pretty good at first, but then it got all these scratches. The shininess went away easily. <end>  Sterling Silver Polished Rolling Ring, Size 5  I really liked this ring but I never wear it because when you wash your hands it rolls right off LOL <end>
 B0000B357T  14k Yellow Gold Zig-Zag Stampato Bracelet, 7" ||	  Nice weave  I like the way the weave is done. It doesn't catch on clothes, a big concern when I buy bracelets. <end>
 B0000B357X  14k Yellow and White Gold 7mm Woven Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  I LOVE THIS PIECE!  Gorgeous, sturdy and very unique! A GR8 value for the money! <end>
 B0000B357Z  14k White Gold Satin/Polished Heart Necklace, 17" ||	  SO CUTE  VERY cute for the price. The little hearts around it are just perfect <end>
 B0000B35CO  14k Yellow Gold Perfect Fit Earrings ||	  I was a little skeptical about ordering jewelry without seeing it...  ...but these earrings are gorgeous. They are very lightweight and have a beautiful polished finish. I always buy 14k earrings for my daughter for Christmas, and she was thrilled with these. Highly recommended. <end>  Truly Perfect for me!  I have longed for gold hoop earrings for years. These seemed liked they were the ones! But I waited a while, still debating..... finally 'went for it' and got a pair. I haven't regretted it at all. I find these earrings comfortable, and I like the way they look on me. I am very happy with these and recommend these beauties!..... Now, if they would make them in white gold........... <end>  Great Gift  I bought these earrings for my Stepmother in Seattle, so I never actually saw them. Now she is a refined person with classy taste, so you can't just get her any piece of junk. She said they were perfect and she loved them. That's a great recommendation! <end>  Beautiful and super comfortable!  I love these earrings! They are really beautiful and super-duper comfortable! The look great on and don't get in the way when I am on the telephone! <end>  Perfect Earrings!  These are very, very light-weight earrings that can be modified slightly to form a perfect fit to the earlobe. The look is a classic gold hoop with a horseshoe shape fitting very close to the ear, like a "huggie" earring, but larger. The size is perfect for daily wear, but would look great for a night out. The u-shaped clasp holds the earring on securely. Great bang for the buck when worn. <end>
 B0000B35CU  14k Yellow Gold and Sterling Silver 4mm French Rope Necklace, 18" ||	  I feel like a princess  From the moment I saw the large blue box which the necklace came in, I felt like a princess - or Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. This necklace is perfect for my wedding dress. Our wedding bands are white and yellow gold with a rope pattern, and I was looking for something that fit that theme. I was worried a little bit, as my dress has silver overlay, but the yellow gold is much more delicate in real life than in the picture. The silver rope is more substantial and looks like it is worth a great deal more. This necklace absolutely sparkles, and the picture does it very little justice. In fact, I almost unordered it but I am so glad I didn't. All the women in my office were gathered about in awe. The comments ranged from "that is truly beautiful" to "you're making too much money" to "I have never seen anything like that before." All exactly what you want to hear about a reasonably valued piece of jewelry. This was a good first experience with buying jewelry over the internet. <end>  Worth more than it's weight in gold  An inexpensive suprise. Great appearance, looks like it's worth twice the price.. <end>  Very Rich Piece for the Price  Am completely thrilled with this purchase! This is an excellent, thick, solid piece of jewelry for the man in your life. The multi-tone silver/gold look is a multi-wearable accessory for a special occassion or for everyday wear. This is a wonderful affordable gift item that will be sure to please. <end>  jewelry  Wow...Heavy....Pretty....I bought one...Loved it. (gift) Bought another.....Then two more and will get a fifth one..Good quality..Makes an excelent gift.. <end>  Very Impressed!  I was a little skeptical purchasing jewelry online, but when this came in I was very pleased. This is definitely more stunning in person. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother. It looks absolutely fabulous on her! <end>  Much more silver than gold  I was after a two-tone gold and silver chain, and the picture was just what I wanted. However, when you wear the necklace, the silver overwhelms the gold, and it appears that you a wearing just a silver chain. However, the quality is excellent, and the chain has a good weight to it when you wear it. I should have bought the 3mm chain instead of the 4 mm, as you might see the gold better against a smaller silver link. <end>  Perfect gift for young woman  I gave this necklace as a graduation gift. I don't know much about what young people like, but this was a home run! Every time I see the young lady she is wearing it. <end>  my gift to myself  I searched for a double color chain and was very pleased with the one I found at Amazon.com. The price was good and the quality is amazing A+++ <end>  Perfect necklace  This two-toned rope necklace is the perfect length, width. I love it. I wear it ALL the time. It goes with everything. I'm pretty rough on jewelry. I've broken so many of those thin little gold chains with a pendant. I don't think that will ever happen with this necklace. It's just what I've been looking for. Love it!!!!! <end>  Thick and Rich  This is a great necklace. It feels rich and substantial. I wish it were longer but it is as it is advertised. Lovely. Hard to fasten by yourself though. <end>  perfect  I love this necklace. It was perfect for my daughter's silver and gold cartouche. <end>  Absolutely beautiful!  This chain was even more beautiful than I anticipated. The gold winding around the silver made the chain just gleam! <end>  Great Piece  The necklace looks far more valuable than what I paid for it. It is a nice weight and the silver and gold go well together. <end>  Really nice necklace!  This necklace is very thick and excellent for my sterling silver pendant. The gold chain twisted into it is a very nice touch and allows the chain to go with silver and gold colored pendants. <end>  Looks expensive  This piece is much thicker & heavier than I expected; it looks much more expensive than it was. Very good value. <end>  14k Yellow Gold and Silver 4mm French Rope Necklace, 18"  Beautiful. Looking for a bracelet to match. <end>
 B0000B35CX  14k Yellow Gold Single Oval Hoop Earrings ||	  Perfect  These are beautiful earrings. They're a great size, not too large and not too small. They are shiny and feel very sturdy. <end>  These Are the Best Earrings!  I purchased these earrings after losing a set of hoops I had worn for years. Being used to hoops I could not go back to posts. I looked in the local discount stores and found their earrings to be overpriced and cheap looking. These are elegant looking and seem to glow. They are also extremely comfortable and weightless. I spend a lot of time on the phone and they are not even bothersome there. They are the perfect size and weight for an all around earring. An added plus is that they don't irritate my sensitive ears. <end>
 B0000B35D3  Duragold 14k Yellow Gold Half Round Hoop Earrings ||	  Thought they would be thicker  but I really like them as they are - a perfect size if you want to look professional, perfect for traveling, the clasp is snug and the look is great. And gold doesn't irritate! <end>  Great Pair of Earrings  I read all of the other people who rated these earrings before purchasing and they were all positive. I love these earrings and wear them every day. They can be worn dressed up or down. I wear two sets of earrings and these go great with my diamond studs for dress or just plain gold studs for every day. The closure is very secure and the price was excellent. I highly recommend. <end>  1st Anniversary Present  Great product. Perfect size. So comfortable that I have to check to make sure they are still there since I wear them 24/7. <end>  Waaaaay too Small  I ordered these to replace a pair i wore for years and had recently lost one.These are less than half the size i anticipated so sent them right back.Really disappointed. They are soooooo small...not as big around as thetip of my pinky finger. <end>  I love it!  Excellent earrings. These earrings are small and shiny. I wore these earrings a couple times. I have to give these earrings to my niece, she likes small everything. <end>  Love the product but...  I love these earrings! I actually purchased these to replace ones that I finally lost after ten years. However I was disappointed with Amazon as I found them $50 dollars cheaper at pagoda.com which is a mall piercing place and they have an online site as well. The ones on Pagoda are exactly the same, so I called Amazon to see if they would price match but they wont so I'll be returning them! <end>  small hoops  Lovely rings if you wish for a small hoop you will not go wrong with these. Lock securely. Look great. <end>  14K Yellow Gold Half Round hoops  Very good product. Simple but elegant. Wife had previously lost one of her other earrings and this was the best replacement. She enjoys them a lot. <end>  My Wife loved them!  Bought them for my wife as a stocking stuffer for this Christmas because I overheard her say that she broke one of her earrings that she wore to the office. She likes them because they are great for the office (she's a banker) and she can sleep in them also. So I got a lot of brownie points going into 2013! Real good deal also. I was about to pay twice the amount for a similar pair at a local jewelry store. <end>  Love them  Of all the earrings I received for Christmas these were my favorite. Maybe because I bought them for myself. Nice, simple and smallish gold hoops. They are not as big as you would expect judging by the picture shown. After doing a little research on duragold (because really, what is it?) it appears to have a slightly lower percentage of gold in it and reportedly the strongest gold alloy ever. Whatever that is. Still, I love these except the post is a little long and gets caught on my clothes. I'd buy them again and I would buy them as a gift. <end>  Delicate Yet Durable  When it comes to jewelry, earrings are my weakness. Although I already had several pairs of hoop earrings, these caught my eye about 18 months ago. I justified the purchase because the design and buttery color reminded me of the classic wide wedding band a favorite aunt wore for a half-century.When they arrived, I was pleased at their curvature, both vertically and horizontally. The hue and luster say "high quality" and the delicate proportions are the right size for everyday professional wear. For the price, the craftsmanship was much more detailed than I expected. They are comfortable and secure on the ear, snapping securely in place and staying put, even on those tiring 18-hour days.An unexpected bonus is how well they serve as travel earrings. When I'm traveling on business, I take only one pair of earrings. Until I'd had these for a few weeks, the earrings I usually took were posts with independent backs. These are a step up, both in appearance and in staying on, even when I wear headphones or doze off inflight.With worldwide gold prices heading ever upward, these earrings continue to be a solid value, well worth their cost. <end>  earrings  A lot smaller than I thought...I did read what it said, still just had them pictured differently even though I measured them on "paper", so really check the size..however on the positive side I have worn them constantly..slept in them, showered wearing them for days at a time and they are still there, clasps are very solid, excellent quality and actually because they are small, are light so don't pull on your lobes <end>  Exactly as described  I'm quite happy with these and writing to say so, because other users' comments were very helpful to me--especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial  i.e., though diminutive, they have bulk so are visible, with nice warm glow. <end>  Both elegant and everyday  I love these earrings. They're quite small, but they never catch on anything, and add a bit of polish to whatever you're wearing. <end>  Great workplace earrings  I love the earrings. The hoops are small enough to wear to work and large enough to be noticed. <end>  Good purchase  These small gold hoops are a nice purchase - good quality. They don't have much weight or heft to them, but they have good color and shine. <end>  Thrilled!  These are exactly what I wanted. I had some reservations about size based on other reviews, but these are exactly as pictured with the measurements you provided.They are extremely classy and more substantial than I thought they would be. I bought them to replace some really cheap ones that lost their shine.I will definitely be wearing these 24/7. Very comfortable. Nice packaging for a gift. <end>  Great everyday earrings!  I bought these earrings last October 2007 and they are still my favorite earrings. They are indeed small, light weight, comfortable to wear and they have nice color and shine to them. I suspect they are hollow and at first I was not happy with that. But once I put them on and felt how comfortable they were, I was actually glad they were so light weight. I do not want to weigh down and stretch out my ear lobes with heavy "every day" earrings. Although they are light weight, they are still sturdy and well made. I even sleep in them and the clasp has never failed me. I have very long hair and they do not get caught up or entangled. I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Lovely small hoops - great purchase  Hoops exactly as seen in the picture, they are indeed light (as the price suggests, since gold is sold by weight). They look elegant and polished, though, and the good clasp is a definite plus. I always keep losing hoops because they fly off my ear somehow, and these have stayed put, no problem. All in all a good purchase. ------I have had them for a few months now, and so excited that I have not lost them as usually happens with hoops. I have other hoops from a different maker, have to be constantly vigilant because they will end up on the floor or in my clothes every time I brush my hair with my hand or use the cel. Not this pair, these are just great and stay put, no worries. <end>  Wonderful  These earrings are beautiful. They are great when dressed to go out or when casual. I travel regularly and usually do not take more than one pair of earrings. This is the pair of earrings I take. They fit for all occasions. They are perfect. <end>  Good but not perfect replacement  I needed to replace a favorite pair of earrings; so, of course, nothing was going to be perfect, but I like these and have worn them quite a few times and will continue to. <end>  Guys?  Just curious -- Any guys purchase this for themselves, and what do you think of them? <end>  Not too big, not too small, just right  I own several pair of huggy hoops. These have been my "go to" for everyday wear. They don't crowd my lobe, very comfortable. <end>  Perfect size  I ordered these earrings to replace a pair that had broken. They were perfect and just what I was looking for. Good size and color. <end>  Duragold 14k Yellow Gold Half Round Hoop Earrings  I am less than happy about the earrings as they are not as presented on the site.I was seeking earrings that are 0.75 to 1 inch in diameter. These rings were presented as being .75 inch in diameter but when we opened the package - the rings were less than about .5 inch in diameter. Oh well. <end>  Less gold than expected  The hoop part of the earring was thinner than expected, but they look OK. Glad I got it on sale. <end>  Gold earrings  Love these earrings! I don't understand why they call them a half round hoop earring? They are lightweight, small, but not so small you can't get them in your ears. Very happy with them! <end>  NO SATISFIED  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THIS ITEM. DEFINITELY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. THE PICTURE MAKES IT LOOK SO BIG AND THICK BUT WHEN I GOT IT HOME IT WAS A VERY SMALL EARING DEF. NOT WORTH $60. <end>  They are what they are but Amazon didn't show what they are...  These are tiny, tiny earrings. Yes, the photo shows the measurements, but it is so extremely magnified that you don't realize they are half-an-inch EACH...and that's not big at all. The photo must be at least 5x larger than actuality. Other than that, they're pretty, but way too small. I was buying these for my grandmother, but had to rush to get her something else once I received these. I will definitely be more careful when buying jewelry online! <end>  bought these same earrings for $10 less last week  I purchased these same earrings from Amazon last week for $10 less. What is going on Amazon? Why did the price jump up $10? <end>  Very nice earrings  I treated myself to a pair of these last week after having admired them over the last few months. I was not disappointed when they arrived. Classy looking and the quality is quite remarkable. <end>  Great all occasion earrings!  Just like the other reviews I am very satisfied with thisPurchase. These earrings are great for every day, night event, travel, etc.With these there is no need for me to take several pairs when traveling.The only reason I don't give a five star rating is due to the color is not as yellow as I would have like it. However, they don't look cheap at all. <end>  Classic -Love them  I wear them almost everyday. They are a very classic style and not a great big hoop that falls out of style as soon as you buy them. When I first bought them I thought they might be a little to small but after I put them on they were just right. <end>  Beautiful earrings  These earrings are stunning. I've worn them day and night which I could never do with any other earring this size. They look great, feel good and are more than worth the price I paid. I have diamonds, pearls and other precious stone earrings and these are a great addition to my jewelry collection. I will be buying more Duragold jewelry. <end>  Pretty (LITTLE) Earrings  Purchased for my mothers birthday. They are pretty little hoops. Little being the key word. They are small but if you don't like bigger earrings then they will be plenty big enough for you. The polished gold is pretty and mom says they are very comfortable earrings. If Mom likes them then they are okay with me! <end>  Nice earrings!  I read through the previous reviews before deciding to purchase these earrings. I am pleased with them, and think that I made a good decision. They are small -- as other reviewers have noted -- but that is what I wanted and the dimensions are reported accurately on the product page. They are also lightweight, which I believe to be a positive attribute. Overall, I find them to be a very nice, simple earring that gives a very classic look and is of very nice quality. <end>  Beautiful but a little small  These earrings are very nice, the color and feel are great. these would have been perfect if they were a bit bigger. <end>  Quality Light Weight Earrings  I bought this earrings as present for my wife. The item arrived on time but the pachaging was too cheap that I had to buy another box & gift wrapping.My wife loves this earrings and she keeps wearing it all time (at least for now).Earring size is good & the latch is excellent but you need to consider the light wieght issue before you buy. <end>  Love them!  I absolutely love these earrings. They are just what I wanted. I had some like them but had lost them so I was so pleased when I saw these on Amazon. I liked them so much I ordered some for Mom for Mother's Day. She loves them too. <end>  classics, classy hoops  The color, shape and gloss of these classic earrings make them perfect for almost every occasion. Earrings that will never go out of style and which cane be worn for years. <end>  novato mom  The earrings are very good quality. They are a great value pricewise and are exsctly like they look in the ad. I would purchase them again if the occasion was right (i.e., a gift for someone special). <end>  great for everyday wear  Price was right, size is fine (small, but I am a large adult and they are fine on my ear lobes!) I have been wearing nearly every day. <end>  Surprised by quality  I love 'em. Thought at the price they would look "cheap," but not so. Very pleased. <end>  very pretty and elegant earrings  they are beautiful, the earrings have very good brightness and are spectacular and precious. The salesman and the page of amazon are very responsible, I recommend it with the closed eyes.Thanks you... <end>  14k Yellow Gold Half Round Hoop Earrings  I bought these earrings for my 10-year old grandaughter for Christmas. I think she has worn them everyday since - she loves them. They are not large hoops; if fact, they are a bit small -- but perfect for her. For an adult, I think a little bit larger size would be better. All in all, I was very pleased with the earrings; the quality is very good. <end>  VERY FLIMSY  SORRY TO SAY THEY WERE A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WITH GOLD THESE DAYS. <end>  Surprise  Looked great in the picture. When they arrived I was surprised at the size (tiny) They did not fit when I tried them on and could not latch them since they did not fit my earlobe. They would be good for an infant. <end>  Great gift  My wife loves these. Exactly what she wanted and it made a great valentine's day gift. I am glad I got it. <end>  Good Product  Purchased these small hoops during special on Super Bowl Sunday. Glad I got them $10 off as they are small....which was noted by other reviewers. They are solidly made and look like they cost more than I paid. I am certain I will get lots of wear from them. <end>  Love them  I have been looking all over the internet to find a small gold hoop earrings, I saw these and read the reviews, some of the reviews stated that they were real small, so I kept looking around, but I kept coming back to this pair, so I decided to give them a try, besides if I did't like them I could always send them back,. I ordered them, and they were shipped in less than a week, and when I recieved them, exactlly what I was hoping for.I love them, as some of the other reviews stated. they are comfortable to wear day in, day out. Perfect for everyday wear. they are about 1/8 in diameter small than a dime, (they are not a huggie earrings) but has a nice thickness to them about 1/4&#34;. As I mention before a PERFECT everyday earring. If you are looking for a everyday pair of small earrings, these at it. <end>  What I expected  For the price, these are very nice and good for everyday wear. Will be giving these as a Valentine gift to my Mom. <end>  Too small, the size of pencil eraser!  They are tiny, not at all what expected! Poor quality,size for the price was a joke of an order, lesson learned! <end>  Lovely, one step up from studs, these are well made  They are a great work earring. Small, yet wide enough to signal they're there. Don't brush out on a hurried morning. Exactly what I was looking for. Well made. Good quality. <end>  Not much gold there  I've purchased a lot of earrings for my wife, and she likes very simple and small ones that she can wear all the time -- sleeping, yoga, running, etc. These are small diameter, which is fine, but they are not solid gold. They appear to be plated and really feel like plastic. When I first held them in my hand, I couldn't feel any weight at all, and I would be embarrassed to give them as a gift.I returned these earrings, and Amazon was great, as usual, about the free shipping and quick credit. I ended up buying a different pair from a local jeweler. They were even smaller hoops, but because they were solid gold, they felt like something substantial. <end>  Small but Very Comfortable  I bought these for myself as a Christmas gift. I really wanted just standard Gold hoops of good quality. The Pros are that these are extremely light and comfortable to wear. You won't even notice you have them on. The cons are that they are so small, you'll only want to wear them when you are at work or dressed comfortably over the weekend. If you're like me, they won't be a go-to for an evening out bcause their size makes them look too casual. <end>  Girlfriend Loved them!  I surprised her on Christmas Morning with these petite beauties. She was looking for a little splash of color that could be worn comfortably all the time. At the time of this review she has been wearing them non-stop, slept and even showered with them. I would recommend them, if these are the type of earrings your partner likes. <end>  just the right size  I was looking for a pair of small gold hoop earrings - these are great.I would recommend these to anyone.Item was shipped and arrived on time for Christmas <end>  Very Attractive Hoop Earrings  These earrings were part of my Christmas persent for my wife. They are quite petite, but so is my wife. She wears her hair in a pixie cut, so between her small stature and short hair, these hoops are perfect. They have a nice shine and a substantial width, both of which allow them to be tastefully noticeable. It's too early to know how sturdy they will be, but they seem fine. My wife loves them! We both recommend purchasing them. <end>  Very Nice, Elegant, and Light Weight  I may not be the best judge of jewelry, but my wife liked them very much as a Christmas gift (and she is forthright enough to let me know if she didn't). They are elegant in their simplicity, and very lightweight. Although they are the perfect size for my wife, they are probably smaller than you would expect, so I would suggest checking the size carefully before ordering. The clasp secures the rod tightly so I doubt they would be likely to fall off. <end>  Love love love!  I bought these last year. As soon as I got them, I put them on right away and I haven't taken them off since! these are the only earrings I've ever had that has not irritated my ears even once. They are comfortable, light, and pretty! I'll never buy any other earrings that are not from Duragold again! I went and got some two ball studs for my second ear hole too  ) <end>  Good deal  These earrings are not as large as I had thought but they are a good size for work. The workmanship is good and they look good on. They do not pull my earlobes down. I would recommend this purchase to everyone. <end>  Perfectly sized and very comfortable  I have been looking for a pair of small gold hoops for quite some time and these are exactly what I have been looking for. I wanted something small in size but with a bolder look. They are small and lightweight which makes them very comfortable to wear. They are perfect for women with short hair; they are small but not too small to be seen. <end>  Feel more substantial than expected  I bought these during a sale and got them for just under $50. I plan to use them as a birthday gift. They are just the right size. I wish I could have them for myself! I expected they would be flimsy, but they don't seem to be at all. Highly recommend especially when on sale. <end>  Attractive little hoops!  I wear mine for weeks at a time and forget I have them on. They are high quality and very attractive hoop earrings, but much smaller than I had imagined. They are keepers and the price was right! <end>  Perfect earrings for everyday  These gold earrings are perfect for everyday and can be worn out at night. They are lightweight enough not to tug at your ear and the closure is nice and tight so no chance of coming loose easily. They are small, but not too small as to not be noticeable. I found them to be the exact size I had imagined they would be according to the picture provided. <end>  Absolutely Perfect!  These little earrings were exactly what I wanted for work (to wear with scrubs and not look gaudy). They are small, but have a nice width, so they are very shiny. I also like the snap-bar closure. They'd make a nice gift for a pre-teen as they are simple but elegant and the snap bar closure makes them easy to put in with little chance of loss. <end>  Fair price and good product.  I got what I expected from these earrings. Although, I was hoping Amazon would be a little more competatively priced. <end>  Very Nice  I ordered these earrings for my Mom and when I saw them I thought wow, they are pretty small but on the ear they look great. A really nice choice for a simple but great quality pair of earrings. <end>  Tiny BUT darling hoops....  I love these little hoops!! Even though, I'd read all the reviews about how tiny they are, I don't think I was quite prepared... they are indeed TINY, but wide with a great finish .... perfect for everyday.... !!! They shipped quickly, I got them earlier than expected and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these ... <end>  Light and Lovely  If you scan some of the reviews about these earrings you'd think a magnifying glass should come with every pair so you could find them. Nothing could be further from the truth. They're smaller than, say, a wedding band but there's nothing flimsy or insubstantial about these lovely gold hoops.One reviewer said she loved that she could sleep in them quite comfortably, so I tried it for myself and found out that she was right. That's handy for me when I'm traveling because I'd really rather not take off my jewelry and risk losing it in the confusion of rushing from place to place.I don't recall anyone mentioning the finish, but it is exceptionally attractive and shows no sign of losing its luster after weeks of wear in all sorts of conditions. Beautiful earrings at a beautiful price. <end>  CHEAP LOOKING AND VERY VERY SMALL  i WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE AND APPEARANCE OF THESE EARRINGS.I ORDERED A FEW ITEMS FROM AMAZON FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS AND WAS DISAPPOINTED IN ALL OF THEM <end>  Rip off  I am long time Amozon customer and this is the first time I feel flat out ripped off. These earrings are tiny - not small - tiny. When the package first arrived, I truly thought that they forgot to ship the earrings. I couldn't find them in the pouch they were sent in. <end>  great buy  They are light in weight, nice everyday size, I am wearing them all the time. I like them so much, I ordered another pair for my daughter. <end>  Duragold small hoop earings  Very nice quality. Lightweight so they don't pull down the ear lobes. High polish. I have been looking for jus this size hoop earing. <end>  I love  I love my wife, they look good, by the way are echos in Dominican Republic.They are elegant, be looking good. <end>  Beautiful!  Just received my earrings and they are beautiful and appear to be excellent quality gold. They are small as indicated in the product description but a bright gold that reflects the light nicely so they do not disappear like other small earrings. They are perfect for every day use. I was looking for earrings that I could wear during my morning work out and not have to change when I changed into my office clothes. These are exactly right! I love them! <end>  Wife loved the earrings.  My wife likes small hoop earrings to go with her two diamond stud earrings. She loved how small these were and found the quality really good. <end>  keeping but would not recommend  It may be my mistake that I did not see the size, but width was fine but size of hoop was tiny. <end>  Beautiful Earrings  I expected larger earrings but they were so small so i gave them to my granddauther fir her baptism gift! Love the earrings, and quality! My granddaughter will keep them forever. <end>  Too small  I bought these earrings thinking they would be the same size as a normal wedding band. But they ended up being too "fat" and too small in diameter. The quality is good though, and the packaging and box were impecable. <end>  I like them!  The earrings look exactly like the picture. Some reviews said they are small but I like the size, very suitable for daily wear. In fact, when I received them 3 weeks ago I had been wearing them since then, never take them off. I have very sensitive ears and ALL my earrings cause irritation but not this ones - I'm impressed! And yes, you don't really feel them when you wear them to sleep. I paid 102 and IMO this is worthwhile. I'm looking for bigger hoop now in Amazon but have not set my eyes on ones yet. <end>  Great everyday basics  They're a great basic earring. I did my usual trick and bought two pair so I can lose one and continue wearing them. <end>  Earring Size  The photo showing these earrings indicated 1 inch (I assumed in diameter) but apparently I mistook this after looking again at the diagram.. My mistake!! They are only 1/2" in diameter - and that is NOT what I wanted. So I will return them for credit to my account. They are beautiful but just too small, and I will look for a larger size. <end>  Beautiful and Tasteful  These are precisely what I was hoping they would be. They are classy and classic--exactly the type of every day hoops a lady would wear. They are hollow and not gold-filled, so beware if that's what you're looking for, though I don't know why you'd want that since that would just make them heavy and lead to old lady ear droop. Exactly what I was looking for! <end>  Nice, but quite small  These are nice earrings, but they are WAY smaller than I expected and I did actually measure before making the purchase. They are about the size of a dime. They are good every day earrings, but if you are expecting larger hoops, these are not them. <end>  Oops!  I got it wrong! Despite my,I thought, correct sizing, these ear rings are about half the size I wanted. They are very nice, but very small, more the size of a dime than quarter. I was trying to replace a set I'd gotten at Amazon and loved. Now I'll need to try again. Measure twice, cut once! <end>  She loved 'em!  Got these for my wife and they are perfect. Nice quality and she can wear them with casual dress or dressing up even nicer. <end>  Classic  These earrings are terrific! They are classically attractive and very, very comfortable. I'm in my 50's and don't like heavy earrings anymore. These are very light weight. I've forgotten to take them out and slept in them with no problems at all. I will buy Duragold products in the future. <end>  Just too small  There's nothing wrong with the quality of these earrings. They are well-made and arrived nicely packaged. But they are very small. Just a bit larger than 1/2". And I misread the measurements thinking the were 7/8" rather than .7 which is a big difference.One thing that I found misleading and may have contributed to my error is the pricing. There are similar earrings at 50% of the price these go for. So it makes sense if you expect pricing to be proportional and don't take other factors into account. For example these earrings may be heavier and larger and perhaps the price of gold makes even small differences large in terms of pricing.But bottom line  pretty as these earrings are they appear small and flimsy -- like something you'd buy at a super discount store. I'd rather buy a nice, substantive pair of earrings made by a quality costume jewelry brand like Kenneth Jay Lane. But to each their own.These are going back  ( <end>  Small, but noticable and elegant  I just received these earrings, and I absolutely love them! They are small yet noticable and elegant. Perfect for me! <end>  Love these earrings!  I wanted a pair of smaller gold earrings for every day wear. These are perfect.The hoop is small, but makes a nice impression on the ear. I have forgotten I have them on and have worn them to bed, which is something I never do with earrings. If you want a smaller size hoop that is noticable on the ear and not overpowering, these are perfect. <end>
 B0000B35F9  14k Yellow Gold 1.9mm Franco Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  Very Nice  This is a very nice necklace. Only drawback is the clasp. It's a bit hard to work. Otherwise ver nice. <end>
 B0000B35FI  14k Yellow and White Gold Wrapped Snake Chain Bracelet, 7" ||	  Nice  The yellow gold was darker than I had anticipated, but still a very nice piece. Good weight. <end>
 B0000B35GE  Duragold 14k White Gold Hoop Earrings, (0.80" Diameter) ||	  Very pretty  Very smooth, shiny and pretty. They look very nice and are perfect for work or just casual wear. <end>  Nice for the price!  Good value, nice looking. I was pleasantly surprised given that it's difficult to tell whether the product that is displayed is often going to be as nice when it's finally delivered. <end>  Expected solid not hollow  These hoops look as they were photographed. I have had earrings with the unusual stem shape before so they don't bother me at all. I have sensitive ears and the purity of the metal is just what I needed. No itching or irritation after a week of wearing them. They arrived nicely packaged and would make a nice gift. I was surprised however to find that these earrings are hollow. For the price I expected a solid metal with some weight behind it. The fact that they are hollow gives them a 'cheap' feel in your hand. <end>  Post too big..OUCH  These earrings are very pretty, but the post is WAY TOO THICK. They killed my ears and I had to return them. I would guess the post is at least 2.5 times as thick as a normal post, and my ears did not like it!!! <end>  Great Earrings!  I love these earrings! As others have posted they are about the size of a nickel and with them being a little thicker (3mm) I find that they are a perfect size. Although they are a thicker hoop they are so light that I do not even know I am wearing them most of the time. I did not have any issues like some others have had with the thicker posts inserting and wearing them during the day. I did however have a bit of a hard time sleeping with them on. I was beginning to think that I would need to take them out before going to sleep however after about 3 sleeps I now have no issues with them at all and leave them in all the time. They appear to be really high quality earrings that are built to last. Shipping was extremely fast and I am very happy with them. Hope this review helps. <end>  Not worth the money  I was very disappointed in these earrings. They were only about the size of a nickel, and for $50 I expected them to be as large as earrings I have found from several other merchants for the same price. If you are looking for average size hoops -- say the size of a quarter -- these are NOT the earrings for you. I can only imagine how tiny the $30 pair is. <end>  A decent pair of earrings...  I actually bought these earrings for myself. I noticed a number of women complaining about the "oddly shaped" post that goes through the ear causing them discomfort. I didn't have any problems, however, I've had large gage earrings in my ears before. For a guy, they are slightly bigger than I would normally like. But, fortunately, because of my style and look, I'm able to wear them well. I've bought other gold earrings for this same price that weigh "half" the grams these do, so I'm not sure why people are saying they expected them to be heavier and less expensive. The size of these earrings are exactly that of the size of a nickel. So if your a guy and your not sure, put a nickel up to your ear to get an idea of how big it is. Well worth the price. I paid a good price for a good quality earring and gram weight. You won't be dissapointed! <end>  Hurts my ears  The actual prong that goes into your ear is not round but flat and oddly shaped, so whenever I put these earring in they hurt my ears. So I've only been able to wear them twice and the second time I had to take them out because they became so painful. <end>  Best 14k White Gold Hoops around!  I love these earrings, they have a true white gold luster that is unmistakable. They are about the size of a nickle, which is a perfect size, and the tubes are a substantial diameter-YOU SEE THESE EARRINGS when you wear them. It is true the posts are a bit larger than what I was accustom to, but if you insert them with care, and don't just jam them in your ear, they are fine, REALLY! The first time I wore them I just wanted to pop them in and go, and it did hurt...a couple of days later, I tried again, inserting them carefully and slower, and haven't had any problems whatsoever. One of the best purchases I have ever made, I do recommed them to anyone. <end>  Excellent hoops!  This product was far superior than what I expected it to be. I wear them multiple times throughout the week both to work and social functions.The one thing I would recommend to potential buyers is wait for this to go on sale, as you can get these earrings for about 50% off. <end>  Great Earrings  I am very pleased with my new earrings. These are just the right size for me and goes well with every outfit. <end>  Very good quality.  I bought these to replace my boyfriend's favorite earrings (he lost one). I had to return them because they were a little bigger than the one's he had and they looked a bit "metro". Overall, though, they were of excellent quality and I wish it had worked out. <end>  Rather nice really  It's lighter than I thought, looked like stainless steel to my man eyes, but my wife loved it and it is great for everyday use, so there. <end>  Great earrings for a great price!  These are exactly like the picture shows and are sturdy and simple - exactly what I was looking for. The clasp on one earring was a little tight fitting, but it loosened up after a few open and close motions -- I'd rather it be too tight than too loose and risk having the earring fall out.They are a great size - not too big and flashy, but as I said simple and clean. I wear them all the time now -- really pleased with them! <end>  Beautiful earrings  These earrings are an excellent value for the cost. They are a beautiful finish and much lighter than I expected from white gold. They are very comfortable to wear and unlike some other reviewers, I had no trouble with discomfort from the posts and I have very newly pierced ears, less than 6 months. The posts are slightly wider than an average pair of earrings and a somewhat unique shape, but I had no troubles wearing these. They hoops are slightly larger than I'd expected, but still a very nice and a very elegant and classical style. <end>  outstanding purchase  I got these today and was so shocked when they arrived, wow, these are amazing hoops for 25 dollars. I am more than pleased, don't have an idea what some of the other reviewers were complaining about, I am floored at the price and the quality at the same time. With free shipping these are a must, great gift idea and everyday earrings. Amazon got them to me in a matter of 4 days and I'm in Hawaii, they also came beautifully packaged, I'm in love with them, don't let these sell out! <end>  Perfect Hoops  I love these hoops, they are a great everyday earring. Well made and good looking. I wear mine several days a week and have had them for over 3 years now. <end>  Not too shabby for a one periced ear guy!  Not only is it simple enough a style for a guy, but its the perfect size to be a respectable pirate earring (I am a Will Turner >.>). While it is pure gold, it is quite hollow, which I suppose could be considered a Plus. I sleep shower and everything else with this earing on, so you can too ;)If you want a simple "pirate like" earing that you don't have to worry at all about, then buy this. This one is the right size (sadly this is not the first one on Amazon I tried). <end>  Pretty but small  I expected larger hoops but my sister said they reminded her of what we used to wear when we were younger. They were a gift so I was hoping for better. Pricey for the size. <end>  white gold hoops  The earrings are just right for everyday wear and the quality f0r the price excellant. <end>  Bought them for a friend's birthday.  I bought the earrings for a friend's birthday, I gave them to her just last Friday and she said she loves the earrings. So, I'm happy about that... <end>  My Girlfriend liked them...  These were perfect, the girl liked them, they're the perfect size, not very expensive, great gift! <end>  simplicity at it's finest  The weight of these are perfect and the clasps feel very secure. Nothing like the classic white gold hoop earrings. <end>  Great Buy!!!  My wife is a flight attendant who wanted something simple but nice...I ordered these because the description sounded very nice. To my surprise they were very nice...beautiful, shiney, nice weight without ripping her ear off, she loved them!!! As far as the seller, they were awesome, I ordered them on Dec 22th, they arrived with free two day shipping on the Dec 24th as stated. Nothing but praise for the item and the shipper. <end>  Wife loves them!  Bought as Christmas present. Came in the mail fast and wife loves them. Very pretty earrings at a greatprice! <end>  a bit too small  The quality is very good, but the size is misleading. I suggest a picture of the earring on a model. <end>  Duragold 14k White Gold Hoop Earrings, (.80" Diameter)  We love the ear rings. The only problem is they're not large enough. We would like the same ear ring "hoop" in at least a 1" size. I'm guessing these to be about 3/4" in size. Please let me know if it's possible to get these in a 1" size. We'll be more than happy to pay whatever the increase is. Exactly the same Hoop but in a 1" size. Duragold 14k White Gold Hoop Earrings, (0.80" Diameter) Thanks wayne hall <end>  Very Nice  Very nice set as promised. Very pretty on the ear and just right for daily wear in the first hole. Classy shine! <end>  LOVELY!  Made my girlfriend VERY HAPPY! In fact she worn them, after receiving, for two months straight! Which is A PROOF -)) Great gift and for this price? Just GREAT! <end>  14K white gold hoops  Very nice look and weight. Simple enough for every day wear, but substantial enough to get noticed. <end>  Classy  These were a gift (got to love the wish list). I am very satisfied with the quality, weight, appearance of the earrings. I wear them often. <end>  Want another pair  I bought these for my daughter and they are so nice I want a pair too! <end>  perfect earrings for everyday use  I bought these earrings half a year ago and use it almost every day to work, they're sturdy and go well with most outfits. They're low maintenance as I haven't needed to bring out the jewelry cleaner for it, but they're still shiny anyway. <end>  white gold hoop earrings  These earrings were just what I was looking for. They were impossible to find in a store, so I was delighted to locate them on Amazon. <end>  Great  I really like these earrings. They are small and cute. I wear them every day and have not had a problem. Nice and sturdy as well. <end>  Good product  I was nervous when i bought these for my girlfriend however, they proved to be perfect. Good quality and they are not huge rings at all just small and cute. <end>  Quality earrings for the price  This was a pity gift to myself because it was my anniversary, and I've just had nose surgery. Like other reviewers, I was also surprised at the quality of these earrings. I try to look for bargains on Amazon to make my shopping dollars go as far as possible, and these seemed to be a good deal at $24.99 when regular price was $75. Just since March 16, though, both retail and selling prices have changed on Amazon to be $34.99 and $70. It's very true that the posts are a little thicker than normal, but not onerously so; the result is that the hoop is not going to slide around on your ear, and the post clicks securely into the catch on the other side. The earrings are larger than I expected for the price, which is good, but they are not too big. Nickel size is about right, and they feel as if they have some weight to them. <end>  Sturdy, well made, and simply beautiful  I think the title says it all! The posts are fine and I don't feel that they are too thick at all. These earrings are comfortable and elegant. In response to the two negative reviews based on the size of the hoops, I would recommend that all intelligent buyers READ the dimensions in order to avoid disappointment. I can't believe that people would negatively rate an item because they were ignorant and failed to read the description. The description is very accurate and I am very happy with these earrings. You won't be disappointed with the quality of these earrings. <end>  Lovely  Beautiful, shiny, sturdy and well constructed, and are thicker and look more solid than I expected. I'm very pleased. <end>  Posts too thick, not comfortable  These earrings were very uncomfortable. I'm not sure if it's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle--more like an angled bar than a round post. I don't have particularly sensitive ears, although I generally don't wear large or heavy jewelry, either. These earrings are on their way back to Amazon.I also wasn't thrilled to see how much the price has varied. When I ordered--4/6/07--they were $34.99. Some reviewers bought them for less, yet the current price seems to be even more.Caveat Emptor <end>  You get what you pay for  I sent these for my cousin (who has everything!)on her 16th Birthday. When i saw them later they were smaller than I expected----but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated. They are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones. Plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold--I would recommend these. <end>  White Gold Hoop Earrings  I am very happy with the earrings.Good Quality, pretty and they came in a timely matter. <end>  14k White Gold Hoop Earrings  These are very nice, great for a basic pair of earrings. Very nice size and I believe these will be great for very day wear. <end>  Very Nice Earrings  I was almost scared to order these earrings online because I wasn't sure of the size. I do not like really big hoop earrings and I thought these would be too big when I received them. They came in today and they are very nice. Just the perfect size for me and I am very pleased.I would also like to add that I got the free shipping because they were over 25 bucks and I still received them fast. They were also packaged very nicely. I would definately recommend these earrings to anyone who likes white gold. <end>  Great (little) hoops for $20  Yes, these are slightly on the small side, but as another reviewer noted, the description tells you how many mm the diameter is. I picked these up with a great price and like others, have NOT found the "post" to be too thick at all. It's not a circular type post, it's like flattened.But really, fantastic little white gold hoops, in your hand, you can feel the weight of them and know that they're gold without being too heavy in your ears. <end>  Perfect !  These earrings are perfect for everyday!The post is the kind I look for it's a sign of quality.These are a perfect size for anyone to wear anytime. <end>  &#34;I like these a lot&#34; she said.  Pre holiday gift for my wife. She likes them a lot and because they are white gold, she can leave them on all the time. Clasp is easy to use an sturdy. They look great. <end>  High Quality Earrings  These earrings are beautiful! A great size for any woman and at an affordable price. I received them very quick and although I have never purchased jewelry online before, they exceeded my expectations. <end>  Love It  I've been really happy with the earing. Quality is great I would love them in a bigger size. Great purchase!! <end>  Very Nice  Beautiful packaging, velvet box inside another box and more than I expected. These are sturdy earrings with a beautiful finish. A note - the post for these is a bit larger than average. <end>  Wear these everyday  These are the most comfortable earring to wear and look graet with everything.They are my go to pair each day!Very simple yet very classy! <end>  Perfect  These are shiny (but not fake shiny) and the perfect size for wearing with everything. I was looking for a durable pair of white gold hoops. I also like how sturdy they are and that the posts clicks in so that I don't worry about losing one. <end>  Closure problem and very uncomfortable  All I wanted was a pair of hoop earring, yellow or white gold. I've worn this style as every day earrings for years and managed to lose one. These looked perfect and in spite of the outrageous increase of the price of gold, I decided to order them. The size was exactly as described and would have indeed been perfect except for the following  the part that goes into the piercing is not the usual wire. Instead it is a thin flat piece of gold that is significantly wider in diameter than a wire and was terribly uncomfortable. If you are a person with stretched out piercings, this may not bother you, but it was a deal breaker for me. The second problem is that earrings like this must have a good closure. ONE of them had a very tight closure- almost too tight but I could have lived with that. The other was so loose that it would have definitely come unhooked and I would have lost it. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed. If you are a person who is used to wearing larger diameter earrings, I would say this could be a good deal if you get a pair with decent closures. They're beautiful and shiny and an excellent size. But if you're like I am and thick earrings hurt you, look for ones with wire style clasp backs. <end>  Very Pretty!  Wanted a light-weight earring, w/out the separate back slip-on.I can actually sleep in these, w/out any pain! Bad me, I had worn a cheapie pair of earrings to a family function, and paid for it w/puffy lobes.Great buy! <end>  Duragold 14k White Gold Hoop Earrings  I've been looking for a pair of medium size white gold hoop earrings for sometime. When I purchased my I-Phone I decided to purchase a pair from Amazon. I am extremely pleased with the quality of these earrings and I would highly recommend them to other customers! <end>  Should Real Gold Feel Like Plastic? Not Worth the Price.  Perhaps, my expectations of $140.00 pair of earrings are too high. I love the look of these earrings and dropped some not-so-subtle hints to my husband that they would make a great Mother's Day gift. He picked up on the hints and presented me with the earrings this morning. I was pleased to see them sitting pretty in the box. Then, I took them out and I immediately told him they would have to go back. As another review mentioned, they must be hollow (or plastic?). My first reaction was that he was ripped off because the earrings really do feel like they are plastic. I told him to feel them (without expressing my concerns about the authenticity of the gold) and he immediately said they felt like plastic too. I haven't even bothered to try them on because they feel far more cheap than what I expect for this price. I'm not sure it matters, but there is no karat marking on the earrings either. I know that doesn't mean they are definitely fake, but the absence of the marking certainly adds to my reservations. <end>
 B0000BUWI8  14k White Gold Rope Chain Bracelet, 8" ||	  Could have been better  This 8" bracelet is 7.8" in length. And this 3mm wide bracelet is under 3mm, approximately 2.85mm in width. This shaving of size to save a little cost in gold is not an honest way of transacting a sale. A $75 gold bracelet should be the full length of 8" and width of 3mm as described. I may return it or purchase a larger clasp. The one that came with it was diminutive in the extreme. But for this price I shouldn't have to. <end>
 B0000BUWM0  14k Yellow Gold Filigree Angel Charm ||	  Very Delicate Pendant!  This pendant is awesome. It looks good on the website but wait until you see it! The pendant is very delicate looking and very pretty. I bought 2 1 for my mom and 1 for my mother in law, I can't wait to give them as presents! =) <end>
 B0000BUWMU  14k Yellow Gold Polished Diamond-Cut Dome Swirl Earrings ||	  Review on jewelry  These earrings are great!! Not heavy, tho they look like they would be. You'll forget they're there!! <end>  Very nice!  Very pretty and not heavy. Better than I even expected! <end>
 B0000BUWN7  14k Yellow Gold Dangle Stick Earrings ||	  Very nice  It wasn't as long as I expected, but really nice for the price. They dangle nicely, and more then met my expectations. <end>  Gold Dangle Stick Earrings  These earrings are wonderful. Very comfortable to wear and well worth the price. I recommend them to anyone who loves gold. M. in Tucson, AZ <end>
 B0000BUWSG  14k Yellow and Rose Gold Diamond-cut Oval Filigree Rose Charm ||	  Nice piece!  I ordered this as a thank you gift for my matron of honor. Roses were my theme. I too was pleasantly surprised at the fine quality of the charm. She loved it. If more are placed in stock, I may be back! <end>  s. wilkins  This charm is just lovely. Very feminine. The quality is better than I had expected. It doesn't have that inexpensive "pressed" look with edge irregularities. The 14k gold is a nice warm, not orange or whitish color - doesn't look cheap at all, which was a concern I had when ordering. (It is stamped 14k) The filligree gives it a beautiful sparkling quality. The detail on the miniature rose is quite good nestled by its ring of tiny shimmering leaves. The actual size is about 1" including top ring. I recommend a very delicate chain to go with it. Beautiful little charm. I am very pleased with it. Arrived within one week with basic shipping. <end>
 B0000BUWSI  14k Yellow Gold Oval Cross w/ Rope Border Charm ||	  Grandma loved it!  It was bigger than I thought it would be, it was a nice size.Very pretty, grandma loved it. <end>
 B0000BUWUV  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-cut Lock and Key Theme Charm ||	  My husband gave me this and  I love it. It is just the right size for most of my other charms to go with. Very beautiful. I love the multible charms that are linked. <end>

 B0000BUX14  14k Yellow Gold 2004 Cap and Tassel Charm ||	  Class Pride!  I couldn't help but purchase this since it was fairly cheap and it wasn't difficult to find a chain for it in my area since summer sales were all over the place. I love it and while I don't wear it all the time, I wear it when I can. <end>
 B0000BUX3W  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-Cut Heart Charm ||	  Diamantino  Este producto tiene un efecto diamantino lo cual lo hace agradable a la vista. Es ligero y muy bonito. <end>
 B0000BUX7F  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-cut Italian Horn Charm ||	  Gorgeous!  This gold Horn is more beautiful than I can say. It has a lovely sparkle to it and is just stunning. If you want a special piece this is it! Very well made and strong. <end>
 B0000BUXA0  14k Yellow Gold Sisters Charm ||	  recommend seller  This item was just what I was looking for and it came is most timely fashion. I would do business again with this seller if the need arises. <end>  gold sisters charm  This was exactly what I was looking for. My mom had bought one for my sister and I 8 years ago. Upon her sudden death a few months ago, I wanted my younger sister to have the same exact one we shared. I found it here for a great price. It brought tears to our eyes. Thank you so much for making this a convienant purchase. <end>  Perfect Sentiment  My adopted 2 y.o. daughter has a 10 y.o. 1/2 biological sister whom she met for the first time recently. I got this heart pendant for the two of them to commemorate their meeting and their special bond. I put a ribbon on both charms and put it over both their heads before having them break the heart apart so that they each wore a half. Though they live far apart and may not see each other for years, I know they will both treasure this pendant and their bond forever. <end>
 B0000BUXA2  14k Yellow Gold "For the One I Love" Charm ||	  It is Worth It's Weight in Gold  This is a beautiful heart. If a man is looking for something reasonable and extremeley special for Valentine's Day...look no further. Your wife or girlfriend will (if she loves gold) be pleased with this charm. Women will envy her when she wears it especially when she tells them that her significant other gifted her with it. <end>
 B0000BUXA5  14k Yellow Gold Mother Daughter Charm ||	  from Green Bay, WI  My husband bought this as a gift for myself and my 5 year old. Good value for the price. It was a bit smaller then I expected.... but it is only $20 - it was not a huge investment. I wish it was offered with a chain (even for a higher price) <end>  Buy it, it is very nice but....  I love the concept of this item. I gave half to my daughter and she put it on a chain and it was so nice. The only thing I don't like is that I wish it were a little bigger or thicker, i.e. more substantial. I understand that the cost is less if it is thinner, but I would rather pay a little more for it to be a little bigger or thicker, since this is so beautiful and will last a long time. I would definitely recommend it in any case. <end>  wonderful piece of jewelry  I love this. I travel a fair amount and when I am gone my daughter and I each wear our piece of this. It is a great weight and good quality. A little bit bigger than a dime-fairly small but a good size. <end>
 B0000BUXA6  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-cut Dollar Sign Charm ||	  This was bigger than I expected  It was bigger than I expected but I would like it to have been even a little bigger. I think the description should have included the size. It looks nice on a simple chain over a black high necked knit blouse. <end>  dollar sign charm  Beutiful necklace for a good price. Fragile though, this is my second one, but I do have a 3 year old with a habit of tugging. <end>
 B0000BVET4  14k White Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Solitaire Earrings (3/4ctw, I-J, I1) ||	  Awesome!  The IGI certified diamonds I received were G-H Color - SI(2) Clarity - Good Cut - 0.71tw. Every specification exceeded the "minimum" specifications advertised.Not only am I very impressed that every single specification exceeded the minimums advertised; the price of $699 was very competitive. When I searched the internet, I could not find any other certified diamonds even close to this price. Most on-line retailers are charging more than $699 for 3/4tw un-certified diamonds.I will definitely buy jewelry from Amazon again. <end>
 B0000BVEY9  18k White Gold Princess Cut Diamond Stud Earrings (1/2ctw, H-I, SI2) ||	  What a surprise!  These earring were brilliant, sparkling, and bigger than I expected. The amazing thing was the earrings I received were certified two grades higher on both color and clarity, and were certified at three times the price I paid. <end>  Beautiful earrings, and I got them free!  These earrings are absolutely gorgeous, and I got them free in a special promotion at this web site  http //freetopstuff.com/jewelry <end>  Failed To Provide Diamond Grading Report As Advertised  I recieved my order and was extremely upset. As clearly indicated on the website I was to receive a Diamond grading report along with the earrings but it was never sent. I called customer service which has been outsourced to some developing country where english is definitely a second language and some person with only rudimentary English tried to help me but proved utterly useles. Finally called another number and got someone in Canada. He spoke English just fine so I can't complain about him. Unfortunately, in order to get th eGrading Report that was prmised from the start I have to send the entire package back in order for them to send me a whole new package whcich contains the earrings with the Grading Report. Of course, the item is now "currently out of stock" and nothing is available and meanwhile it's only two weeks 'till Christmas!! Seems like major BS if you ask me. They said I should go appraise this product myself at a local gemologist which means I' will incur additional costs of which Amazon is willing to cover a part of. LESSON LEARNED  DON'T BUY JEWELRY FROM AMAZON. I'm a member of a bunch of worldwide forums and internet groups and I will be ALL OVER THE PLACE making sure eas many people as possible will know my plight. <end>
 B0000BVF02  18k Yellow Gold Princess Cut Diamond Solitaire Earrings (1/4ctw, G-H, VS2) ||	  Amazing Buy  This is the first time I am buying diamonds from Amazon and I am totally amazed at the quality I got. I have bought diamond earrings of a much lower quality at a much higher price elsewhere. This is going to be my only place to shop for diamonds. Golden Buy. A+++++++++++++++ <end>
 B0000BVF1N  Platinum Princess Cut Diamond Solitaire Earrings (1/4ctw, G-H, VS2) ||	  Better than advertised  I purchased these earings as a gift to my wife for the holidays. She loves them. They are not large diamonds, but the quality makes up for it. I received the IGI certificate that states the two diamonds are larger and better in quality than advertised. I'm not sure if it was luck, but they look great and they are the right size for her to wear every day.Even though they are not large, I can definitely tell they are not costume diamonds. I can see them sparkle from across the room.My opinion on the platinum mounting and secure screw backs is that they are an absolute necessity for earings like these, the diamonds are not something you would want to lose. The diamonds are so colorless I feel a yellow gold mounting would detract from the white sparkle.I checked other mall retail jewelry sites begining with a &quot;Z&quot; and a &quot;K&quot; before going buying. Those stores offered lower quality for higher prices. I recommend these earings for the quality, the price, the 30 day return policy, and Amazon quality service as usual. <end>  Wow, these are unbelievable!  My wife has always wanted high quality diamond studs that had a certificate so I looked around the mall at all of the jewelry stores. After checking every store, I purchased a pair that were 1/3 ct were F in Color but only I1 in clarity (the saleswoman convinced me that the clarity was not that important), they were $500 dollars on sale. When I gave them to my wife she was very happy. My wife is always looking for the best price, so upon seeing the name of the jewelry store on the box and reading the diamond report, she asked me the price. She suggested I return them as they sounded too expensive for the clarity and were at the low range of a 1/3 carat weight. My wife said try Amazon since she had only heard great things about their prices and their quality.Received these today, WOW!! I was very lucky since the IGI Certificate states that they are better than listed and the Estimated Retail value is astonishing. They are absolutely beautiful and my wife is ecstatic.I will always buy my diamond jewelry from Amazon. <end>
 B0000BVGN5  14k White Gold Channel-set Princess Cut Diamond Band (1/2ctw, I, I1), Size 7 ||	  agutter  I shopped around at local businesses for the same ring. Most stores only sold an SI2, but they were about $800.00. This ring is worth the money, if you can not afford the higher quality. It does not look any different and is very pretty. I am using it as a wedding band next to my higher quality engagement ring and the diamonds look the same. I had it verbally appraised and the dealer said he would think it was worth about $500.00. <end>
 B0000BXG1U  Sterling Silver Diamond Accented I.D. Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  SMALL  Should have specified that the size was appropriate for a child or teenager not a grown adult! <end>
 B0000BXG20  Sterling Silver Rectangular Identification Bangle Bracelet w/ Diamond Accent ||	  High Quality!  This bracelet features high quality sterling silver! It is perfect for engraving and suitable for just about all ages.No worries about it bending out of shape. This thing takes a good amount of strength to hook and can stand up to the roughness of teenagers.I liked it so much that I bought another. <end>
 B0000BXG25  Sterling Silver Concave Cuff Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Sleek bracelet and a great value!  This sleek little bracelet is the perfect addition to any jewelry collection featuring silver. It's gorgeous, and goes with anything! <end>  I wouldn't give this as a gift  This bracelet is way to plain and bland for gift giving. It looks unfinished. <end>  Lacking Flavor  This bracelet is way too boring. It looks like the designer ran out of ideas and then gave up. <end>  Product specifications  The bracelet looks beautiful and I am sure it is. I love sterling and white gold, BUT, I would like to see another important spec on the item....I would like to know the 'width' of the bracelet. It means alot to 'me', I don't like jewelry that is tooo big/wide, and I would prefer more than 1/16&quot; of a piece. I think it would be great to know the width of the piece also. Just my opinion. It could be possible that I did not notice the spec I was looking for to make up my mind.Thanks, Connie <end>
 B0000BY87O  14k Two-Tone Round 3-Stone Diamond Station Necklace (1/2ctw, I, I1) ||	  Beautiful  This is a lovely item - something you can put on an wear every day. I am very pleased with it. <end>
 B0000BY88C  18k White Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1 1/2ctw, H-I, SI2) ||	  A terrific surprise!  These earrings were a higher quality than advertised! I couldn't be happier. My husband bought these for me after we did extensive research on prices, color, clarity & size.The color was G instead of the advertised H-I. The clarity was SI2 with no visible inclusions (my husband looked at them under 3x magnification and saw only one small inclusion in one of the stones). They arrived very quickly and the box was a beautiful dark wood.Best of all was the price. We looked at lots of jewelry stores and similar earrings started at $5000.I never would have thought to buy expensive jewelry on-line. But I would check out amazon's collection and buy from them every time. <end>
 B0000BY88E  18k Yellow Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/4ctw, G-H, VS2) ||	  Satisfied purchase  Great product....Came as described...After this purchase, I was very satisfied with and I decided to buy diamonds from Amazon only <end>
 B0000BY88L  Platinum Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/4ctw, G-H, VS2) ||	  Gorgeous & practical...  I love these earrings! My husband gave them to me as a birthday gift (ok, so I helped pick them out). They are absolutely beautiful. The quality is excellent, and the size is perfect  elegant, but simple enough to wear every day. And while the screw-back does take some effort when putting the earrings on and taking them off, I don't mind because of the added security it provides. As such, I have no qualms about wearing them to bed or in the shower (e.g., if I happen to forget to take them out, or if I am worried about putting them in a safe place at the time). I don't find them at all uncomfortable. A lovely gift! <end>  Beautiful earrings, and I got them free!  These earrings are absolutely gorgeous, and I got them free in a special promotion at this web site  http //freetopstuff.com/jewelry <end>  Very uncomfortable  The screwback on these earrings is not for everyone. They are very uncomfortable and difficult to put on. The earrings are well made and the stones were beautiful, but unfortunately, while they were nice to look at, they were unwearable. <end>
 B0000BY88O  IGI Certified Platinum 4-Prong Diamond Stud Earrings (3/4 cttw, G-H Color, VS2 Clarity) ||	  Very nice quality diamonds  I purchased these earrings and I am excited about the quality but not the size. To be fair, I knew little about diamond studs until I did research on Amazon and learned a bunch over the course of a couple of weeks, but the one thing I wish I'd seen was pictures of diamond studs in "actual" size next to each other -i.e. not blown up on the screen to look pretty. The 1/4, the 1/3, the 1/2, the 3/4, and the 1 carat total weight pairs would have been nice to see all at once. Had I seen this I might have opted for the larger size (and perhaps slightly lower quality so as to afford it). Yes, you can print the helpful "actual size" report from Amazon, but this does not have any small sizes except for the 1/2 and 1 carat studs (and nothing in between).One more thing, the gemological report that I received was NOT as detailed as the "sample" on the website. There appears to be an actual photo of my diamonds on my report but you do NOT see the drawings that show flaws and occlusions. This would have been nice. Also, there are fewer descriptive terms in the ratings than I expected. For example, on my certificate it says "G-G/G-G" for Polish and Symmetry. Although it was bound and presented well, I had hoped for something more like the sample on the website.On the flip side, these diamonds are really high quality. I compared them to a coworkers larger studs and it was immediately apparent that these were colorless and clear (to my eyes) while the others were a bit cloudy and not as nice.The quality of the studs was as advertised. One stud was VS-1 and the other was VS-2 and the color for both was G-H. The Total Carat Weight was 0.72 (not the 0.75 as hoped for) but this was above the guaranteed minimum spec. of 0.70.The product was received very quickly, and was well packaged and presented. I would absolutely purchase this type of thing from Amazon again... <end>  Love my studs!  Just took delivery of these diamond stud earrings today (7/7/2004) and I am very very happy with them. First, the negative... but only a slight negative... I had to wait 2 and a half months for these  ( But it was well worth the wait. Amazon shipped them complimentary next day air. The diamonds I received were beautiful. [...] I would definitely recommend Amazon for diamonds. Now I don't have to trek all the way to Holland and Belgium for my diamonds. <end>  Exceptionally clear and beautiful diamonds  I purchased these earrings for Valentine's day when they were listed for $1800. I looked around and found it to be the best deal. The diamonds are of very high quality, very clear and brilliant. The only complain that I have is that Amazon did not send IGI certificate for these diamonds. When I contacted customer service, I was told that certificates are offered for diamonds above 1 carat only. Otherwise I am quite pleased with the purchase. <end>  everything I expected  The earrings were everything I expected. They have a brilliant sparkle and the screw mounts eliminate any worry about losing them.I bought them for my wife for our 40th anniversary and she loves them. We live way out in the country and when I ordered the over night shipping I never expected to see them the next day, but they arrived that afternoon. Excellent service!!! <end>  Lovely  I recieved these as a ten year anniversery gift they are wonderfull! They sparkle and are just the right size for everyday wear! <end>
 B0000BY890  18k White Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Solitaire Pendant (1/4ct , H-I, SI2) ||	  Tough decision  It is difficult to purchase a diamond sight unseen. Here's some things that may help.-You will get a good quality diamond here.-It saves a lot to not pay tax or shipping (why I purchased the Amazon vs. the NY vendor item)-There's not much difference in size between a 1/4ct and a 1/3ct stone and you can get the large stone for about the same as the smaller stone if you buy a I color, &quot;I&quot; clarity.Advice -Decide how much you can spend. Cost can increase fast with diamonds and it is helpful to know your budget.-Visit a local jewelry chain and compare sizes of the stones you are considering. 1/4ct is the smallest pendant you should buy and some may find that too small. I surprised my wife with this, but knew that the size of the stone would not matter.-I opted for a quality stone over size. That could have gone either way. If the size of the stone were important, I would have gone with the 1/3, available here for about the same price.-Since my wife's ring is white gold, I wanted a white gold setting for the pendant. That meant I had to get at least a &quot;H&quot; color or the stone would show just a little yellow against the white setting.-You can always send it back/exchange it if it doesn't work.The piece itself is a 5 star item. I gave the whole package 4 stars because the box (which is quite nice) the pendant came in was too large for a 1/4ct stone and made a small stone look smaller. The IGI certificate that came with the stone also has a different (better) color range than was advertised. That's good, but it is different and makes me wonder why.All-in-all, if you're looking for a nice diamond pendant you can't go wrong with this one. Just be sure you know a little about the size and the other factors that go into the stone, although at the 1/4ct - 1/3ct range it really doesn't make that much difference. And you can relax a bit more purchasing a pendant than an engagement ring, where you may want/need in-person help. <end>  Nice but not remarkable  As can be the case with many jewelry items, the display sometimes far outshines the actual item, once received. The necklace is nice but somewhat lackluster and tends to fade into the background a little too easily. <end>
 B0000BYA25  Sterling Silver Men's ID Bracelet, 8.5" ||	  Amazing Quality  This men's ID bracelet is a very high quality sterling silver and looks absolutely wonderful. I had it engraved by a local jeweler; it came out great. I am completely pleased with this item and couldn't ask for anything better. It made an impressive gift. <end>  Beautiful piece of Jewelry  I purchased this bracelet as a birthday gift for my husband. It's heavy and thick. I was a bit surprised to see that the id plate did not have a satin or matte like in the picture however, you definitely get your money's worth.I actually took it to a local jeweler and had them tell me it wasn't silver because it was too heavy. I think that he didn't have the right equipment to engrave it so that was all he could say.My husband will love it just as much as I do. <end>
 B0000BYA42  Sterling Silver Wide Cross Pendant, 18" ||	  Cute, but very small.  This cross is cute, but very small. It's more for a child than an adult. <end>  Average product  The cross pendant itself is quite nice, but I don't think the necklace chain is very good. I thought it would be thicker. It's not very durable, very thin, and it breaks easily...not for daily wear. <end>  Alex  This is a very cool cross I think this is the best thing i've ever ordered. <end>  Sterling Silver Wide Cross Pendant, 18"  Piece of crap ! Gets caught very easy on clothing...Chain has broken twice after having it repaired...My suggestion, don't purchase ! <end>
 B0000BYQSW  18k Yellow Gold 1/4ctw Round Brilliant Diamond Band (G, VS2), Size 7.5 ||	  Great sparkle for the price!  This ring is a great value--the stone quality is very good, and the price is a lot less than identical rings elsewhere with the same gem quality and size. The ring offers a lot of sparke for its size and price. If you're expecting major bling-bling, this isn't the ring for you at only 1/4 ct! If you want a fairly slim band with small but high quality stones, it will be just right. <end>
 B0000BYRF5  18k White Gold 1/2ctw Princess-cut Diamond Band (G, VS2), Size 7 ||	  WOW!  I purchased this ring with a gift certificate from my husband.

I have looked at a lot of jewelry but you have out done yourselves with this one.Thanks! <end>
 B0000C057U  18k White Gold Triangle Shape Earrings ||	  Elegant style and quality  I received these today; a holiday gift for my daughter who asked for "hoops" in white-gold. I am very pleased with the style/shape of these extraordinary triangular hoops, which are sure to command attention and compliments galore! I was unexpectedly surprised at the substantial weight of the gold; yet, they are not "weighty" on the ears! These will work for all modes of dress  casual, office or elegant formal. The bright smooth finish of this gold is awesome! <end>
 B0000C4CI7  14k White Gold Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 6.5 ||	  Pleasantly surprised!  After looking at dozens of other stores, I kept coming back to this ring for both the style and the price (after all, it is shipped free and would only take a few bucks to ship back if we didn't like it!) I do have to say that it did take a solid 3 weeks for this ring to arrive - longer than expected. But once it did, we were so happy with the purchase! It is a beautiful ring with a lot of weight to it - it feels very heavy in hand. It also has the slightly raised center portion that is just enough to give it an original look, but not too much that it looks too trendy. Another advantage over a brick and mortar store is that you can buy the ring in the exact size you need. A lot of regular stores only have what is in stock, and it has to be resized for you, possibly affecting the integrity of the ring. This is a very shiny classic that we are going to enjoy for years to come! Looks much better in person!!! <end>  A beautiful Ring!  After looking in various jewelry stores and searching the internet, my husband and I found this ring and it was exactly what he had in mind! We got married in May, and it still looks brand new! The size charts are accurate, and it fit him perfectly. A great deal for such a nice wedding band. <end>  Great purchase!  Like the other reviewers, I love this ring. It's heavy and durable, but it has nice detailing that isn't too flashy for my husband. He loves it, and jewelry stores would probably charge $500 or so for the same size ring. I am VERY satisfied with this purchase!! <end>  A nice ring  I love the design of this ring, and the fit was correct and comfortable. It scratches more easily than I had hoped, though I have to admit I'm not terribly easy on it. It polishes up nicely though. <end>  My ring  This is my wedding ring and I have had it for 2 years and it still looks great. <end>  Very Pleased  I purchased this ring in November 2007 as my husband's wedding band. It is beautiful. He is very pleased with the ring. He has never had a problem with the comfort, even though he has never worn jewelry before. Love it!! Great buy! <end>  Beautiful!!  I could not be happier with this ring.It is gorgeous, solid, nice weight (it doesn't feel cheap), and it really shines.They shipped it to me several days prior to the estimated delivery date.And I actually order a size too big (I think they run a little big), and Amazon was so courteous and efficient about returning the product and ordering a new one that fit, they really made it painless.I would recommend this ring to anyone looking for a quality wedding band who doesn't want to spend a fortune on an equal product. After this experience I will definitely be purchasing more jewelry through Amazon. <end>  Badly Scratched  The ring had a deep scratch in it. Returned it and purchased one from a store which warranties the product for life. Better choice I think. <end>

It's the only ring he wears. <end>  My wedding ring  This is the ring I bought over 3 years ago for my wedding. Shiny yellow gold on the outside with a brushed white-gold middle.

 B0000C4CJI  14k Yellow and White Gold Engraved 7mm Plain Wedding Band, Size 12 ||	  Attractive, well-designed men's wedding ring  Description  This two-tone, 14-karat men's gold wedding ring also sports two finishes. It consists of five zones or bands. The first, third, and fifth bands are shiny/polished and rounded (convex), with the outer bands in white gold, and the middle band in yellow gold. The second and fourth zones are flat and are raised slightly higher than the other bands, which should protect the shiny ones somewhat from damage. These two zones are white gold with a brushed finish and each are approximately 2.5 times the width of one of the shiny bands. The inside of the ring is white gold. The stamps read "14K" and "FA"*.Additional information  Amazon currently has two of this ring style listed (see http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000EVXWK/ref=cm_rv_thx_view/103-5051791-5395063?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=3367581), one slightly heavier than the other, with different sizes available in each. Unfortunately with both rings, the selection of sizes is limited.Opinion  I had been looking at this style of ring in a local jewelery store but then found this one on Amazon for less than half what the jeweler was asking. When the Amazon ring arrived, I was relieved to find that it was identical to the one I had been considering at the jewelry store.The photo of the ring here does not do it justice. It is a great-looking ring, and heavy enough to feel like gold should, but not so heavy as to be cumbersome. The inside is slightly convex, making the ring quite comfortable to wear.One issue to note  the ring I received appears to have a bit of light wear on the brushed surfaces  some minor nicks and scratches. Perhaps it had been returned by another customer and then shipped to me. I just received the ring tonight, however, so I will need to examine it more closely in the daylight to know whether to ask for an exchange. The bottom line  be sure to examine closely any jewelry you buy.Bottom line(s)  This is a very attractive and modern-looking ring that does not look like a pipe fitting, as do so many other men's rings today. I am very pleased to have found the ring on Amazon and am happy about the design and feel of the product. It will be a fine wedding ring.* Edit  The stamp actually reads "14(c)FG" - the FG = Frederick Goldman. The G looks like an A, though, which I believe must be part of Goldman's trademark. I've had the ring for two years now, and it's still beautiful. The texture on the raised part is smooth now, and more reflective (partly because I mistakenly asked a mall jeweler one day for a quick *polish* rather than a *cleaning*, and didn't catch my mistake before it was too late, and the guy had given it a light abrasive polish), but the ring is still beautiful. Definitely an excellent value; I'll continue to buy jewelry from Amazon. <end>
 B0000C4CKB  14k White Gold Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 8.5 ||	  EXCELLENT Ring!  This ring is by far the best value in the sub $500 price point. I ordered this ring recently and am quite pleased to say the least. The picture absolutely does the ring no justice -- as the craftmanship is outstanding.You cannot go wrong choosing this ring. <end>  Beautiful ring at ANY price!!!  My wife and I decided to update our wedding bands this year for our anniversary. I wanted something different than the plain 4mm comfort-fit yellow gold band I had since our wedding. I looked at many specialty web sites and jewelry stores, but my wife and I both fell in love with this ring. When we saw the price we thought it was too good too be true! We ordered it and received it the following afternoon (with a free shipping promo)! It is stunning! The only minor issue is the ring seems to run a little big (maybe 1/2 a size). Because of the pattern on the ring, it is not able to be resized, but Amazon would let you return it for a new size if necessary. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful  I am not one to write reviews, but my husband and I are so very happy with this ring, that I could not resist sharing this with you.

Also, my fiance, who is "comfort oriented," was thrilled with the fit. <end>  Excellent quality! Excellent value  My fiance' and I have been looking for rings for some time now.

I had almost given up on being able to find the ring and then I came across this item on Amazon -- for almost 1/3 of the cost.The reviews I read sounded promising and I can tell you that I echo everything that has been posted already. Beautiful ring. Excellent finishing. Comfortable. It does run almost a half size big. This is a serious bargain. <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring is absolutely beautiful! I bought this for my soon to be husband and he loves it! The center engraving makes this ring stand out among the same boring, shiny, flat wedding band. Just enough originality to make you take a second look! Comfort fit is also great!!! What a steal! <end>  Great price, quality  I was leery about an online jewelry purchase, but this is a great quality ring that is a steal for the price offered. Same ring is $600-$800 in most jewelry stores. Comfort fit also feels great! <end>  My husband loves this ring...  Unfortunately, my husband and I didn't pick out matching bands because he really likes his ring and I don't like mine. Nevertheless, as a previous reviewer said, this ring does run about a half a size bigger than it says so I would recommend that you keep this in mind when you purchase it because if you get it downsized (as my husband did) then the engraved matte inner band can't be salvaged. Even with the downsized ring it still looks nice....we've been married for over 3 years now and the ring looks like it is new (sans the matte center) both in color (white gold) and quality. We had planned to upgrade our bands but he loves his ring so I'll get the upgrade *yay*. <end>

The picture cannot display how amazing this ring is. And, it is definitely a bargain for the price! <end>  Quite Lovely  The packaging and the ring itself were quite lovely. Also, my fiance, who is "comfort oriented," was thrilled with the fit. <end>  Excellent quality! Excellent value  My fiance' and I have been looking for rings for some time now. I found a ring identical to this at a local jeweler, but their prices were extraordinarily high. I had almost given up on being able to find the ring and then I came across this item on Amazon -- for almost 1/3 of the cost.The reviews I read sounded promising and I can tell you that I echo everything that has been posted already. Beautiful ring. Excellent finishing. Comfortable. It does run almost a half size big. This is a serious bargain. <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring is absolutely beautiful! I bought this for my soon to be husband and he loves it! The center engraving makes this ring stand out among the same boring, shiny, flat wedding band. Just enough originality to make you take a second look! Comfort fit is also great!!! What a steal! <end>  Great price, quality  I was leery about an online jewelry purchase, but this is a great quality ring that is a steal for the price offered. Same ring is $600-$800 in most jewelry stores. Comfort fit also feels great! <end>  My husband loves this ring...  Unfortunately, my husband and I didn't pick out matching bands because he really likes his ring and I don't like mine. Nevertheless, as a previous reviewer said, this ring does run about a half a size bigger than it says so I would recommend that you keep this in mind when you purchase it because if you get it downsized (as my husband did) then the engraved matte inner band can't be salvaged. Even with the downsized ring it still looks nice....we've been married for over 3 years now and the ring looks like it is new (sans the matte center) both in color (white gold) and quality. We had planned to upgrade our bands but he loves his ring so I'll get the upgrade *yay*. <end>
 B0000C4CL3  Men's 14k White Gold Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 8 ||	  EXCELLENT Ring!  This ring is by far the best value in the sub $500 price point. I ordered this ring recently and am quite pleased to say the least. The picture absolutely does the ring no justice -- as the craftmanship is outstanding.You cannot go wrong choosing this ring. <end>  Beautiful ring at ANY price!!!  My wife and I decided to update our wedding bands this year for our anniversary. I wanted something different than the plain 4mm comfort-fit yellow gold band I had since our wedding. I looked at many specialty web sites and jewelry stores, but my wife and I both fell in love with this ring. When we saw the price we thought it was too good too be true! We ordered it and received it the following afternoon (with a free shipping promo)! It is stunning! The only minor issue is the ring seems to run a little big (maybe 1/2 a size).

 B0000C4CLH  Men's Titanium and 18k 6mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 11 ||	  Beautiful ring  When the ring came I was very impressed, it looks even better in person than in the picture. Sadly, it was too big and had to be returned, but it would have been loved if it had been the right size. <end>
 B0000C4KOF  Sterling Silver Open Spirals Ring by Caroline Ballou, Size 6 ||	  Beautiful and Unique Ring  I will definitely order other pieces from this designer! The craftsmanship is impressive, and the weight of the ring was more substantial than I had expected from sterling silver. The ring was presented in a nice quality pouch and navy blue gift box. <end>
 B0000C6BO3  Sterling Silver Earrings With Blue Topaz From The Metro Collection By Zina ||	  Very Nice Earrings  I very much like these earrings. My only reason for not giving them a 5-star rating is that the topaz is quite small. You really have to look closely to see it. But, they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful. I recommend them, just be aware that the stones are tiny. <end>  Lovely Earrings  I agree with the first two reviewers. These are lovely sterling silver earrings. High quality, but with a tiny stone, thus the four star rating. Regardless, these are definitely worth having!! <end>  4 stars because of size of stone  I really like these earrings - they sit nicely on the ear and look great with the matching necklace. The stones are very small, hence the 4 star rating. <end>
 B0000C6BO6  Zina Sterling Silver Pendant With Blue Topaz From The Metro Collection, 17" ||	  So small even a child would not wear it  I bought this for my niece it was so tiny that even a small child looked funny wearing this. <end>  cute but little  The pendant is smaller than I expected. I thought the matching earrings would be small and the pendant about double their size, but this is not the case. Though it is still very cute and since the chain is short it works well. <end>  Pretty But Small  This is a very small pendant. I don't mind as I like petite jewelry but some people may not be happy with the size. <end>  Beautiful, but small  This pendant, and the chain it comes on are beautiful and well made, but the stone is oh-so tiny. This pendant, coupled with the matching earrings would be a nice gift for a young girl. <end>
 B0000C6BO7  Sterling Silver Pendant With Peridot From The Metro Collection, 17" By Zina ||	  The Photo Is Very Deceptive!!  I returned this item immedately upon receipt. Although I realize that the pendant was not as large as the photo shows, I was shocked to see (more accurately, I was unable to see) the size of the stone. A peridot is a SEMI-PRECIOUS stone, so, for $45.00 the stone should be larger than the tip of a ballpoint pen. This pendant should be priced at around $20.00. Amazon needs to include an 'actual size' photo on this type of item or they can expect a large number of returns. <end>  This was not what it seemed.  This was a disappointment. The necklace certainly was not 16 inches and the setting was much smaller than it appeared on the ad. <end>  Extremely tiny pendant  When they say small they are not kidding . The peridot pendant was the smallest pendant I have ever seen. I would only consider buying it for the chain for the peridot is a joke.. <end>  Small, but well done  The other reviewers are correct in stating that this is a very small pendant, but it is well made and quite lovely. The chain is a nice one and for the $19.00 price I paid it is a good value. I purchased the peridot and the topaz pendants and wear them together on one chain. A cute look. <end>  Beautiful Necklace  The pendant is very small. I can't remember if the description gave the dimensions, but it's no larger than an eraser tip on a pencil. However, it is gorgeous and a very high quality item. <end>
 B0000C6BOQ  Sterling Silver Crossover Ring From The Swirl Collection By Zina, Size 6 ||	  Solid Ring Better Suited 4 Scarf Than Finger  Such a solid ring, but it's shape is actually square. This makes for discomfort on the finger, but it works beautifully with a scarf around the neck. Extremely well made and a pleasure to look at. <end>
 B0000C6BPC  Zina Sterling Silver "Signature Swirl" Snap Hoop Earrings Silver ||	  Stylish and well-made  I got these on Valentine's Day for a special person who has a great sense of style. They came in a beautiful pouch and created a suitable "ahh" sound when unwrapped. These earrings are also very well made. She loses earrings from time to time due to frisky hair, so the solid "snap" closure is a huge plus -- these things stay where you put them. The oxidized swirl pattern, along with the close-to-the-ear, slightly "chunky" look conveys a sense of weight, and a refined but playful aesthetic. And most importantly, they made her smile and they look beautiful on her. <end>  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED  When I received these earrings, I was delighted. They were just what I wanted. However, after wearing them for a few weeks, one of them had a major discoloration on the back portion. It was not normal tarnish, which one might expect from sterling. Additionally, I was experiencing extreme irritation, which might suggest that they are not as "sterling" as stated.With much disappointment, I ended up throwing them away. <end>  excellent silver  I wear it almost every day. It is very good and beautiful. <end>
 B0000C6BPD  Zina Sterling Silver "Swirl" Snap Hoop Earrings ||	  Comfortable and classic  I love these earrings. They are VERY comfortable and will look great dressed up or down. These are well made and I highly recommend them (especially at the sale price of $29.00!) <end>  Very Nice Sterling Silver  These earrings may seem somewhat expensive, but they are very good quality, heavy sterling silver. They are distinctive and beautiful--even prettier than in the picture. I highly recommend them. <end>  In love with these earrings  These earrings are beautiful! Heavy sterling silver! I like the click when I close them on my ears. These can be worn with everything. They are just the right size. I am glad I ordered a pair! I ordered them when the price was $52. When the price goes down again, I will order them or another pair in the Swirl Collection. They are worth $75 but wait for a sale, you will love them even more. <end>
 B0000C6BPG  Zina Sterling Silver Snap Hoop Earrings ||	  beautifully crafted earrings  I LOVE these earrings! They go with everything, look chic & are well made. Thank you for such lovely jewelry. mclg <end>  earrings  When the earrings we ordered arrived it was such a joke, they were so small that we could hardly hold them, sent them back.The result was satisfaction for the return, the $ was credited to our card very timely. <end>  Wonderful earrings  Though the Zina ear rings are more expensive than most other sterling silver ones sold on Amazon, it's still worth every penny. This pair is of high quality and can be worn at most of the occassions. It looks smaller than the pictures cause the pictures are enlarged to show every details. Exactly what I've expected and true to the descriptions. <end>
 B0000C85P6  Amazon.com  Mt. Rushmore Black Hills Gold 10K Rose / Heart Pendant Necklace  Clothing ||	  heart rose pendant  This necklace was a X-mas gift and it took quite a while for it to arrive after X-mas. <end>

 B0000C85QB  Amazon.com  Mt. Rushmore Black Hills Gold 10K Rose Ankle Bracelet  Clothing ||	  Sadly Returned  The anklet was absolutely gorgeous but I had to send it back because it did not fit my ankle. Please don't make my mistake, measure before you order. <end>  Black Hills Gold Anklet  I really love this item and it is now a permanant fixture on my ankle. I shower and swim with it on, and it has retained it's shine. The actual rose is a bit small and that is why I rated it a 4 and not a 5. Still, good value and quality for the price. <end>  not what picture looks like  The service was good, but as for the product it was very thin and not good quality. Broke within a week... <end>  Pretty and Delicate  This ankle braclet is tiny. Would be nice for a petite young girl. If you are looking for something that will show up on your ankle this is not it. Very light and delicate. <end>
 B0000C85QN  Amazon.com  Mt. Rushmore Black Hills Gold Sterling Silver Cat Slider Necklace  Clothing ||	  beautiful  I actually got this for my sister for Christmas, she loves BHG, and has been having a rough time lately, so I thought the "hang in there baby" look to the little cat was perfect. She LOVED it. <end>  What you see is what you get!  This item is exactly as it is pictured. The description states that there are grapes on the tail, but actually there are just the three leaves, but that's okay because it is still an adorable necklace. Purr-fect for the cat lovers! The necklace is great, and the service was great. <end>  Necklace Broke  I recieved this necklace on a Friday and by Sunday it was broke at the clasp. I only wore it once. I really liked the necklace but for it to break so easy I have second thoughts about my purchase now. <end>

 B0000C884P  Sterling Silver Thin Granulated Ring by Lois Hill, Size 7.5 ||	  Lovely ring  I purchased this ring as a gift to myself and am delighted with it. I wanted something I could wear anytime and with anything. I have worn this to the office, on the weekends when dressed in jeans, and to a few dinners when dressed more for evening and it compliments everything. The ring is quite feminine and the design unique; however the weight of the ring gives it a durability that stands up to everyday activities. I have been more than pleased with my choice to purchase this ring and would recommend it to other women, or to those men looking for something special, yet not overpriced to give to the women in their lives. <end>

 B0000CC5HJ  14k White Gold 5 Stone Shared-Prong Band (1ctw, I, I1), Size 5 ||	  Beautiful and well worth it  For around 650 (dont recall exact amount) this was well worth it. Diamons were a very nice of good quality and of decent size. ring size available was 6 only, which was too small for my mom. But ptobably that was the reason for this price. I bought it and got resized. She loves it <end>
 B0000CC5I9  14k Yellow and White Gold 5 Stone Shared-Prong Band (1/3ctw, I, I1), Size 8 ||	  Love it!!  I have had lots of compliments on this ring and a co-worker even wants to buy it from me!! NOT for sale!! The stones shine and sparkle brilliently. I am very happy with this purchase. <end>
 B0000CC5JH  18k White Gold 5 Stone Shared-Prong Band (1/3ctw, H, SI2), Size 5 ||	  Would have given more stars  I ordered this item just like that. I noticed that the ring was 18ct white gold with SI2 clarity and H color and pretty much sounded like a good combination with regards to color and clarity.I received the item just today and I was so happy and impressed as soon as I saw the ring. I expected a little sparkle bocz of the color and clarity but it was way too much sparkle for the price I bought it for.The best part was that the ring had an IGI certification along with the details abt the ring in a certificate. I was happy that it was a good deal and it was a good ring from [...] jewelers itself.I would certainly recommend this ring...looks and feels great <end>
 B0000CDVV2  14k Yellow Gold Hugs and Heart Charm Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Wonderful starter charm bracelet  This bracelet is absolutely gorgeous. The price was not comaparable anywhere. Saw one similair in BJ's wholesale club and the charms were much smaller; the price was also higher. The weight to price is excellent; compared to what they want in my area per gram for gold (currently $32.00/gm). This is a 10gm bracelet and you can feel the weight if you know gold. Would definitely recommend to buy for a starter charm bracelet or just to add to a collection of gold bracelets for anyone and there is room to add on more. <end>
 B0000CDVV7  Sterling Silver Multi-Strand Heart Necklace, 17" ||	  Purty Necklace  I love how this necklace looks on me, unfortunately though, it has given me shoulder cancer from whatever material it is made out of. <end>
 B0000CDVV9  Sterling Silver Beaded Stripe Design Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  I love it because it doesn't need constant polishing!  I bought one for myself a few weeks ago and love it! It still looks great and it hasn't needed polishing even after showering with it on. I've stayed away from sterling silver because of the need to clean it but this bracelet has changed my mind. Now I'm going to buy a few for gifts, you can't beat the price! <end>
 B0000CDVVE  Sterling Silver " X & O" Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  UGLY!  Do not be missled by the picture. This bracelet is large and uglier that it shows. Looks juvenile and cheap. Not worth the money at all. <end>  I'm more than satisfied with this purchase.  The person I bought this for loves it. The quality is good, it's very light and comforable to wear, the clasp is secure, but still easy to operate. Granted, it's not a piece of "fine" European jewelry, but it is more than worth the price. We didn't find it bulky, ugly or anything. X's and 0's, just like the picture and description. I would recommend this for anyone that wants to give a nice, but not intimate gift to someone. <end>
 B0000CDVVJ  Sterling Silver Puffed Filigree Heart Pendant on Leather Cord, 17" ||	  Perfect Little Heart  I have had this necklace for several years now. I think it was my first Amazon purchase! Not sure why I never reviewed it, but I love this necklace. It is without a doubt the most worn necklace I own. It was exactly what I was looking for. I also use the black cord on several other pendants that I have since purchased. The heart is not overly huge, just right for me. I dont' thnk you can go wrong with this one. <end>
 B0000CDVVK  Sterling Silver Textured Cross Pendant on Leather Cord, 17" ||	  NOT sterling silver! Buyer BEWARE!  Although this is a gorgeous piece, the cross is in fact NOT sterling silver. When I first picked it up, I could tell it had a lighter 'feel' to it than all of my other sterling silver pieces. (and believe me, I've been buying sterling silver for years)The marking on the cross indicates .928, and there is in fact NO such grading for sterling silver.I even put a magnet next to this piece - it immediately stuck to it just as regular metal would.I then took this to a jeweler who told me it was sterling silver PLATED, and NOT sterling silver.One more thing - upon first opening the clasp, the lobster claw hinge fell completely apart.It was very disappointing that what COULD have been a gorgeous piece of jewelry was in fact just silver-plated metal. <end>
 B0000CEMAZ  14k White Gold Channel-set Round Brilliant Diamond Band (1/4ctw, I, I1), Size 4 ||	  Beautiful ring alone or next to a solitaire  I just received this ring and was impressed. It's very pretty on, very dainty. I bought it to wear next to my solitaire engagement ring and it looks beautiful with it. The diamonds are small of course, but the ring itself is thin, so the diamonds stand out and it has great sparkle. When your hand is in a natural position, it looks like the diamonds go all the way around the ring. I shopped around and this is an amazing price for this ring, some cheap mall jewelers were charging $200+ for lower quality!! I would highly recommend it! <end>  Beautiful ring - pleasantly surprised!  I just received this ring for my wedding in August and I am very happy with it. It looks exactly like the picture except more sparkly in person. It is perfect next to my marquise solitaire. It is thin and feminine, which I was looking for. Many like this that I tried on in jewelry stores were either too wide or tall when compared to the band for my engagement ring. This is only slightly larger and looks perfect.How many jewelers offer returns within 30 days? Plus, it's free shipping! <end>  The Best Wedding Band for Solitare Diamond Rings  My husband bought me this ring for our wedding and it is absolutely spectacular!!! The same ring in a jewelry store cost around $295.00, therefore, we were a bit skeptical of buying it on Amazon.com. As soon as we saw it though, it was even more beautiful than the ones in the stores. It fits perfectly with my 1 carat solitare round diamond ring. Highly recommend!! <end>
 B0000CEMBQ  14k White Gold Channel-set Round Brilliant Diamond Band (1/2ctw, I, I1), Size 5 ||	  Unexpected...  This ring is much narrower than we expected - looking at the photo I thought it would be at least 3 mm....they are much thinner & the diamonds are teeny tiny. I ordered two, one for each side of my engagement ring. Didn't like it, sent them back. <end>  Great for the price!  I was very pleasantly surprised when I received this ring. The diamonds are clear and sparkly and the band is 3mm wide. Not the most showy of diamond rings but it looks delicate and elegant, which I prefer. It goes great with my plain white-gold wedding band. And you can't beat the price - I found comparable bands and even lower quality rings going for a higher price at other online sites and in my local jewelry stores. <end>  What a nice ring!  I just received this ring and it is adorable. It is dainty and was just what I was looking for. A nice accent to a solitare ring. The stones looked great even with a loop. A great price for .50 ct.! <end>
 B0000CEMEA  14k Yellow Gold Channel-set Princess Cut Diamond Band (1/4ctw, I, I1), Size 5 ||	  sparkle..sparkle..sparkle.....  I just recieved this ring a few days ago...and i must say..i'm VERY impressed.. because the price was so low i thought maybe it would be like those jewelry store bands that are kinda cloudy and dont sparkle very much..but it is gorgeous..the princess stones sparkle and have great fire in them..especially in the sunlight...i would HIGHLY recommend this ring...it looks great with a solitare.. <end>
 B0000CEMEP  14k Yellow Gold Channel-set Princess Cut Diamond Band (1/2ctw, I, I1), Size 4.5 ||	  Order and WAIT...  I ordered this product at the end of February, but still have not received it. Don't be fooled by Amazon's statement that it will be "in stock soon." It does look like a nice ring, and there is a favorable review on the same ring with bigger carat weight, but it is hard to say when you will really ever get it. If you need this item in the near future, I suggest looking at another ring, or with another merchant. If you have all the time in the world, then Amazon will be able to get it to you SOMEDAY. <end>

 B0000CEMGC  14k White Gold Channel-set Princess Cut Diamond Band (1/4ctw, I, I1), Size 4.5 ||	  Great Value  I am extremely happy with this ring. Unlike the reviewer who stated her ring only has 9 stones, mine does have the full 11 as stated in the description. The stones are very clear, and have a good amount of fire. I have gotten a lot of compliments on this ring, and for the price it's a tremendous value. It's comfortable, and it looks great with a round brilliant cut solitare ring. For this price, why buy a cubic? <end>  Great quality &amp; a price you can't beat  I did a lot of research &amp; looked at many diamond bands &amp; I was very happy when I got this band (very fast shipping). You will not find a better deal for .25 carat. Brillant cut &amp; sparkle. I can truly say I was not disapointed when I saw it for the first time. I've gotten a lot of compliments. Thank you Amazon. <end>  Pretty but uncomfortable  I purchased this ring and it is very pretty, but because the band has sharp square edges, I found it to be very uncomfortable. Also, I bought this to wear next to my engagement ring and it didn't work with it, again because of the square shaped band. (I returned this ring and bought the round cut diamond ring for the same price, which I'm thrilled with.) The price is a lot lower than even the least expensive jewelry stores I looked at. <end>

(I returned this ring and bought the round cut diamond ring for the same price, which I'm thrilled with.) The price is a lot lower than even the least expensive jewelry stores I looked at. <end>
 B0000CEMHA  14k White Gold Channel-set Princess Cut Diamond Band (1/2ctw, I, I1), Size 7.5 ||	  agutter  I shopped around at local businesses for the same ring. Most stores only sold an SI2, but they were about $800.00. This ring is worth the money, if you can not afford the higher quality. It does not look any different and is very pretty. I am using it as a wedding band next to my higher quality engagement ring and the diamonds look the same. I had it verbally appraised and the dealer said he would think it was worth about $500.00. <end>

 B0000CG07N  14k White Gold Princess Cut Center with Round Side Stones Ring (5/8cttw, H, SI2), Size 9 ||	  I said yes! =P  My fiance surprised me on my birthday with a marriage proposal, he asked me at night on the beach so I could not see the ring, but the diamonds sparkle so much I actually saw the sparkling in the moonlight! This ring is gorgeous, it shines and sparkles so nicely the photos on here don't do this ring real justice. This ring also came appraised at over double what it costs here, it's truely a great deal at this price. The center stone on mine actually is .5 ct not .45 ct like the description says here. The only downside to ordering from here, and why I rated 4 stars rather than 5 is that my fiance said the ring took a very long time to deliver (it was delayed beyond their original estimate). <end>  WOW  I must say that I am some what partial because it is my engagement ring, but it is gorgous! When my fiance got down on one knee, the tears started flowing, I was so suprised. Through the tears all I could see was sparkles, I knew it had to be beautiful! Although the description says that the clarity and color are atleast h, sI2, my ring was certified colorless, and apprasied at 3 times the price that he purchased it for! The quality of the ring is wonderful as well, the setting is thick and sturdy, not cheap and hollowed out like most rings you see at the jewlery counter! <end>
 B0000CGHRH  18k Yellow Gold Round Brilliant Center with Round Side Stones Ring (1/3ctw, I, I1) Size 7 ||	  Wonderful and beautiful!  I gave this ring to my girlfriend when I proposed to her on Valentine's Day. She absolutely loves it. For a small diamond, it really does sparkle, and the center stone is enhanced by the three small stones on each side. The stone has amazing color and clarity; to the naked eye, you cannot see any color or imperfection. This ring is very classy and tasteful; since the proposal, I have received many compliments on my selection. If you're looking for a beautiful ring that will make your bride-to-be very happy, I highly recommend this one! <end>

 B0000CNWST  14k White Gold Princess Cut Classic Solitaire Ring (1/3 ct, H, SI2), Size 6.5 ||	  Beautiful ring, and she said yes!  I'm probably not the first to tell you that I was skeptical buying a ring online. After looking at almost every jewelry store in town, I realized that most of the rings I looked at cost more, being at the same quality or less than what this ring stated. I bought, proposed, and married. She knows exactly where I got it and what it cost, which might be why she said yes. It was a smart decision. The ring looked beautiful, the diamond was brilliant, and it went well in a two ring piece. <end>
 B0000CNWSY  14k White Gold Princess Cut Classic Solitaire Ring (1/2 ct, H, SI2), Size 5 ||	  Great Value!!!  I recently bought this ring for my fiance. It is a beautiful ring and was much less expensive than what we saw at local jewlry stores. I highly recomend this product.I was however shipped the incorrect size, however I was reimburssed for the cost of having it resized at a local store. Dispite the problem with the ring size, I received great customer service and prompt replies. <end>

 B0000DH4SH  Amazon.com  Notre Dame Fighting Irish &quot;Notre Dame Soccer Ball&quot; Pendant - Sterling Silver Jewelry  Clothing ||	  Notre Dame Soccer Ball Pendant is about the Size of a Dime!!  This Notre Dame Soccer Pendant is about the Size of a Dime, so the writing is hard to see. I guess for $36/sterling silver, it's what one might expect, but the picture makes it appear bigger and so I was somewhat disappointed. Each one is made by special order, so it takes a little while before it ships. I contacted the company directly and they were very nice & helpful. I gave this to my niece for her graduation, she's playing soccer for Notre Dame, and she seemed pleased, but wish it had been slightly bigger. I spent $47 with shipping, and felt like it was a lot to spend on an item that was that small. It's ok, but not great! <end>

 B0000DHVN0  CR184 Munchen Music Box ||	  pretty music box  No instructions! Hate that. Any way, it is a nice box, and it has an engraveable name plate. When you open it up and set the disk down. you have to make sure it is sitting on the center hole, and that the off center little knob is also through a hole. When you set down the "needle" it needs to be locked down. Has over the rainbow, silent night, jingle bells,etc... Very old fashioned, like it. <end>  Lovely little music box  Very pleased with the munchen music box - a gift for our daughter - she loves it ...the box itself is very impressive, the munchen plays Silent night,Somewhere over the rainbow and others, a delightful sound and a reminisce of the old time music boxes. Now need to know where to purchase more music "disks" for the box. <end>

This gem refracts light better than diamonds! <end>  Love the bling!  This ring really looks like the real deal.

 B0000DZ5IS  Men&apos;s 5/8 TCW Square MI.D.night Blue Genuine Sapphire Diamond Accent Sterling Silver Classic Ring ||	  Overpriced  Looks very pretty...However, the exact same ring sells for under $100 at other online retailers...just google it before you buy. <end>  Men's ring  I bought this ring for my boyfriend in advance for Valentine's Day. It was only $99.99, so I decided I had better purchase it now before it goes back up to $200. This was my first online purchase, so I was nervous about how it would arrive, if it would be paid correctly, and if the item would really look like what it did in the picture.Palm Beach Jewelry's service is excellent. I got updated to expedited shipping with no cost to me. Of course, the ring was paid for correctly, so that helped my anxiety level. At last, the ring looked just like and even better than what was pictured. It came in really great condition, very shiny, with pretty little princess cut sapphires. It arrived in a neat suede-like crimson box.One thing that I wondered about was the little diamond in the center of the sapphires. I thought that it would be a diamond, but it is metal.Overall, I rate my service to be excellent, my order arrived sooner than scheduled, the ring is beautiful, and I am sure that it will make someone very happy. <end>

 B0000E1VVK  3 Drawer Jewelry Box (Clear) (4.75"h x 5.25"w x 4.5"d) ||	  boxes for your small doodads  I have lots of small items with my jewelry and hobbies and wanted boxes to put them in. I saw these boxes and ordered them and they are the handiest things ever. The boxes fit easily in my closet, which is what I wanted. Out of sight for when the burglers come. They are also easily stored away in drawers or other locations if you are hiding, or putting things away. A great little item. I like it best because you can see through it and see what you have inside in all layers without opening drawers and having to dig around. They may seem pricey, but they are terribly heavy duty. I can open a drawer and leave it open, walk away and come back and it is right where I left it. The cat has not managed to nudge it apart and it has not slid apart because it is just junk. These things will be around doing a Good job long after I am gone. Hopefully, my children will have the sense to see that they are one of the doodads that mom has that might be of some use. All the bouhaha aside, they are nice, nice acrylic boxes and I suggest them over the others I have seen. <end>  High Quality Acrylic  I have 2 of these and use them for storing bracelets. It is 5-star quality. Highly recommend this item. If you need more than one box, you can stack them and adhere them together with clear museum putty. It will appear as one box once this has been accomplished. <end>
 B0000E1VVM  Earring Stand (Clear) (3 5/8"W x 3 5/8"D x 8 3/4"H) ||	  Good, with some limitations  I really like that the holder has a hinged cover to keep the dust off. I also like that it revolves, making it easy to see all my earrings. The unit seems to be well made.However, if you have lots of post/stud and wire/drop earrings, you may want to store them in separate holders. When I tried to store both types in one, things got awkward.You can't store anything, except post/studs, with the unit on its side (my preference, looks more organized). Otherwise, anything longer than 1/2" gets hung-up when you try turning the revolve knob.I stood the holder vertically (knob at top). It's okay, but earrings are cluttered and you can't see some if most spaces are filled.Trying for more "organization" I re-spaced the earrings further apart, but that cut down on number I could store. <end>  Very handy  After searching high and low for a convenient way to store my plethora of earrings, this handy-dandy lil' item gets the job done! A little rough with dangly earrings but whatever, buy two. <end>  Satisfied with this product  I like the earring stand, but it is really best for stud earrings, and small ones at that. The holes are very close together so anything larger than a stud has to be spaced every other hole, and larger earrings even farther than that. But I like the quality and the looks of it. I would recommend it. <end>  Earring holder  This is an excellent solution to storing and finding earrings. Its transparency allows you to quickly find the pair or color you seek. It stores easily on a dresser or in a cabinet. I like this the best of all earring holders I looked at. And the price was reasonable. <end>  Love the way it looks  I love this product. It looks really nice once you get your earrings in it. Easy to find the pair you want to wear. <end>  Best earring holder ever! My husband uses his all the time!  I gave this plexiglass earring/necklace jewelry case to my husband for Xmas and he just loved it. The earrings he wears fit great and don't get caught when it rotates around. If you have dangly earrings, I'd recommend standing it upright. It's the novelty of it that makes it so darn cute! It's in the bathroom on the cabinet and having the clear lid lets them show up as well as protect them. We cannot say enough about this earring stand. We didn't want an earring "tree" for him so when I saw this online, I knew it would be perfect...and it is! Thanks so much for offering this online! <end>  wife loves it  I gave this to my wife at X-MAS and she just got around to setting it up and she loves it. It works great. <end>  Earring holder  I needed a earring holder that would not catch dust. I looked all over and could not find anything like what I thought I wanted. Then I decided to go on line to look. I found your revolving earing holder which closed up so that no dust would get on the earrings. It is just the thing I was looking for. I have all my post earrings in it and still have room for many more............. Thank you............ <end>  Revolving Earring Holder  This is a great product because you can view and select your earrings easily. I like that the fact that there is a hinged door to keep the dust out. Unless you only wear posts, if you use this in the upright position, you will not be able to use all of the holes allotted for storing the earrings. I mostly wear wires so I have to skip a hole in between each pair. If I get a few more pairs of earrings I will have to buy another one, but the price is right for the convenience. <end>  Functional and just the right size  As others have said, great for short earrings 1" and under, not so much for chandelier types. Works fine standing on its end, makes it easy to find what you're looking for. Some styles that have the rigid clasps don't fit or drape well, but as long as you only have a few of those, it works just fine. I'd recommend it. <end>  Quality product  First of all, this is an attractive and quality product. I think it works best for stud earrings rather than dangling. To hold studs you can stack more than one unit. Otherwise, you will probably want to stand it on end as shown. I would use a harp-style holder for dangling earrings. This unit is easy to use and compact. <end>
 B0000E1VWG  9 Compartment Jewelry Organizer by Neatnix ||	  Great to have!  I have one of those large jewelry boxes that has several drawers, like a small dresser. All of the drawers are lined as they should be, but only a few have divisions in them. I bought these organizers to fit inside those drawers, and they fit perfectly. <end>  Terrific Item  These trays are invaluable for anyone who wants to keep their jewelry properly stored and easily available. They allow you to get rid of all of the boxes that accompanied the pieces of jewelry (which take up more space) and have the advantage of making the pieces instantly viewable. They are the only trays that I know of that come with a cover to keep dust away from your jewelry pieces; they are also stackable. They are worthy of the highest praise. <end>  Overpriced  These compartments are fantastic for jewerly storage. My only issue is the price. For those of you looking for a bargain don t buy here. I found the exact items at Bed Bath and Beyond, priced from 6.99-9.99. Needless to say I was really pissed off. I did not return because I had unpacked and already placed my jewerly away. However, I purchased four other compartments and I paid 9.99/ea. at BBB. <end>  Great item!  I have 3 of these, they are great. I keep everything neat and where it should be. I'll buy more if I ever need to. <end>  jewelry box  The compartment jewelry organizer by Neatnix works great for separating each set of earrings. The velvet lined compartments protects your jewelry from damage. <end>  No More Jumbled Jewelry  I now have about six of these jewelry trays and plan to get six more. They are wonderful!! The clear plastic lid and their stackability make them ideal for the job. Don't know how I lived without them for all these years. <end>

 B0000ERU6T  Diamond Accent Hoop Earrings In 14kt White Gold ||	  Perfect little white gold &amp; diamond hoops.  These earrings are just what I was looking for and they are offered at a much lower price than I saw elsewhere. I think Amazon is very remiss in their descriptions of jewelry items, however. It's impossible to tell size from a photo and the description of these earrings doesn't include any measurements. I took a chance anyway and am very happy with my purchase. So that you won't have to guess, here are the specifications  these earrings are about 1/8&quot; wide and 3/8&quot; long. <end>  Beautiful, but too small  I ordered these earrings for my Mom for Christmas... she actually picked them out &amp; had seen the size indicated online &amp; thought they'd be ok, but after she received them we realized they're actually quite small!! So just factor in to purchasing them that these are pretty teeny earrings. Other than that, they're nice - just to small for what my Mom was hoping for. <end>  Great little earrings!  I got them yesterday and they're perfect little earrings! I have two extra piercings in one ear and that's where they'll stay. They are beautiful and so comfortable. And reversible! Nice, secure clasp as well. I'm very pleased! <end>  Nice earrings, however......  This is a nice little hoop earring. I have been looking for a really small pair of white gold diamond hoop earrings and these were exactly what I had in mind. The problem is that the diamonds are not very good quality. The diamonds are quite cloudy, but since they are so small, you really can't tell unless you look very closely. There is still some sparkle, mostly from the white gold prongs that hold the diamonds in place. If it were not for that, I would rate them 5 stars. I did keep them because the size is so perfect and the price was right, plus free shipping. Overall, they are OK. <end>  cute earrings  cute little earrings that are best for children or infants. it took a long time to ship so it was almost a relief when it arrived. thanks. <end>
 B0000ERZFF  20" 18k Two Tone Revesible Omega Necklace ||	  Classical, elegant, underpriced  I am very happy with this omega necklace. Since it is reversible (yellow gold on one side, white gold on the other), I feel that I have 2 necklaces in one.It is a real bargain because it is 18 kt gold. 18 carat gold has a different look than 14 kt. The necklace looks very expensive.Since the necklace is 20&quot;, I can wear it with turtle necks. It hangs nicely just below the neckline. I can also wear it with other necklines as well.I really like the omega's graduated shape, which is unusual. The shape looks very expensive-as if it came from a very expensive boutique. I have used enhancers with it, and they look fine. (I actually cheated and used some small pendants that I already owned for enhancers.)The lobster claw clasp is the right size, so it does not pull to the front of the necklace. It stays where you put it. (I have another necklace that stays in the drawer, because the lobster claw clasp weighs more than the necklace, and inevitably works its way to front and center when I wear it.) The catch is a little stiff to open and close, which is okay in the long run, since that means the necklace will not slip off.The packaging is very impressive-it comes in a rather snobby looking gift box, with an expensive looking case for the necklace. Omegas are stiff-they are ruined if they are bent. The storage case is flat and well-made. With the wrapping, and the shape of the necklace-the whole thing looks more expensive than it is.I am over 40. This necklace is perfect for me. It is elegant, uncluttered, classic, understated, and looks very expensive. I wear it frequently, when I dress up, for work, when we don't dress up but I want to add to a casual outfit for going out to dinner, etc. It is never 'too much'.I cannot believe this necklace is on sale. <end>

 B0000EVX1G  14k White Gold 3mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  Loved it  Really, really comfortable. I never take it off, I wear it in place of my engagement ring and matching wedding band. Since those rings have stones, I am always taking them off to do housework and such. I also use to take them off to sleep. Now I keep them for nicer occasions. <end>  Great Ring - Fits Perfectly  I purchased this ring for my wedding band, and it looks wonderful! We looked at many jewelry stores for suitable rings, and I liked this style the best. But the prices at the stores for this type of ring were at least $150. So I checked amazon.com and found this ring. It arrived quickly and it looks beautiful. One cautionary note -- I originally ordered this ring in a size 5.5, which is the size of my engagement ring, but when it arrived, it was too small. I returned that ring and ordered another one in size 6, which fits perfectly. So if you order this ring, I would order a half-size larger than what you usually need. <end>  14K white gold ring 3mm  I liked this ring it was actually really nice. It was small, but you are looking for something more affordable, and you like white gold this is the ring for you! <end>  excellent value  I ordered this ring to wear with my diamond wedding ring, it just needed a little something extra. The ring looks excellent, adds just a little oomph that my ring needed. And for the price, the value was excellent. Band would be a little too narrow to wear alone, but with another ring it looks (and feels) great. <end>  Beautiful  This is my husband's wedding band. He's had it for two years and it is still as beautiful as the day we got married! <end>  Enchanted  Very pleased with the purchase.... we bought 2 rings, one for my husband, very pleased with the items..... really a great deal for the price.... we love them <end>

SO bottom line...you get what you pay for. Also I saw other rings in the store the same style and price but were L-M color. <end>  not enough info  need the 4 c's please on all of your jewelry <end>

 B0000T2X0G  14kt. White Gold, 2 ct. tw. Diamond Anniversary Ring (Size 6) ||	  A lovely ring  The ring is elegant and sparkles beautifully. The prong and channel settings pass the pantyhose test (for the uninitiated, it is smooth enough that it snags nothing). The quality of mine is H/SI. The description above is lousy as it doesn't tell you that each princess cut stone is separated from the other by a baguette. The picture also makes it look like two of the princess cut stones in the center protrude but are, in fact, set in along with the others.The Fred Meyers store we went to (Littman's Jewelers in our state) had great staff and the ring is guaranteed for its lifetime. Any stone that falls out is replaced free of charge. They do, however, require that the ring be returned to them at least once or twice a year for checking. Fine by me. They also have a 90 day return policy. <end>

 B0000T7R4I  10kt. White Gold, .08 ct. tw. Diamond Promise Ring (Size 8) ||	  Cute  This ring is a lot smaller than it looks. It also contains what appears to be a chip on the inside of the band. However, after going to the store itself, and examining other rings, I came to learn it is just the logo of the ringmaking company. I do wish the logo was not there though. The ring is also too thin for engraving. Overall, the ring is cute and simple. Nothing special. <end>

 B0000TVPQE  April Diamond CZ Birthstone Earring ||	  Beautiful!!  These earings are beautiful! I bought these for one of my best friends, and I excepted them to be of lower quality. The stones shine and sparkle beautiful, and are much larger than I thought. WONDERFUL product!! <end>
 B0000TZGKA  14k White Gold Channel-set Princess Cut Diamond Band (1/2ctw, I, I1), Size 7 ||	  agutter  I shopped around at local businesses for the same ring. Most stores only sold an SI2, but they were about $800.00. This ring is worth the money, if you can not afford the higher quality. It does not look any different and is very pretty. I am using it as a wedding band next to my higher quality engagement ring and the diamonds look the same. I had it verbally appraised and the dealer said he would think it was worth about $500.00. <end>
 B0000U0DDO  14k White Gold Round Brilliant Center with Tapered Baguette Side Stones Ring (1/2ctw, I, I1) Size 6 ||	  Thanks Amazon!!!  This is truly a great ring. It was exactly as spec'd and in perfect condition. The certificate that comes with the ring lists the appraised value, which, in this case, was more than double what I paid for it. I appreciate Amazon selling quality jewelry with minimal (15%) markup on their cost. This means good deals for all. I would certainly shop Amazon for more jewelry. <end>
 B0000U0EG0  18k Yellow Gold Round Brilliant Center with Round Side Stones Ring (1/3ctw, I, I1) Size 4 ||	  Wonderful and beautiful!  I gave this ring to my girlfriend when I proposed to her on Valentine's Day. She absolutely loves it. For a small diamond, it really does sparkle, and the center stone is enhanced by the three small stones on each side. The stone has amazing color and clarity; to the naked eye, you cannot see any color or imperfection. This ring is very classy and tasteful; since the proposal, I have received many compliments on my selection. If you're looking for a beautiful ring that will make your bride-to-be very happy, I highly recommend this one! <end>
 B0000U0EK6  18k Yellow Gold Round Brilliant Center with Round Side Stones Ring (1 1/4ctw, I, I1) Size 6.5 ||	  Breathtaking and overall satisfying purchase  The ring had its intended effect  taking my wife's breath away on our 15-year anniversary. It is a great combination of the traditional channel set anniversary ring and an upgrade to the solitaire engagement ring she got when I was much younger. She loves the ring and I still catch her staring at it in the sunlight as we drive along in the car.The price seems pretty good for the size of stone when compared to some of the other online jewelry shops. I shopped around for about 1 month between 3 shops before making the plunge. The top down photo of the ring is a pretty good depiction, the side view does not do the ring justice (looks too elongated).My only warning to others ordering designed rings is to give yourself enough lead time. Order to delivery was a full month. Amazon upgraded it to an overnight due to the delay. I had to use a 3rd party as well since they would not deliver directly to those stationed overseas. <end>

 B0000U3FNY  18k Yellow Gold 1/4ctw Round Brilliant Diamond Band (G, VS2), Size 7.5 ||	  Great sparkle for the price!  This ring is a great value--the stone quality is very good, and the price is a lot less than identical rings elsewhere with the same gem quality and size. The ring offers a lot of sparke for its size and price. If you're expecting major bling-bling, this isn't the ring for you at only 1/4 ct! If you want a fairly slim band with small but high quality stones, it will be just right. <end>
 B0000UYZJW  Sterling Silver Opal Triplet And Cubic Zirconia Ring Size 9 ||	  Extremely nice for the price!  This is a very eye-catching ring and looks like you spent WAY more than $19.99 for it. The stone is a nice deep color with flecks of green and red fire, and the CZs are really sparkly. I also like the fact that the sterling is rhodium plated so that it matches my white gold and platinum jewelry. <end>  really beautiful ring  I bought this ring for my Mom because it's sterling silver as she is allergic to gold. It's a perfect size and the opal triplet is dazzling. I think I'm her favorite son now. <end>  AWESOME OPAL  THE OPAL IN THIS RING IS AWESOME,DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PICTURE,MORE OF A DARK MOOD RING COLOR WITH FLOATING SPECKS OF FIERY COLORS,I HAVE A LOT OF OPALS,SOME SIMULATED,SOME REAL,BUT THIS OPAL TRIPLET IS THE MOST REAL THAT IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE CZS,BUT I WANTED THE OPAL AND IT WAS WELL WORTH THE PRICE. <end>

 B0000UZ5P0  Connoisseurs Silver Polishing Cloth ||	  great  with all the silver jewelry my daughter has this is perfect to keep it all clean - works well - <end>  Great for flutes  I like the two-sided cloth for polishing my silver flute...isn't too harsh on the finish of the flute but takes off all the fingerprints and smudges. Makes the flute nice & shiny! <end>  Connisseurs Silver Polishing Cloth  It works really well on silver jewelry. Once my jewelry became tarnished I would not wear it. But since I got this cloth and started using it,I am wearing my silver again. <end>  Got to clean the gold  Greetings,I got this polishing cloth and I love it. I'm the type of person who quite often forgets to take off jewelry and end up with dirty stuff, like a gold bracelet.This cloth is fantasticThank you <end>  works well  The product I got works but I have no idea if it is the right product. It came in a zip lock bag with a print out of instructions. Very fishy. It did a great job but I would like to know I really got what I paid for. <end>  Works amazingly well  Using this cleaning/polishing cloth on silver jewelry is both incredibly easy and amazingly effective. It's almost scary to see how much tarnish comes off chains and bracelets that I thought looked okay. After using the cloth, they look fabulous. <end>  Did not use item yet but didn't come as shown in a red box  Don't even think it was the same type. Says it is a certain brand and that is not true or there is no marking I've seen as that brand. Connis... <end>  Works Like A Charm..  I already owned a Connoisseurs Silver Polishing Cloth, which I had for at least 10 years, so was just looking to replace mine...even though it still worked!! I can't say enough good things about this product. It works beautifully shining up silver and I have sworn by it for the past decade. Just follow the simple directions and you will be set. Also great to take with you traveling. <end>  Good result  I just tried this product on my silver jewelry that was tarnished, and after just 10 second on using this product my rings looks like new, so I'm happy with my purchase, <end>  Replacement for one I bought ten years ago  This silver polishing cloth works very well. I bought one at Mervyn's years ago and it never let me down. That one is still good, but dirty with tarnish from all the use, so I bought a new one. If you see that a silver piece you want to wear has lost its brightness, whip out your polishing cloth and in a couple of minutes it will shine like new. Keep it in a handy place, ready to go... <end>  Great Product  I had a small amount of sterling that needed to be cleaned so I gave the polishing cloth a try. It works great and is not messy. It is a great solution for smaller cleaning jobs. I intend to have a few of them on hand. <end>  Did not work  I wiped and wiped and no change in how clean my jewelry looked. It was a huge disappointment for me. <end>  Keep your bling shiny!  this polishing cloth is great value! it is large, and truly makes silver shine as though it is brand new! <end>  Works like a charm!  I've used this cloth on some severely tarnished jewelry and it cleaned up all the pieces with very little effort. Why didn't I get this sooner?! <end>  Expensive, but they work  My wife uses these on all her silver jewelry with semi-precious stones as she has found that liquid silver cleaner damages the stones. Wish they weren't so expensive, but they definitely work. Subtracted one star for expense, not effectiveness. <end>  Good product.  These soft cloths work well to clean necklaces and delicate jewlery. A must have for anyone who loves silver jewlery. <end>  Cloth is awesome!  There was a reason this cloth was sold out at nearly all my local Jewelry B&M; stores over Christmas - it is awesome that's why. I couldn't find not one anywhere locally, so I ordered from Amazon.I can't say enough of this cloth it has made some old silver jewelry now nearly "brand new" looking silver jewelry. Easy to use, even on the most delicate of your silver jewelry..simple as that.  )*****Stars for a great Silver Cleaning product. <end>  silver cloths  cloths work great and are easy to use. Takes no time to polish all your silver jewelry. I would recommend! <end>  Connoisseurs Silver Polishing Cloth  This is an excellent product. I cannot buy it anywhere in Baltimore, and I have looked. It makes house work and jewelry upkeep much easier. <end>  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't have seen it with my own eyes.  I thought that you could only polish silver with some kind of messy paste or liquid. For light polishing duties, this cloth works great. Use it on my antique silver trombone, and just a little rubbing and the silver really shines. <end>  Questionable  The polishing cloth is a great product, its just that the company took longer to ship than antisipated. But still a quality product. <end>  Awesome Product!  Bought this cloth in a larger chain store for less than the price on here. Besides that, this is an awesome product! I had some sterling silver earrings and a ring that had tarnished very badly. I first used the light side of the cloth which immediately removed the tarnish as if it was never there. Afterwards, I used the dark side of the cloth to buff and shine my jewelry. The results I got from this cloth were more than I expected. I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to others. <end>  T Lavitz reviews T Lavitz!  Hey out there...this was a good time. I had a lot of awesome guests along with a core band of Rod Morgenstein and Dave LaRue. It was right around this time that I hooked Dave up, and he has not only been in the "Dregs" now for 20+ years, but tours the world with (Joe) Satriani as well!I feel that the compositions are also good, but hey...who am I to say?Thanks for listening! (reading)...Best,T <end>  The BEST silver polishing cloth  Surpasses every brand I have every tried. Last and lasts. Makes all my silver pieces and jewelry look brand new. <end>  Easty to use and does a great job.  Recently I got my second one as I had "used up" the first one after several years. I keep it in my bathroom where it is handy for giving my jewelry a quick polish before I put it on. Silver loses it's luster quickly and I don't want the mess of using the jar of silver polish and rags every time I wanted to wear a piece of silver jewelry, but this cloth takes just a few seconds to use and leaves jewelry sparkling. <end>  Great for quick touchups  We use these wipes on our silver jewelry and they are terrific. The cloth is hefty and makes for easy cleaning, especially when wiping down silver chains. It takes quite a few swipes to clean your jewelry with these but they really sparkle when you're done. <end>  Great, but pricey  Yes, this works really well. But you can find it in local discount stores for usually less than five dollars. <end>  great product!  very useful! 2 cloths, one for cleaning tarnish on silver and one for polishing. Works great! Highly recommend. <end>  Works well  I used to work for a silver jewelry design and manufacturing company, and I have a ton of silver jewelry. Somehow I ended up with no polishing cloths. I ordered this one and I am very pleased. The tarnish comes off extremely easily and the jewelry looks great. It doesn't come off very well on silver matte pieces, I think that may require some chemical interaction - but on shiny silver it's excellent. <end>  Great silver-polishing cloth!  In my experience, the Connoisseurs Silver-polishing Cloths are the best on the market! I've been using them for years - not just for jewlery but also for silver picture frames. They are gentle, leave no scratches, and remove tarnish effectively. And one doesn't have to get messy cream silver polish all over ones hands and under one's fingermails. <end>  it's so big, it'll last for a while  This is a very large polishing cloth. If you're polishing jewelry, it'll last you a long time unlike the other cloths I've used before that are much smaller. I'm a fan of it, it's a good investment given the size and the cost. <end>  product not as shown  I received a generic cloth in a zip lock plastic bag, with printed general instructions. The cloth was not the name brand as advertised. <end>  Does the job  This polishing cloth is better than the one I purchased before it. The chemically-treated interior cloth takes all the tarnish off quickly, and the outer layer polishes to a shine. It was shipped on time. The only negative I have is that it is over-priced. After I purchased it, I found it for several dollars less in a big-box store. Next time, I'll buy it there. <end>
 B0000V0GB2  Powell 998-316 Heirloom Cherry Jewelry Armoire ||	  Loved It.....  I got this armoire for my sister-in-law. Shes wanted one for ages and this looked like a beautiful item in its description. I ordered it and could not be more pleased with the entire transaction and my sister-in-law was truly on cloud nine about getting it. It has a beautiful finish, the few parts that required assemble fit perfectly and were very easy to assemble and it is an impressive piece of furniture. I don't use jewelry but if I did I would order one for myself.The seller sent the item on time and it was packaged so well I don't see how it could have been damaged even if someone tried.The one warning I would give is be sure you have help moving it when it arrives if you are not pretty strong. It is one heavy box to man-handle alone. I would suggest two people to move the box without any chance of injury.All in all I am completely pleased with both the armoire and the seller. Good job folks - keep it up. <end>  Beautiful Luxurious Piece  I am impressed! This jewelry armoire has definitely lived up to my expectations!! It looks very luxurious and and has plenty of storage space which is exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend this to anyone. <end>  Very Nice Product  Product arrived packaged very well and no damage. Cherry color is nice and everything functions correctly; was easy to put together. One minor issue, one of the side opening cabinets there was a magnet on the actual door but was not a plate attached to the side for it to say shut. Having to go through the manufacturer to get a replacement part and I'm told it will take 4-6 weeks. It is a Christmas present so will not be fully functional till I get the striker plate for the magnet on the door to keep it shut. Other than that, all is well; nice quality. <end>
 B0000V1AB2  Platinum 2.5mm High-Dome Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  Perfect fit next to my cathedral setting engagement ring  I'd been looking for some time now for a plain platinum band that would fit properly with my catherdral setting engagement ring. The plain bands I'd seen previously were not thick enough and they appeared as if they would slip under the engagment ring. The profile of this ring matchs up perfectly with my engagement ring. The delievery was extremtly quick. I ordered it with free shipping on a Mon. and it arrived that Wed. I am extremely pleased with the quality, price and service I recieved. <end>  Great ring - but just so you know....  This ring is really beautiful and does look very nice next to a cathedral setting, but it does have the word "AMAZON" stamped on the inside of it. I'm not sure if this is common for all Amazon jewelry, but it's a little tacky especially if it is going to be a wedding band or such. It's easy enough to get scratched off, but some people might be displeased with the engraving on the inside so I figured it was worth noting. <end>  Platinum Band - Great Deal and Fast Shipping  On Monday night I placed my order for the Platinum 2.5mm High-Dome Comfort Fit Band. I used the "Free" shipping and thought it would take a couple weeks to receive the item. To my surprise, the ring arrived in the mail on Friday (same week).The ring is beautiful and is as described in the item description. Unlike the other review I had read, the band does not say "Amazon" on the inside of the band. I would not hesitate to place an order here again. <end>  Very pleased.....  When this ring arrived, I was very impressed. It was a much larger cross section and higher quality than I expected. It did not say "Amazon" on the inside unlike the previous reviews stated. I am very pleased with my purchase. <end>  BIG disappointment  Not only the sizes are too big according to the provided chart but the rings were all scratched up. I called Customer Service, Amazon stated that all they can do is to email the Jewelry store and the store will get back to me in 3-4 business days. Well, it has been a week and I still haven't received any email.I returned the rings and have to placed another order and put out another 1K (because we were desperate. Our wedding is the following week!) My husband went 1 size down & I went 1 size down from the original chart. We have to pay $12.00 for 1-2 day rush order.The new rings come and once again...they were all SCRATCHED up and dull looking.I am so disappointed in Amazon! You had lost a valuable customer. <end>  great for small fingers  I love the ring and was amazed at the weight even though it is only2.5mm. Looks amazing on my small fingers. I do agree with the previous writer, the Amazon inscription a little tacky. Mine is only a size 5 so left little room for inscription <end>

 B0000V1EVS  14k Two-Tone 7mm Celtic Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 9 ||	  Sturdy, clean lines, 14K  I chose this ring over a couple of other two-tone Celtic bands available, my love gave it to me for our handfasting. It's exactly the measurements described, but looks and feels a little bigger in-person than estimating the 6mm width with a ruler. Has a good weight, stamped inside, "Novell 14 K HANDMADE." Beyond that, it's beautiful. The yellow gold really glows against the white gold edges. A little bigger than the average "lady's ring," it could work for a lady or a gent. <end>  My Husband Loves This Ring  My Husband and I just got married on June 9, 2007. I gave him this ring when we exchanged vows. I did a lot of searching for this ring and Amazon had the best deal. My husband gets so many compliments on his ring. Because it is beautiful and unique.

 B0000V783G  6.5x7mm Lavender Freshwater cultured pearl necklace ||	  beautiful  Just got these, from my husband, today for my birthday. They are beautiful!!! Great lustre, pretty pinkish/lavender color. I am picky about my jewelry and have returned other gifts before, when I felt that my husband had been duped by some "jewler' into paying too much for less than good quality. These are worth the price! I wouldn't even think about returning them! Very elegant! I love the color! <end>
 B0000V8I5S  Sterling Silver Ring With Peridot From the Metro Collection By Zina, Size 6 ||	  Pretty and solid but all are the same size  I ordered two in a size 6 and one in a size 7. Received three so far and although the sizes have different numbers on the boxes, they are all the same size. The underside has a little solid bar, so it's not as thick, probably making it more comfortable. The peridots are specks of gems, so I'm not sure they are even real stones. It's solid and nice looking, nevertheless. Hope I receive the 4th, as they are needed as gifts for 4. Worth the severely reduced price only, not regular price. <end>
 B0000VMC7I  Charm Bracelet (length  7") ||	  Poor Clasp  I bought this bracelet for christmas. it lasted one day the clasp would not stay closed. and part of the clasp broke off. not worth your money <end>
 B0000VMCF0  Large Sterling Silver Claddagh Ring ||	  Quality!  I wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring. When it arrived, I really was in awe of just how beautiful it is! It is a larger, more bold ring - definitely more masculine. This is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love.It's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12. Hopefully I can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice! <end>  Perfect  The first review on this ring set my heart on buying it for my boyfriend, and he loved it! The picture isn't nearly as beautiful as the ring is in person, and it's the perfect size for a man to wear. <end>  Claddagh Ring  I ordered this claddagh ring for my boyfriend as a graduation present, and it came in today. (Exactly a week after I ordered it, 2 days before the estimated arrival.) It is absolutely gorgeous! The packaging it came in is perfect for giving it in as a gift. It is the perfect size for a man to wear. I'm afraid it might be a little small, so I'm hoping it'll be able to be resized. But it is of great quality, looks very solid and shiny. I'm very happy with it!I plan to order the smaller one for myself soon, after seeing the quality of this one. So I would definatly order from this company again. <end>  pleased  )  The reviews really made my decision easy. My boyfriend had been wanting a claddagh for a while now, so I took the holiday as an opportunity to get him one. I compared prices and quality a good ammount and this seemed to be the best option. It got a little close to Christmas even though I ordered it Nov 25th. I was worried since the tracking info wasn't updating further than "shipped". I called UPS, USPS, and even emailed Something Silver. UPS and USPS were really no help at all, but the reply from Something Silver seemed geniune and they really wanted to make sure I got what I paid for. The ring came a day later and I was very relieved. Its really beautiful and my boyfriend loves it. <end>  really nice ring  this is a really really nice ring. it's nice and clean looking, wonderful high-polish, and a nice weight to it. perfect for men or any lady who likes a larger ring. <end>  great claddagh ring for a man!  I bought this for my boyfriend based on previous purchasers reviews. They were right! The picture doesn't do it justice. It is a great size and quite manly, which is a little hard to find sometimes with these rings. My boyfriend is a firefighter so he's pretty hard on his jewelry and so far it has held up quite well. <end>  Quality!  I wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring.

 B0000VO0QE  Amethyst & Blue Topaz Stacking Rings (size  6) ||	  Nice Ring  Nice ring, although the colors do look a bit more vibrant online, as usual. Fun to play with. <end>
 B0000VO1Q8  Baroni Garnet & Pearl Necklace ||	  Not at all what I expected...very disappointed  I'll have to say Something Silver does ship quickly, but that's about the only good thing I can say. When this necklace arrived, I was extremely disappointed. The necklace is cheap and thin, as was the charm and the pathetic little stones. Something Silver didn't even put it in a decent little box. I bought this to give to my sister as a Christmas present...I honestly would be embarrassed to give this to anybody. I sent it back to Something Silver the day after I received it. I like some of their designs on other jewelry, but definitely question the quality. I doubt I ever order anything from them again. <end>
 B0000VO4D8  Sterling Silver Charm Bracelet ||	  Excellent  I ordered this bracelet and was not sure what to expect- I was just hoping for the best and I got it! Beautiful bracelet- prompt delivery. I am a larger lady and it is difficult to find a bracelet that fits. This one is great. <end>  Charming bracelet  I wanted a simple bracelet for a single charm and this is just perfect. The double link style is a bit more elegant than a single link. The clasp is sturdy. It is a very nice bracelet for the price. <end>
 B0000VRGW4  Matte Finish Ring (size  11) ||	  Great product - even better service  After purchasing from Something Silver, I was pleasantly surprised when the order (which had been on sale) arrived three days early. The company was timely, helpful, and create outstanding products. I would recommend their products without hesitation. <end>
 B0000VRIQI  Marcasite Ring (size  5) ||	  lovely and unique ring  I am thrilled with the quality and the look of this ring. Everyone compliments me on it. It is very eye catching. I can't stop admiring it. <end>
 B0000VRIRM  Boma Sterling Silver & Marcasite Oval Dangle Earrings ||	  pretty, kindof small  I have ended up wearing these earrings quite a lot. They are quite pretty, small, understated but with a little sparkle that catches the light now and then. They go well with my marcasite choker. A nice, versatile pair of earrings. I think they are overpriced however, despite their good quality. <end>
 B0000VS0WO  Sixteen ||	  Lovely piece  The pendant is lovely, my client adored the piece I made with it. Highly recommended! <end>

 B0000VWGEM  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz And Iolite Ring Size 7.5 ||	  cool ring  I like this ring, but it is probably not for everybody. The stones are almost "scattered" for a free-style look. It is bold and different, I am pleased with it, and will wear it often. The silver is substantial, not flimsy. <end>

 B0000W53NM  1/2 ct.tw Pear Diamond Solitaire Pendant in 14 kt. Yellow Gold ||	  nice jewelry!!!  Order processing and communication were a little sluggish at first, but was more than made up for. The jewelry and quality are not notch and well worth the money. Beautiful diamond pendant and chain. I will buy from Szul again. <end>
 B0000W57EM  1/5 ct.tw Round Diamond Solitaire Pendant in 14 kt. White Gold ||	  Good sparkle, well received  Bought this for my girlfriend for Valentine's day and she was very happy with it. Her taste for real jewelry, not the 'costume' jewelry is for something that is simple and well stated, as this piece is. The diamond had great sparkle, clarity, and color to it. The reason for the 1 star reduction is only due to a missed opportunity to manage expectation on the part of the picture. The way this is blown up makes it seem like it will be quite a bit bigger than it is. The chain is a rather delicate, very thin piece which might end up being replaced, but seems to fit as a good accent. The diamond itself is just shy of 4mm in diameter, so keep this in mind when purchasing, although I would still definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a simple and beautiful diamond. <end>
 B0000WM01K  Men's 7mm Black Titanium Band (Size 10) ||	  Great Ring!  I bought this for my husband for Christmas to replace his wedding band. He loves it! Its VERY lightweight and not a bother at all. It's absolutely gorgeous in person. And because it is not the traditional gold band - he gets many compliments on it. It was a great deal! <end>
 B0000WM2FO  1/4 CT Two-tone Art Deco Diamond Engagement Ring ||	  great ring, not so great service  For the price, the diamond that comes in this setting, i felt was impressive. it has some fire to it, and it's raised in the setting [not shown from the angle that this picture is taken at -- making the ring MUCH taller than one would imagine], to catch light not only from the top, but from the bottom and sides as well.Again, this image is deceiving. The ring is a lot taller than shown here. Overall the rest of the ring is of good quality as well; the gold isn't cheap or flimsy. I liked it, but it was not what I was expecting.The, &quot;expidited shipping&quot; was nothing of the kind. I ordered this ring on the 12th of Dec., which I felt was plenty of time to receive it in time to make my wedding proposal on the 20th; my girlfriend's birthday*. I did make it a point to explain this to Szul, as well as to encourage them to please give me some way to track the shipment.Well, 10 days, about 5 emails and about 15 phone calls later (not to mention several strands of hair pulled out in frustration), I still got no tracking. All they did was try to tell me that the ring would arrive some time between the 17th and the 19th.I think the ring finally did arrive -- on the 22nd.She said yes, by the way, so I do guess the ring was a hit after all the agony of getting it here. <end>  Very nice people but HORRIBLE service  I bought the ring for my wife. She was coming back from a long trip and wanted to surprise her (I never gave her an engagement ring). Exactly because I had read the previous comments I ordered it with time and made sure I picked the right size. You guessed, they sent me the wrong size (they blamed it on amazon).I had nothing but nice treatment from these guys, I sent it back and they promised that I would have it back on Friday. I still had enough time so I did not worry. They had 5 more days after Friday to get it to me (Wednesday). I started calling on Friday, and every time they said I would have it next day. Today is wednesday and, of course, they promise I will have it tomorrow. Too late, I cancelled. I'll let you know how the cancellation worked out. <end>

 B0000WMC4A  Sapphire Antique Ring ||	  Really pretty setting, but fragile stone.  I really loved this ring. It was gorgeous, but the tanzanite stone came chipped/scratched (I tried returning it to get it fixed, but it came back in the same condition, so I gave up) and later cracked completely in half.  ( I don't wear it anymore, because the stone will likely fall out sooner or later...I'd really recommend this ring (because the setting is so pretty - and so was the tanzanite, before it broke), but only in a stone that's harder (do a wikipedia search for "Mohs hardness") than tanzanite is (sapphire or emerald or ruby or something) <end>

 B0000WMHR2  Morning Glory Oval Opal & Diamond Ring ||	  Absolutely Beautiful  The Morning Glory Oval Opal and Diamond Ring is a must have. The opal is beautiful.

It is everything a woman could ask for in an opal and diamond ring. If you love opal with diamonds this is a beautiful piece to own. <end>  Gorgeous!

 B0000WN7IU  Two-tone Infinity Diamond Men's Ring ||	  Beautiful ring  This ring is beautiful! Everyone that I showed it to thought that I had it custom made. I was worried about diamond quality and size at only 1/2C for 7 diamonds, but they are white and clear and huge (almost too big- at some angles overwhelm the infinity- much bigger in person than pictured). My only concern is the elevated twist and larger diamonds make it look a bit feminine. But this ring has everything I ever wanted and looks like the drawings my husband and I made of our dream ring. I am going to a jeweler to see if I can have the twist inset since it is a separete piece. Otherwise, diamonds are mounted flat and ring is absolutely stunning. Can't beat the price anywhere usually runs $600+ (I've been watching this ring for our anniversary for 4 years!). Completely recommend.Since purchasing, I took the ring to a jeweler and had the raised infinity section lowered into the band. They only charged $75 (and I had picked it up during a $50 off sale!) and it looks exquisite and masculine. My husband loves it and we still can't get over the fact that I found the ring he designed online. <end>  Perfectly Beautiful Ring!  Both I and my new husband love this ring! It is elegant, unique, and tasteful - yet manly! (And that's a tall order...) It is the perfect ring for my new husband! He's received MANY compliments on it. It's not too flashy or gaudy, very tasteful. We are extremely pleased with this purchase. (I was very hesitant to buy something as important as our WEDDING ring online without actually seeing it.) The diamonds are beautiful. I am not a jeweler, but I don't see any flaws in the ring. It is quality craftsmanship. <end>  Beautiful ring  This ring is beautiful!

I am going to a jeweler to see if I can have the twist inset since it is a separete piece. Otherwise, diamonds are mounted flat and ring is absolutely stunning. Can't beat the price anywhere usually runs $600+ (I've been watching this ring for our anniversary for 4 years!). Completely recommend.Since purchasing, I took the ring to a jeweler and had the raised infinity section lowered into the band. They only charged $75 (and I had picked it up during a $50 off sale!) and it looks exquisite and masculine. My husband loves it and we still can't get over the fact that I found the ring he designed online. <end>  Perfectly Beautiful Ring!  Both I and my new husband love this ring! It is elegant, unique, and tasteful - yet manly! (And that's a tall order...) It is the perfect ring for my new husband! He's received MANY compliments on it. It's not too flashy or gaudy, very tasteful. We are extremely pleased with this purchase. (I was very hesitant to buy something as important as our WEDDING ring online without actually seeing it.) The diamonds are beautiful. I am not a jeweler, but I don't see any flaws in the ring. It is quality craftsmanship. <end>

 B0000YUR1I  Forzieri DiFulco Line Square Sterling Silver Cufflinks with Dog ||	  Very satisfied  I don't often write reviews of things like this, but the service I received on this Christmas gift for somebody was rather extraordinary.Not only did I receive these cufflinks fast as lightening -- faster than amazon promised -- and all the way from Italy at an incredibly low shipping price -- but the cufflinks were beautiful, and they were presented in a box that screamed "classy gift" and made me feel very proud to present them.The company carefully left out any receipts or mention of pricing anywhere within the packaging. The invoice was taped to the outside, easily removed, and everything else, carefully and elaborately wrapped, was totally clear of any tacky paperwork.I recommend this company. <end>

 B00011P92W  Silverplated Heart Pendant w/ Swarovski crystals ||	  Don't buy from Dashlynn!  I ordered a Chefmaster 8 pc BBQ set in case from Amazon.com vendor (Dashlynn.com). I knew what I wanted to give my father for Christmas and after searching the internet I found many different vendors offering the BBQ set I wanted. Once I found it on Amazon.com, I decided to order it because I have had such great service from your company. Everything is as promised and on time and with this being a Christmas gift...I needed it on time. So, I place my order on Dec. 11th and the item was listed as &quot;in stock&quot; and my estimate delivery was Dec 18-24. I knew this would be close, but with the product in stock, would be no problem. After a week of not hearing anything about my order shipping, I tried to call Dashlynn three times only to be told they would research it and call me back later -- and never calling back! I also sent two email notes to customer service. Finally, after three days of trying I got an email reply for Dashlynn.com stating that the item was out of stock and therefore I would not be getting it! Now I am really in a bind. I have no time to order the item from another vender this close to Christmas. This has been a HUGE dissapointment! I would have appreciated Dashlynn to notify me immediately after I placed my order of the order status and not a week and a half later, at my request! Also, I wish Amazon.com would not have this type of company listed under your umbrella. I trusted them because I trust you and they obviously do not live up to your customer service standards. I would like this passed on to them as well. I am not stuck with a few days to try and find something else for a gift. GET RID OF DASHLYNN!!! <end>

 B000126U4W  Earrings, 'Ethnic Clover' 1" W 2" L ||	  Good Quality, but...  The quality is great, they are an interesting piece of jewelry. They come wonderfully packaged along with a post card from the jewlers designers. The problem is the width of the earring wire! It is too fat for my ears! I could hardly put them on, and when I did, it irritated my ears so much I couldn't wear them. It is a shame because they are lovely. <end>

 B00012CTYW  Platinum 6mm Carved Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 8.5 ||	  Fantastic Ring  I was a little nervous to place an order for a ring online. However, since there is a 30 day return policy and because my fiance really liked the look of this, I gave it a try. It arrived quickly. We used super-saver shipping, and it was shipped UPS sign-in-person delivery--it wasn't just left on our doorstep. The ring is very nice--heavy when compared to the rings we looked at in jewelry stores. It is in perfect condition-not blemishes at all. Overall, a better ring for a much better price than anything we saw in a store. <end>
 B00012CVU4  Platinum 6mm Carved Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 11.5 ||	  Solid, beautiful ring  I was a little leary in buying a ring from Amazon, sight-unseen, but my fiance's decision to try it and the 30-day return policy made it easy. The ring came on a Wednesday after ordering on a Saturday. It came in a jewelry box (blue velvet) which I was worried about. I took it out of the box to present to my fiance and the first thing I did was look on the inside and there I saw 'PLAT' stamped. I dropped it into the palm of my hand and was immediately impressed with the weight and heft of this ring. It slipped on nicely and looked wonderful. Unfortunately I had to take it off him and fought for a while, deciding we might want to go up 1/2 a size.I returned the ring and within 3 days, the CC was credited and I bought the 2nd ring, this time in the right size. This style of platinum ring was $1300-1600 at our local jeweler. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Amazon as a source for fine jewelry. <end>  Just make sure someone's home to sign for it!  It's true what the others are saying - it is a weighty, solid ring. A beautiful piece of platinum. There is no "Amazon" name or logo on the inside of it, so I worried about that previous customer's comment for nothing. Have it shipped to where you work though... or be sure someone (an adult) is home to sign for it, per the rules at UPS. <end>  You get what you pay for...  Pros  Modern, elegant design. Price.Cons  Wear, beveled edge is sharp, and "amazon" engraving (see my pics in the gallery)Overall  It's a very nice looking ring out of the box. I love the design, and I've seen similar rings costing 3-4 times the price. That said I'm disappointed with how it's aging. As you can see from the pics, it seems very susceptible to scuffing and scratching. I also think that the exterior beveled edge is too sharp. It causes the ring to occasionally catch on material (when putting on shirts, etc.).If I could I'd probably return it, but I'm passed the 30 day limit now, so I'll have to live with its imperfections. As the title says, I guess you get what you pay for. <end>  Very nice ring  I just received the ring and it's beautiful. I was very nervous about this "Amazon" stamp some other reviewers had mentioned, but upon inspection I don't see it. All that is stamped inside is "PLAT". Not sure if they stopped stamping the rings with "Amazon" inside or what, but it's definitely not on this particular ring.The ring is heavy (as it should be for platinum) and was exactly what I was looking for. After finding it here I went to a bunch of jewelers and although some had a few that were slightly similar, they weren't what I wanted. I'm very happy I went out on a limb and decided to get this. The 30-day return policy is comforting because you know you can take a look at it, feel it and than make a decision. The moment I took it out of the box and tried it on I knew I was keeping it.If this is the style of ring you are looking for, than I highly recommend it (especially for the price). Other 6mm platinum rings can go for hundreds more dollars at jewelers. <end>  Fine Piece of Platinum  This ring I received a few days ago. I concerned about buying jewelry on the net. Took a chance and I am completely satisfied with the product. It looks elegant and you can feel the weight of the Platinum. N.B. Be sure to measure your ring size at you local jeweler befor buying online. Saves having to return and reduces your doubts. <end>  Amazon is in fact stamped on the ring  I wanted to help clarify the question about the inside stamping on the ring. Yes, it is stamped "PLAT" for platinum, and yes, it is stamped "Amazon" for Amazon.com. I would have really preferred the ring without the Amazon stamp on the inside, but it is a nice ring. I'm still trying to decide if the fit is right, but it looks great. <end>  Amazon stamp  I recently purchased this ring, and I must say that it is nice. The only problem is that the words "Amazon" are engraved on the inside of the ring, so if you want to place your own engraving it will be tough. I emailed customer support, and there is no way to purchase a ring without the "Amazon" stamp. <end>
 B00012CVZ4  14k White Gold 6mm Hammered Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 8.5 ||	  14K White Gold Hammered Ring purchased from Amazon  The picture doesn't do this ring justice. I was very skeptical of buying it because the price was so low. Yes I've shopped around A LOT! So..for the money, definitely worth it. Comfort fit and sizing is pretty true to normal sizing. The word amazon is however stamped on the inside of the band if that's going to bother you. Otherwise go for it! <end>  Georgous  This ring is wonderful. It looks excellent on my husband's hand and is definatly worth the money! <end>  Great ring  I looked at similar rings at local jewelry stores ranging from $500-$700 and decided to go a different route. I found this ring and thought it was a good deal and went ahead and purchased it. It turned out to be a GREAT deal! It is a quality white-gold ring with good detail and does not have AMAZON stamped on the inside. It is a good weight without being heavy. My new husband loves it! <end>  Very nice ring  Good quality. Nice finish. Good for a man that uses his hands alot. <end>  Good product. Slow shipping  The ring is sturdy enough and hasn't shown any signs of decay. While the product was great the shipping was not. We intended to use this for my wedding but the order was back ordered and amazon didn't tell me. Here we were getting married and we had no idea when the ring was coming. I had to use a dummy ring for the ceremony and this ring arrived about 1-2 weeks later. This is the third time amazon has done something like this to my husband and he refuses to shop here anymore. <end>  Great Ring, Great Price!  I am very pleased with this ring. No surprises when I opened the package, as the ring looks exactly as it is presented on the Amazon website. Excellent quality and an excellent price! It was nice to have such a large selection to choose from on Amazon, and at this price I saved enough to purchase a 'backup' in case I lose the first one! I looked at similar rings in brick and mortar jewelry stores, and I have to say that their prices are MUCH higher.I can also attest to the fact that 'Amazon' does not appear anywhere on the ring. The only thing on the inside is the stamp 'W_14K' to indicate the material composition of the ring.Purchase this ring; you won't be disappointed. <end>  Great ring  After losing my first wedding band (long story) I looked around the web and found this one. Thanks to Amazon Prime I got it right away. I've been extremely happy with this ring. I like it so much more than my original. The color, shine, and texture are all very nice. I think this ring has a sophisticated, but not flashy look. Also, it doesn't have Amazon or anything similar stamped on the inside. It does have "W_ 14k" stamped on the inside, but that's it. Anyway, a great ring. <end>  My Mikey likes it!!  This ring exceeded our expectations. Came very quickly and my fiance, Mikey, is very anxious to wear it. Packaged very nicely. <end>  Simply Elegant and Handsome  I just received the ring I ordered for my future husband and it is PERFECT!! <end>  GREAT RING, GREAT PRICE  NO AMAZON PRINTED ON THE INSIDE OF MY RING. I LOST MINE AT THE BEACH AND FOR THE PRICE TO REPLACE IT I AM VERY VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ONE! AFTER LOOKING IN LOCAL JEWLERY STORES FOR THEM TO ORDER ONE SIMILAR TO THIS ONE I WOULD HAVE PAID ALMOST DOUBLE THE PRICE. LOVE IT <end>

 B00015VKEY  Blomdahl Black Diamond Medical Plastic Earrings ||	  Nothing worked until we trusted this company !!  After 4 month of infected ear lobes, we used this product as our last resort...... They are WONDERful ! Ever since our daughter has worn them, she has not had any pain, swelling or bleeding. Every piercing store should use those exclusively . They are also very cute. We will be back to get more and this is one of those products, even I would go from door to door, and sell. !!!! the price is really fare, too. !! <end>
 B00015VKH6  Blomdahl Rose Medical Plastic Earrings ||	  Very pleased with these earrings!  My order was received quickly and packaged very well. My daughter absolutely loves these earrings. She cannot wear metal earrings due to allergies. Wearing these earrings have allowed her ears to heal and they look great. The backs stay on well. My only complaint is that they are a little pricey for plastic. <end>  Backs slip off way to easily  I purchased these earrings for my daughter, due to her allergies to metals. They are very pretty, but the very first day she wore them, she lost one of the earrings. Wasted $25! I found a site with cheapo plastic earrings for $1.99 a pair. They aren't medical grade and are very flimsy, but will work until I can get her ears healed up a bit. <end>  great for sensitive ears  These Blomdahl plastic earrings are the only earrings my daughters can wear; anything else (even surgical titanium) causes a reaction. If these earrings didn't exist, my kids wouldn't have earrings. <end>
 B00015VKUI  Lg-ball Silver Titanium Earrings 5mm ||	  Excellent choice for newly pierced ears  I had my ears pierced years ago, but had to give up on earrings because of the swelling, redness and rash that I'd usually get from earrings. I only recently learned that my problem was mostly likely contact dermatitis from nickel in the earrings. I also found out that more and more nickel-free earrings are being offered, often in titanium and niobium.I decided to get my ears re-pierced and needed to find nickel-free studs that I could wear while the piercings healed. After a lot of research, I picked these and they turned out to be an excellent choice. They came in sterile packaging, were comfortable to wear all day and while I slept, didn't cause me any skin problems and they didn't react in any way badly from my daily disinfecting while the earrings were in. On top of all that, they are attractive earrings and I will certainly wear them regularly. <end>
 B00017WRKI  Sterling Silver Rhodolite And Cubic Zirconia Ring Size 6 ||	  EXQUISITE FINE BEAUTIFUL  I OWN THIS RING AND THE PENDANT TO MATCH.BOTH ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. IT MATCHES WITH ALL MY WHITE GOLD,AND THE RHODOLITE STONES ARE PRETTIER THAN MY RUBIES. LISTEN UP LADIES,THIS IS A KEEPER,THIS IS A WINNER. <end>
 B00017WRTE  Sterling Silver Iolite And Cubic Zirconia Ring Size 9 ||	  Leticia  This is a very nice ring for this price. The stone is suspended in a bridge-like style. It gives the impression of a very expensive ring. It looked really large to me in the picture, but it is of average size. If you like Iolite, you will really appreciate it. <end>  Love this ring !!!  This ring is really an eye catcher as the other person said that reviewed it, it looks real big but it is a perfect size,I would like to buy it in a larger size for someone else hint gemworks !!! <end>

 B00017WTKG  Sterling Silver Green Mallorca Pearl And Peridot Pendant, 17" ||	  Beautiful necklace  I purchased this recently and have worn it with rave reviews from onlookers. It's quite stunning <end>
 B00017WU14  Sterling Silver Pink Enamel, Brushed Gold Design And Citrine Ring Size 7.5 ||	  Great ring  I wanted an enamel ring like the Hidalgo stack rings, but didn't want to spend a lot of $. This ring is really great looking and fits very nicely. It is an unusual design, and I get a lot of compliments on it. It is a designer look at less than $40!! <end>
 B00017YIVO  Fresh Water Pearl Embroidered Design Necklace, 16" ||	  Beautiful!  The necklace is stunning once it's out of the package...the pearls on mine are more white than cream (shown in the picture) but still gorgeous nonetheless. The picture does a good job of conveying the overall piece, but the color and brilliant luster of the pearls cannot be conveyed. Delivery was unexpectedly fast. It was definitely worth the money. <end>
 B00018MOKK  Bahamas 50 Cent "Blue Marlin" Two Tone Coin Cut Out with 24" Chain ||	  MARLIN COIN PENDANT  I think the coin pendant is very nice and I bought it for a gift for my brother-in-law. It is very well done and attractive. I would recommend it to anyone. <end>
 B00018MOVY  Mercury Dime (1916 - 1945) Two Tone Plain Edge U.S. Coin with 18" Chain ||	  Poor Quality  Not as advertised - this product looks and feels like costume adornments. Spend your money elsewhere. <end>
 B0001DKIPS  Harbor View Craft Armoire ||	  Craft Armoire  I love the concept of this armoire. The product is cheaply made and the sliding part of the table does not work well. Better quality parts would make this item a joy to have. I am not able to use it as designed. I don't pull the table out as I'm not able to slide it back in and close the doors. It does not work as it's supposed to. <end>  Beautiful Cabinet  Heavy duty cabinet and well made. A little time consuming to assemble. Would recommend as a great storage or craft cabinet. <end>  Purchased for scrapbooking  I love this piece! I bought it for scrapbooking. It does not hold ALL my stuff, but the rest is concealed in a closet and this is the only piece of furniture that's out in the open. I keep my Cricut in it, my tool turnaround, and cutters (adding pics for this review). The desk is a nice size, sturdy too. Both boxes came double boxed in a shipping carton that was padded with styrofoam all around the edges. I received them within a week of placing my order. They are very heavy, so I had the delivery man put them in the garage and then I made several trips up and downstairs with the individual pieces, laid them out in my hallway, and began assembly. The assembly does take an average of 3 hours (my teen helped me) and special attention just needs to be paid to the extension slides. Other than that it was very easy to do. I recommended having an electric drill with a phillips head on it. I've owned Sauder pieces in the past, and although they are heavy, pressed wood, they are fairly durable,even with all the moves we've made. <end>  Highly Recommend  The item is very much like described. I love it and am glad I bought it. My only problem was it took about 5 hours to put together with both my husband and I working on it. <end>  Good, Strong and Usefull  Armoire is has described, is is strong and easy to assemble even with one person.I would recommend it to everybody who does sewing or craft <end>  Great look for large or small sewing space.  I bought this furniture for my new sewing manufacturing and design business. I have a medium size office space that houses 4 sewing machines, cutting table, desk, drafting table, pattern cabinet, assorted storage containers for fabric, and misc furniture. This armoire is perfect for my space, it is compact, sturdy, and convenient for sewing and keeping needed items handy. It was very easily put together by my granddaughter. I highly recommend this furniture for your sewing needs and to compliment your decor. <end>  I love it  I love this Craft Armoire. I have asembled it - the majority - on my own. Which amazed me. It looks great and fits my needs. . . as a mini art studio.. Have recommended it to friends and family. <end>  Good enough!  Let's see...Looks nice, sturdy enough (could be better), some sharp edges.Haha yes it could be just me, but I've scratched myself on the edges multiple times. <end>  Perfect compact sewing storage piece!  After much searching, I decided to order this armoire for my sewing room as a compact storage piece and worksurface. It arrived in about 1 week and took my husband about 2-1/2 hours to assemble. All the pieces were there and the instructions were easy to follow. I've now had a chance to organize it and work at it, and I love it!The quality is what you'd expect from Sauder  solid for the most part, but with a few chintzy-feeling components. The smaller shelves and backboard are made from that glorified cardboard stuff, and the casters are cheap plastic. However, this piece has some surprisingly nice touches, such as the 270-degree hinges that allow the doors to swing almost flush with the outside of the armoire, the integrated triple electrical outlet, and the smart design of the slide-out desk. There's not another piece like this available in this price range, even considering the hefty shipping charge. The amount of function Sauder packed into this design makes it well worth the price.I'm not fond of the country look of the doors and the distressed finish. I might paint it black and add some sheet metal over the faux louvers on the doors where I can magnet some of my design ideas. But this piece changed the whole function of my sewing room, where formerly most tools and materials were stored in numerous boxes. <end>  Great solution for a small room  I bought one of these and I love it.I've been calling my guest room my junk room and this is helping me make it into a nicer place for my guests. Now, all my craft stuff is in one place and easily usable when I want to work on a project.Assembling it was relatively simple. I ended up with one door about 1/8" higher than the other one, so I'd advise being more detail minded when attaching the doors. I don't think anyone but me would ever even see the difference though.Very functional cabinet. <end>  Exactly what I expected.  While this item has to be assembled, it is really quite easy to do. I am absolutely pleased with mine. Although one of the doors was broken in two upon arrival, a call to the manufacturer per the enclosed instructions resulted in a replacement door being received within 2 days. <end>  Love it!  This cabinet is perfect for scrapbooking and crafts. The table that extends out gives lots of extra space to work on. The color is more of a creamy off white which looks really nice. I bought this item from Furniturebuzz and despite some of the bad reviews they have had on shipping time I got my order in exactly two weeks. I recieved an e-mail three days before the delivery telling me it was on the way and I got a call the day before to schedule a delivery time. The instructions were better than most for assembly and the parts are all labeled clearly. It took my husband with a little of my help about 2 and half hours to put together. Also for the previous person who commented if you adjust the feet on the bottom of the cabinet it will even out the doors. I figured that out when I was moving it around the room trying to find the perfect spot. The adjustable feet are a great feature. I didn't realize how uneven our floors actually are! I do recommend this item for purchase. For anyone who is thinking about buying this item, buy it! <end>  You got to love it.  11-06-12 This review was written when the name of this item was 'Antique White', not 'Antique Creme', obviously they changed the name since this was written.This is a very nice unit, despite the fact that the color is more cream or blonde (has more tan tones than white tones)from what we consider to be antique white and if you look at the picture you will notice that the slide out shelf when closed requires opening it all the way up in order to get to any items on the bottom shelves and when open you have to bend down almost on hands and knees to access the bottom shelves. However, one of the bottom shelves has a slider which brings it forward a lot. Also almost none of it is solid wood.You have got to love the fact that all the holes were pre-drilled correctly, all the parts were present, including some extras and they all fit together nicely without any problems. The instructions were clear enough if you did not attempt to think you knew better than they do and try to skip some of them (like me) causing longer assembly time. Parts that arrived cracked (I am sure while in shipping) were quickly replaced by CS (customer service) with just an e-mail through Amazon( CS rates 5 stars) without any problem at all (there were 2 of them).This unit is heavy. It comes in two boxes with one weighing 80 lbs and the other 120 lbs. It is composed mostly of particleboard with a very nice finish. Do not attempt to push the unit to a different location once assembled as it may crack or seperate where the levelers on the bottom are located or elsewhere.You can lift one end at a time and kind of walk it if you must, but don't push up on the top molding as screws in particleboard do not hold anywhere near as tight as in solid wood. Also do not attempt to tighten down the screws too much for the same reason as they may lose their grip altogether, just firm, not tight, will be fine.I can not give you an accurate estimate of the time it took me to assemble it as we had to wait over a week or two for the replacement parts because we did not notice the second part was cracked until we were almost done and I made some mistakes. So figure a week for each part. As a rough guess, I would say about 5 hours to assemble.The user of this unit likes it a lot and it looks very nice, holds a lot of things, but pay close attention to the height of the shelf where your sewing maching will go as it is not adjustable. The height is 12 7/8" according to their diagram but I measure it at 13 1/8" high. The electrical outlet does not have a way to turn it off, so it is always on. However it does have a red light to indicate it is on.The electrical cord itself is pretty thick (which is good) but I could not get the cord holder the unit comes with in the back to hold it. You push the cord into it and it expands enough that it is susposed to hold it.The sewing machine shelf is rated at 30 lbs weight load. The next shelf up is 25 lbs and the smaller adjustable shelves further up are 3 lbs each. The very top of the unit is rated at 15 lbs (keep that in mind if you want to put a tv or something up there). The sliding shelf that extends out from the unit (work/hobby shelf) is rated at a 25 lb load. The very bottom shelf (1st one above the floor) is rated at 20 lbs. <end>  OK unit BUT......consider this before you buy.  Thought I'd found the perfect piece until after we put it together. Assembly  At least 3 people are required to put this together. For example. It takes 2 people to hold heavy pieces in place while a 3rd lies on the floor underneath to screw hinges in place. However, the instructions are clear, especially if you've done your own assembly on this type of product before. We had no trouble following the directions and they provide appropriate cautions along the way. You just need extra help.Finish  The color is dark/yellow ivory (no where close to white). It has a "distressed" finish that looks like 3 rollers were drug down/across all the pieces - parallel lines without any randomness. In places the exposed wood is one inch wide. Sauder is sorry I'm disappointed. They explained the finish is a paper laminate. It will not hold paint. If I decide to paint it I will void the warranty on the finish. Unlike other Sauder products we have enjoyed over the years it just plain looks cheap. Had I seen this in a store I never would have bought it.Use  The casters on the leg (installed properly) would not roll when I tried to open it. I had to lift the very heavy fold down section and hold it up while reaching far back underneath to grasp the leg to extend the pull out shelf and the lift up table. First time I opened it the table overextended in the process. Now there is a large gap on the work surface between the two pieces. We worked hard (following the directions) to make sure there was no gap when putting it together. But I could not open it without creating a gap. The screw holes for the hinges are now probably stripped because there's no other way to get at that leg. There's no handle - no hand holds - nothing to assist. You just go for it. Maybe I should have used 2 people. I had trouble closing it by myself when first assembled. I didn't really take note it required 2 of us to close it. I guess it takes two to open and close. Also - the leg is in the way when you sit to work at it.The gap on the work surface is sure to be a problem. Stuff WILL fall through or get caught. It will be uncomfortable to use seated due to the position of the leg. In the long run I may just decide to sell it and buy something else. It would be a nightmare to disassemble and return. I no longer have the packing and it came in two large heavy boxes. Its heavy. Its sturdy. But the quality of the finish and the difficulty opening and closing it should be considered before you buy this.I had high hopes but in the end I'm just plain disappointed. <end>  Craft Amoire  This was a booger to load up in my car after I had it delivered to my office while I was moving - definitely have it delivered to where it will be living (I didn't have a choice at the time) because it arrived in two gigantic and rather heavy boxes that are impossible to handle by yourself. Once I got the thing transported over to my house, it took me about an hour to unpack the boxes (they REALLY didn't want anything getting hurt in transit - which is good because I was convinced it had to be broken by the shape of the box but it had an interior box and padding that kept it perfectly preserved). It took me a total of 5 hours (start to finish with unpacking the boxes) to put it all together. Although - what do you expect? It has lots of shelves, a nice top, adjustable levelers on the bottom and the roll out work surface with extension. It was completely worth it - although the dogs wanted nothing to do with me while I was putting it together as I laughed like a crazy person when completing tasks that had taken a while and were frustrating (word to the wise - when putting the levelers on - don't put the black piece on and then hammer the nut through it - it's impossible to hold the tiny nut on the side and hammer it's too small to hold - lay the black plate on concrete and use gravity to hold the nut in place and it will work much easier. The nut is bigger than the hole and they are metal - so trying to hold it on there and pound it in at the same time is bonkers - trust me - it took 2 seconds once I figured this out and I'd been messing with it for 15 minutes). It looks really nice in my house and looks like a big nice armoire - sometimes craft storage look cheaper than nicer furniture but this looks good. It's not bright white though - it's more of a antiqued cream but it's very pretty!All in all, I would certainly recommend this piece - it is quality and very sturdy - follow the directions and read each tiny little blurb it will save you time. I put it together by myself, if you had a friend - it would move much faster. Happy Crafting!!! <end>  CRAFT ARMOIRE  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PIECE! VERY NICE LOOKING ANDHAS MUCH STORAGE SPACE; THE NEAT THING ABOUT THIS ISTHAT YOU CAN CLOSE EVERYTHING UP AND ONLY SEE THENICE SHUTTER DOORS.TAKES MUCH TIME TO PUT TOGETHER BUT WORTH IT! <end>  Exactly what we were looking for  Really needed something to organize sewing/crafting supplies. This puts everything together in one area that can be easily closed up and leaves organized living space around it. Best buy for me. <end>  My favorite piece of furniture!  My husband and kids went together and got me this for Christmas this year. I love it. I love sewing for my grandkids and my family room always looked so messy with my stuff everywhere. Now everything is in one place and my room looks neat and clean all the time now. This is a fantastic addition to my furniture. <end>

 B0001EZUH8  1/2 ct.tw Princess Diamond Solitaire Ring in 14k White Gold ||	  Not worth the money  I was very disappointed when I recieved this ring. While the stone was very nice, the setting looked very cheap and flimsy. There just was not enough gold thickness anywhere and it looked like it would be very easy to bend or be damaged in everyday wear. Besides getting bent, I would worry that the stone might pop out of this setting too easily as well because the supports for the stone were not very substantial either. While the price of this ring was reasonable for the size and quality of the diamond, I really think a much better quality setting could have been used to hold the lovely stone-the setting cheapened the whole look of the ring.

 B0001F08G0  1/5 ct.tw Round Diamond Solitaire Ring in 18k White Gold ||	  not satisfase  i expect like regular size of ring,but this one look like a ring for toy or something funy, the MM of our rings is 5MM and this ring may be is 1MMso ridiculousMartin1/5 ct.tw Round Diamond Solitaire Ring in 18k White Gold <end>
 B0001IPQNM  14kt YG Twisted Weave Hoop Earrings ||	  Buyer Beware!  These earrings were a huge disappoinment! Whether they are really 14 karat gold or not they look absolutely fake! The two curved peices of metal that comprise each earring were made with 2 different colors of yellow. One of the wires actually looks like 10 karat yellow gold and positioned right next to the other wire which looks overly yellow "gold" for any karat. Almost light orange in color. These even looked worse than the junk you might find at a drug store that lasts for a week. It's safe to say I won't be buying anything from J&R Jewelry World in the future and I am very disappointed in Amazon.com for even offering this Co.'s products. <end>
 B0001M15EM  Akoya Cultured Pearl Stud Earring (7-7.5mm) ||	  PEARL STUD BROKEN,  I RETURNED THE EARRINGS PER INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY PEARL CLOSEOUTS, AND HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD FROM THEM.

 B0001NEBQU  Music Box ||	  A great simple music box.  I wanted a simple, study music box for my two year old daughter. Nothing fancy - she tore the ballerina off the last one in under a minute. This one fits the bill. You can paint it, but we left it a natural wood since it looks nicer. Next year we may get a couple for her to paint for her grandparents as gifts.A solid music box at a good price. <end>
 B0001V58FA  Bracelet Buddy (Set of 2) - Gift for Mom and Grandma - Made in USA ||	  Not very good quality  The protects are a good design. But it is cheaply made. The quality of the tool is very bad. I didn't think it was good for a gift. <end>  works  quick receipt, as described and works. given as a gift and received well by family member. Like this product.  0) <end>  Great idea but poorly made  This is a great idea and could be a great help but it broke the first time I tried to use it. It was cheaply made and came apart. Guess you get what you pay for but I thought I paid for better than I got this time. <end>  Bracelet Buddy is great!  The Bracelet Buddy really works. It is light weight but it does the job. I gave one as a gift and the friend liked it too. Thanks, Jane <end>  Cheap Plastic  It does work, but is made of cheap plastic. Now, if it cost only $2.00, that would be understandable. I don't harbor any illusions that it will last very long. <end>  Does its job, doesn't solve the problem  This little gadget is a great idea for short bracelets. However, the bracelet which prompted me to order it has such a tiny clasp that it is anybody's guess as to whether or not I will be able to garner much help in the way of actually getting the thing fastened. I have found my husband to be more helpful! <end>  Awesome....  I have been using this for more than 6 years now. It took me few days to get used to it, but once I did, I was in heaven. I did not need my husband to help me close all the lobster claw clasp bracelets anymore. I came back to order one more set as a present for my friend that lives in France and saw mine when I was visiting her for few days this year. This will be one of the things she will find under the Christmas tree. I know she will be thrilled and she will no longer struggle to close her lobster claw clasp bracelets in the morning. I was so happy to find the set on Amazon at such affordable price! <end>  Braclet Buddy Set--Gift for Mom and Grandma.  I do like the Bracelet Buddy. It makes bracelets easier to put on when one has fingers that do not cooperate with little things like clasps etc. The enclosed picture and written direction flyer for both hands is handy. It is "half-toothless" so the plastic alligator clamp should not scratch. The molded plastic handle is easy to hold with either hand. With a bit of thought and ingenuity, one could invent other ways to put this device to good use. AND it is made in the USA--YEA! It is hard to find USA-made "stuff". Oh, it was purchased for me, myself and I--Grin! <end>  MUST HAVE ITEM!  This bracelet buddy is a real helper. It is so easy to put a bracelet on without having to ask for help.Everyone who wears bracelets should own of these. I have not found any stores that carry them, but Amazon.com has them and ships quickly.Make a nice gift too! <end>  Bracelet Buddy  I had a bracelet buddy for ten years and it suddenly broke. Without it I am not able to put on my bracelets alone. I found bracelet buddy on Amazon and was overjoyed. I ordered a replacement and received it within days of ordering it at my home. I am very happy with the product and especially relieved to be able to put my own bracelets on my arm without any assistance.Bracelet Buddy (Set of 2) - Gift for Mom and Grandma - Made in USA <end>  Wonder Tool  I could never get my bracelets on and would have to carry them with me. Now I can do it by myself and not wait for help. I'm left handed and have no problem using it. <end>  Makes a great gift!  I gave this to my mom for Christmas and she was ecstatic! She couldn't wait to try it out. The only thing I didn't like was that they had said the claw was coated so it wouldn't damage the bracelet but I couldn't see or feel any coating. Oh well.  -) <end>  quincy gal  The bracelet buddy was just as described. Now I can finally wear those pesky bracelets that I could never hook by myself! <end>  great purchase  not having to find someone available to assist when I wish to wear a bracelet is just perfect and this little gem makes anyones life so much easier <end>  Awesome product  I have a bracelet buddy and it is great! Bought bracelets with lobster claw clasps for my daughters and gave each one a bracelet buddy along with it. They both love them! They are very easy to use and a time saver when you need an "extra hand" putting on jewelry. Would highly recommend these items. <end>  A Great little gadget  I really like this. I was having a lot of difficulty putting on my bracelets and was frustrated enough that I wouldn't even buy them if they had a clasp. Using this, I can fasten any of my bracelets with ease now and I don't have to worry about what type of bracelet it is. I haven't had a problem with any of the bracelets I've tried it on so far. <end>  awesome  I can't believe I didn't see this product before now. WOW!!! It only takes me 10 seconds to put on my hard to do bracellets now instead of fumbling for minutes. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. <end>  great company!  my original product was stolen from my mailbox. The company was very responsive to my needs. I recommend them highly. The product is also good. <end>  not just for Grandma!  not just for grandma anymore! great product for the single gal who doesn't have anyone to hook those bracelets for her! <end>  Good for all ages teens thru retirees  I have given this as a gift to just about all women in immediate family and a niece too.If you know a young girl or a mature woman who wears snap or any clasping bracelets they will thank you for this inexpensive and usefull gift.It is something they will really use and appreciate more evry time they put on one of those fine chain bracelets or the like. <end>  Works Great !  This item works great. It is easy to use and has worked on every type of bracelet that I have tried it on. Now I can wear all of my bracelets again - even the ones that had become too difficult for me to put on due to arthritis. I would recommend the Bracelet Buddy to anyone who is having difficulty with the clasps on their jewelry. <end>  great gift  I purchased this gift for my mother who is 82 years young and she absolutely loved it. She can now fasten her necklaces in front and her bracelets are no longer sitting in her drawer.Thanks for a great product. <end>  Braclet buddy  I bought these for Christmas presents and have not used them yet. I was disappointed that they were made of plastic and I am concerned it will not last. They look very pretty and are long enough. <end>  Great gift  The Bracelet Buddy was a gift for my wife this past Christmas. She has told me several times how much she likes it since I'm not always around to help her with difficult bracelets. <end>  Wonderful invention  This tool makes putting my bracelets on so much easier. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wears bracelets. <end>  Just ok  The gadget does work. I find it bulky, gawky, looks like cheap plastic. I bought two, one as gift. Not worthy of gift giving. <end>  Bracelet Buddy/ Love it.  Bracelet buddyWell pleased/ met all requirements.Gave one as a gift and recepient is pleased also.Will order more items from time to time.Thank You,Barbara Young <end>  FABULOUS!  Mom and I both benefited from the two pack of Bracelet Buddy.It is well made, and now we have the self-confidence of being that much more self-assured that we can get our bracelets properly clasped.Mom loves it, and I think this is one of those rare presents that are developed and brought into being just because there is a necessary use out there. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  Not as good as one I purchased from TV quite a while ago. The end didn't hold the bracelet as tight as it should. <end>

 B0001WIBKS  Pugster Engraved Pattern Beads Fits Pandora Charms (not Include Bracelet) ||	  Lovely piece but broke easily  I loved this piece when I first got it, but the bead fell off the second day I wore it. I ordered two at the same time, one for each of my childrens birth months. One of the pieces has held up well but the other one keeps coming apart. I have tried everything to fix it ie- new wire, super glue. I finally just ordered a different style to replace the one that keeps breaking. Please do keep in mind that I still have one that is doing fine so you may want to take the chance if the price is right. <end>
 B0001WICSE  Pugster Dangle November Heart Italian Charm Bracelet ||	  disappointed  I purchased 2 of these , one for a gift and the first week the charm came off and was lost.

 B0001Y0QZY  Corona Titanium Ring with 14K Gold Center ||	  Nice ring, but....  My husband picked this ring out because he thought it was cool that titanium is so strong. Well, yes, but 6 years and too much pizza and it no longer fits him. That's his fault, but titanium's strength is also it's weakness. You can't re-size it if you need to. <end>

 B0001ZSZ0G  Royce Leather Ladies' Pocketbook Jewelry Case ||	  Tangles Necklaces  I got this for my wife at Christmas. We then had to travel across country from SC to WA. During the trip she kept some of her jewelry in this case. You know, the stuff she wears all the time. Well I spent hours untangling all her necklaces. They slip into the top of the case and are held in place by a little hook. The other end is free to move around. Presto! tangled necklaces. There is no way to hold the bottoms in place and if the case turns upside down (which happens when your moving luggage) the necklace slips off the top clip. Very disappointed. <end>  leather pocketbook jewelry case  not what i needed in size (too small for all the jewelry my granddaughter like to carry with her most of the times <end>  Very happy with the item  I do not have a problem with this pocketbook, my uses it everytime we get to travel and so far no complaints from her, quality is excellent and very convinient. Has a lot of space for my wife's jewelry. Will recommended to everyone <end>  Great Product!  Love this jewelry case. The exterior design is great, and the interior is well divided. My necklaces, rings and earings all have their place inside this well designed jewelry case. <end>  Girlfriend Loves It  Have had a wonderful experience with this jewelry storing pocketbook. My girlfriend travels extensively and loves it. Says the leather is as soft as anything she;s ever felt before and the stitching was quite nice. Would definitely buy again <end>
 B0001ZVD3W  14k Yellow Gold D/C 20 Inch X 5.0 mm Rope Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  Very nice guy's necklace  I bought a necklace almost identical to this one, 14k, 20", 5mm, DC w/lobster clasp in August. I am not into the hip-hop/rap culture and wanted a classy necklace without the gaudy look of the aforementioned culture. This necklace was even nicer than I had expected. I was really suprised by the quality and craftsmanship. If you are looking for nice piece of jewerly for yourself then by all means check out this necklace. You will not be disappointed. <end>
 B0001ZVDBY  14k White Gold 22 Inch X 4.0 mm Curb Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  Makes a nice gift..  My boyfriend loved it! However the box it came in wasn't too pretty. <end>
 B0001ZVE86  14k White Gold 24 Inch X 2.0 mm Rope Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  gold chain fails quality check  We had to return this item due to its quality. It was very flimsy and was not a 2mm chain. Very dainty and not at all what we thought. Certainly not worth the price paid <end>  Excellent  This chain is great! I love it, the company is a great one too. <end>
 B0001ZVG6Q  Childrens Pierced Hoop Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Chilrens pierced hoop earrings  Cute earrings, but alot smaller than what the picture leads you to believe. I would not have bought them had there been a measurment description. <end>
 B0001ZVH4C  Two-tone Saturn Bead Ankle Bracelet - JewelryWeb ||	  Cute anklet!  I love this anklet. It's simple, but just enough for me. I also have a matching necklace. It goes with both my white and yellow gold jewelry, so it's versatile as well. It's definitely more of a dainty looking anklet, but pretty strong (I'm pretty hard on my jewelry). <end>  Too fragile  The ankle bracelet was very pretty but very thin and hard to see when on. It is so delicate that the clasp came undone the first time I wore it and I have not seen it since. Am very disappointed. <end>
 B0001ZVNNC  14k Yellow Gold 16 Inch X .8 mm Box Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  16 inch gold box chain  As promised--I returned it for an 18 inch. Seller lost my return info in the mailroom, so didn't know who to send the new 18 inch chain to--taking over 2 weeks to get the new one. <end>  Beautifull chain but Beware!  It may just be my stupidy but a 16" chain is only 8" around once clasped!I bought this for my wife as she needed a longer chain for a pendant she owns. I figured 16 inches should be long enough but alas, it's more like an ankle bracelet! It's 16" if you unclasp it and lay it out! Hook it and it won't go around even a childs neck! Lovely chain, just watch the measurements! <end>
 B0001ZVNPA  14k White Gold 16 Inch X .7 mm Box Chain Necklace - O Ring Clasp - JewelryWeb ||	  It's Okay.  The chain was too thin and it did not look like it was even a .7mm box chain and after searching for a thicker chain I found this one was much more expensive than it was worth. <end>
 B0001ZVR42  14k Yellow Gold 18 Inch X 1.0 mm Box Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  Lovely Chain  This is a very well made, high quality yellow gold chain. The price was very good and retails stores sell a similar quailty for $185 or more. I would recommend this lovely chain. Because of the box link, it has a great shine to it as well! <end>
 B0001ZVU5I  14k White Gold Round 18 Inch X 1.0 mm Wheat Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  Nice Chain  Excellent product made well, it's very smooth and does not snag on fine material. Perfect size it easly fits the small opening on the pendent.Great price for a "14K White Gold Necklace." <end>
 B0001ZVUL2  14k White Gold 20 Inch X 2.3 mm Cable Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  Perfect  I needed a 20" white gold chain to hold a rather heavy large chunky white gold pave diamond pendant. This chain is perfect. The cable links are strong and well made. Additionally, an unexpected surprise is the exceptional shine of this chain. It really sparkles all on it's own! Highly recommend!The lobster clasp could have been a tad larger but overall a really great chain for the price. <end>  great quality  Very nice chain and really great quality. 2.3 mm is a perfect weight for a man's necklace. <end>
 B0001ZVUMQ  14k Yellow Gold Round 16" 1.0mm Wheat Chain Necklace - Lobster-claw - JewelryWeb ||	  Gold Necklace  This is a beautiful necklace, very sparkly. It's great to put charms or pendants on because it's the perfect size. Some chains are too thick, but this size is perfect! <end>
 B00020SABO  Sterling Silver Mosaic Three Ring Turtle Stack Set ||	  very cute ring  This is a really cute ring. And if you wanted you could wear the center ring with the stone by itself. <end>
 B00020V2NC  Onyx 18k Gold over Sterling Silver Cameo Ring ||	  Great Product, great price, speedy service  This has to be one of the prettiest rings I own. I love cameos and this one is very nice. The little faux diamonds sparkle beautifully and nobody could miss it on your hand. It is very large, but also comfortable to wear. If you love large rings like i do, this is perfect. It covers the top part of my right hand pointer finger but does not go past the knuckle. It's a great price for a beautiful piece of jewelry. <end>  Face was not centered on black stone...it was low down..  I have seen almost identical rings to this one that are real that go for a couple of hundred dollars. So when I saw this for $20.00 I was thrilled. When I got it and opened the box it was immediately notable that the mother of pearl looking cameo face was very very off centered when glued on the black stone. It was lower than it should be. I will return this ring most likely. If it were centered it would be pretty but you can see a very slight glue edge. As I said for the price if the face were in the center I would keep the ring. Very disappointing. The shipping however was extremely fast and I liked the free cleaning cloth that was included. <end>
 B000216N94  14kt Gold Big Sis Mom Lil Sis Break-A-Part Heart Charm-M310 ||	  So Sweet  My mom cried when she got this, normally there is only a mom/daughter break apart, but this charm captured the three of us prefectly! <end>

 B00021GT5C  10kt. White Gold, 1/8 ct. tw. Diamond Hoop Earrings ||	  Delicate and Sparkling!  I have purchased many pieces of jewelry online and from television shopping channels. I have to say that the quality of diamonds, though small, are very good. I have received compliments on them. In fact, more compliments on them than on my larger diamonds of less quality. I plan on returning to Littman for further purchases in the future. This was my birthday present to myself.....I'll start planning for Christmas! I urge anyone who appreciates fine diamonds and gold to place an order. You will be very pleased! <end>  Delicate and Beautiful!  Just received the earrings yesterday. These are for a xmas present and they are beautiful for the price and size. I am going to buy me a pair in gold. Stunning also.. <end>

 B000229FJS  'Well Behaved Women...' Reversible Necklace (length  16") ||	  great necklace for strong women  this is a very simple, yet beautifully elegant necklace that also shows off your strong side. I bought one for myself, my mother, and all my bridesmaids. So very pleased by the quality <end>  love this!  I saw this necklace several years ago and when I went back to get it, it was gone. Finally decided to search for it online and found it! I absolutely live by this saying....E. Roosevelt was an incredible woman, especially considering the era she lived in.I have two issues with this necklace. One, I wish it came with a longer chain and Two, the lettering on the reverse side is not as strongly engraved...not bad, just not as bold as the other side. But, it did arrive when promised, and was well packaged. <end>  Cute, casual necklace  I received this adorable necklace as a gift, and I get lots of questions about and compliments on it. I love the saying, and it's a perfect gift to give a girlfriend! The only reason I gave it four stars is that I think the chain it came on was too short for the nearly 2" dangling necklace pendant. I opted to buy a more casual, thin dog-tag looking chain that was a little longer and it's now my favorite every day necklace to wear. Super cute! <end>  Lovely necklace  I was so excited to receive this necklace; it came beautifully wrapped (could have given it as a gift without re-wrapping) and exactly as described. The chain is a sturdy, round link, and I've gotten many compliments on the pendant (not very heavy, but it's not very big to begin with). Hangs right below that dip in your collarbone. Clasp is a little hard to manuever (and I don't have issues with any of my other jewelry), which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. <end>
 B00022C7NY  1/4 Carat Channel Set Diamond Earrings in 14k White Gold (with Safety Lock) ||	  Nice,but a bit pricey..  Bought them for my wife while on sale around $350 as I recall. They are well made and look very nice. I looked around at Macy's and a few other quality places and found similar items for as low as $250 on sale during the holidays. They were not identical, and I do like these a bit better.I do wish they were a little larger, but my wife thinks they are perfect. No regrets,and she loves them. I'm happy. No rip off's or junk. Glad I got em for her. <end>
 B00022C806  1/2 Carat Diamond Hoop Earrings in 14k White Gold (with Safety Lock) ||	  Will never get lost!  These earrings are amazing for someone who tends to lose jewelry a lot (that would be me). The double lock is such a simple idea, yet it makes the earrings absolutely secure in your ears. The little diamonds are not the greatest quality but they're sparkly enough and the little hoops are perfect for everyday wear. <end>
 B00022F4LQ  Sterling Silver Multi Color Evil Eye Bracelet ( 10mm ) ||	  Broke with in hours of wearing it  We bought this item as a Christmas gift. It was absolutely adorable...HOWEVER...with in hours of wearing this bracelet one of the "eye" charms had popped out and was lost. No excessive wear and tear...no nothing. This is an incredibly over-priced piece of jewelry!!! Even at the $15 (plus tax & shipping) that we paid for it. To make matters worse, because we ordered it a month before Christmas the 30 day return/exchange policy had expired. <end>  Not like the one shown but....  I thought I was going to get the opaque glass model but it is clear glass! WHICH IS AWESOME! It is very pretty and looks EVEN BETTER than the model  ) Love my evil eye bracelet! <end>  really nice  it was really what i expected it to be. the colorful glass beads bracelet is a perfect accent to my otherwise boring office wear. <end>  Beautiful Jewelry, Fast Shipping and Great Service  The jewelry was absolutely beautiful. My items arrived in no later than a day or two. Service was prompt and highly recommended. <end>  Great bracelet but broke fast  The bracelet arrived in a timely manner and I loved it! But two of the eyes broke off within a week of owning the bracelet. I also bought the turquoise color from the same seller and that one broke as well. I love the bracelets but I'm hoping to find someone to buy from who makes them of better quality. <end>  Thanks!  I am very happy with my Evil Eye bracelet. It is not only prettier than the picture but was received only 2 days after placing my order! Thanks so much!! <end>  Beautiful Product at a great price  I ordered two of the Sterling Evil Eye bracelets for my nieces. The bracelets were beautiful, well made, and loved by my nieces. They wear them everyday. <end>  gorgeous!  i bought this back in december for myself as a christmas gift from my son. It is even more gorgeous in person, i have received so many compliments. I would say i have only removed it at the most 3 times, and glad to put it back on. I believe in the "evil eye" therefore i believe in this bracelet!! <end>
 B00022G1WW  Elegant Round Wheat Ankle bracelet - JewelryWeb ||	  Still wearing today...  Got this as a gift for the wife. She still wears it daily today. The weave is very nice and different. Wish that I could find a matching necklace at a decent price. <end>
 B00022G7W6  14k Yellow Gold 10" 1.3 mm Lite Figaro Chain Anklet - O Ring Clasp - JewelryWeb ||	  Too long  Came un-hooked very easy. This item was longer than normal and I was unable to wear it. <end>
 B00022G8F2  Stunning Bizmark Ankle Bracelet - JewelryWeb ||	  Anklet just OK  The item arrive in good time and packed well. But for the price, a bit over priced. <end>
 B00022G8GQ  WG Rope Ankle Bracelet - JewelryWeb ||	  Very sexy  I bought this to replace a 14K gold yellow rope ankle bracelet I've had for years. My old one is 1/8" wide and heavy. This one is 1/16" and very dainty. I was hoping it would be thicker as far as millimeters, but for the price, I was pretty sure it would be smaller.It looks very nice on the ankle, sexy because it is thin and dainty. Again, for the price, it was definitely worth it. I don't know that I would have paid much more than $125 for it, but I'm quite happy and will keep it.I also bought a ribbed 14K white gold toe ring from them and I really love it. The two together really look great. <end>
 B00022NDLE  1/7CTW Three Stone Diamond Drop Pendant 10K White Gold ||	  Don't Buy It  My boyfriend ordered this pendant for me for Valentine's Day. What they sent him is 5mm longer (leaving more space between the diamonds), and I think it's actually only .1 carat, rather than .15. Maybe they sent the wrong thing, or maybe they're being dishonest. <end>
 B00022TQTW  Antiqued Medieval Sterling Silver DRAGON Pendant Charm ||	  Lovely dragon pendent!  I am a great fan of dragons. So, I was delighted to add another dragon pendent to my collection. Very nice! <end>  Smaller than expected and that was good.  This is a pretty subtle piece even though it's dragon. It looks high end and not costumy at all. <end>
 B00022TU2A  10kt. White Gold, 1/4 ct. tw. Diamond Wedding Set (Size 5.5) ||	  I love this wedding band  This was the wedding set that we were first married with. It is so pretty.

 B00023JMYU  2mm Sterling Silver 24" Diamond-cut Rope Chain Necklace ||	  Diamond-Cut Chain  Beautiful glowing chain. I purchased several in different lengths. You can wear alone or with a trinket. Love them... <end>  EXCELLENT Quality Diamond Cut Rope Chain 22"  This is a VERY nice necklace. its length is good and the bright silver color is amazing! No tarnish or and crimps in the chain. AWESOME BUY! <end>  2mm Sterling Silver 24" Diamond-Cut Rope Chain Necklace  Very acceptable, sturdy and pretty, no flaws, adds alot to the piece that hangs from it. <end>  SPARKLING, ROBUST CHAIN  Bought this for a plain sterling silver cross, and the contrast is lovely. The chain sparkles and is sturdy. The cross hangs at a perfect length on this 24" chain. <end>  Rip off.  I understand its not a lot of money for this chain, but to call it diamond cut. What a joke. I have it a few days now and theres no shine at all to it. Its just a grey rope chain.Items that are diamond cut usually gleam. Theres more shine to a grey crayola crayon than there is on this necklace.What a major disappointment. <end>  Just as Described  Bought this for my son for Valentines Day. He is 14 and wears in daily. Love the product would buy again. <end>  Sterling Silver Chain  I bought this to wear with a big silver locket that has an antique look and needed a heavy looking chain. This one is very pretty and it shipped to me super fast. I would buy it again! <end>  Chain 2mm sterling silver chian  Not good not what I want so do not get in touch with me less I get in touch or make right <end>  CHAIN  THE CLASP IS GREAT THE DIAMOND CUT LOOKS WONDERFUL AND THE CHAIN DOES'NT GET CAUGHT IN YOUR HAIRI WOULD RECOMMEND THIS AS A GREAT BUY FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS A 24&#34; CHAIN <end>  Perfect!  This chain was affordable and arrived fast. Chain is very nice and just dainty enough for a girl yet strong enough to hold a heavy charm. I bought this to hold a silver saint medal given to me by best friend for Christmas. It's perfect. <end>  It is beautifully shiny  I know there are ratings for this product that are not as favorable, but I truly love this necklace. It isn't as heavy as another rope chain that I have, but it fits the pendant much better. Others have commented on its lightweight, but unless you are planning on wearing it all day and night, around babies, or other occasions which would cause it to be constantly pulled on (and I don't mean a light tug), it is heavy enough for wear. <end>  nechlace  i was pleased to be able to purchase a neclace i could put over my head as i have arthritice in my fingers and can not do clasps <end>  Worked well with pendant  My wife likes longer chains for her pendants and this worked very nice with chocolate diamond pendant I got her for Christmas. <end>  Excellent Product!  I was very impressed with the quality of this chain. It is gorgeous and looks great with my favorite pendant! <end>  nice sturdy chain  The 2mm Sterling Silver 24&#34; Diamond-cut Rope Chain Necklace is just as described and it looks beautiful.The lengh is just right, too. <end>  Gift for husband  My husband loved this chain. I got it for him for Christmas and was so excited that I gave it to him early. This chain is of a medium thickness and super shiny. <end>  Love It.  A good quality chain, at an affordable price, I have worn in everyday since it arrived without any problems. It arrived ahead of schedule. <end>  necklace  ya i feel like i got a good deal on this and im very happy about it the clasp seems strong also <end>  2mm sterling silver 24"Diamond-cut Rope Chain Necklace  This necklace was a perfect fit for my mother.The chain that came with the Dragonfly pendant wasn't big enough at 18inches.So IOrdered this 24 inch necklace. Its nice and sturdy . Love it! <end>  Perfect length and thickness for me!  I bought this to replace a necklace worn with a pendant my grandmother gave me. I was concerned the length would be too short, since I wanted to take it off from around my neck without having to undo the clasp, and I was easily able to do so, so I can't attest to the durability of the clasp mechanism. I've been wearing this for a few months now everyday, and it's still holding up strong. I wear it while jogging and mountain biking, and it hasn't broken. There's no discoloration on my skin, so that's always a plus =) It isn't a super shiny polish, which is perfect for me. This isn't really for other people to see anyways, I wear it under my shirt. The diamond-cut pattern is simple yet elegant. I should note that when I received the necklace, it was kinked pretty bad, and it took some twisting and turning to smooth it out, but it's fine now. Overall, looks good, feels fine against my skin, and is sturdy. <end>  was happy until...  I find out later on 8/26/12 from Jeweler that this necklace is not Sterling Silver. They put a lobster clasp on necklace with 925 on it, and even the clasp is not!!! Very upset, sending it back. They make you pay postage and it goes to some person with a P.O. Box it's not even a company!!! I may be out postage but hopefully my comment and others will have you seriously consider another maker If you don't want to lose out on time and money. They said Sterling Silver, it is sooo not !!! <end>  Beautiful quality  I bought this for my husband and he thought it was gorgeous! It is super shiny, made sturdy and stunning! <end>  loved by all.  my girlfriend loved it! her friends loved it!and I loved it!it looks great with her rose quartz heart-shaped pendant(purchased seperately). ---chuxter--- <end>  PERFECT  BOUGHT TWO AS GIFTS FOR MY SONS, THEY LOVE THEM. GOOD LENGTH, SPARKLES AND NOT TOO THIN. <end>  very pleased  this neclace is wonderful! It doent get tangled up in my hair or anything.I would suggest it to anyone who appreciates quaity. <end>  Major disappointment....  I thought it was my best buy for I read a good reviews about the item. Until the day it was delivered. When I opened the box, saw a small piece of metal ripped off from the chain and there's just a piece of metal holding the both ends of the chain. Moreover, it is not sterling at all. I wore it for just a few days and its not gleaming anymore. A diamond cut usually gleam. This is NOT. I wish I could return the item but it is just a waste of time of sending this back and wait for the refund or replacement for more days. I am not just happy with the item. <end>  silver necklace  I FEEL THIS NECKLACE FOR THE LENGTH AND THE QUALITY WAS AN EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE PRICE, AND I WILL SHOP AT THIS SITE AGAIN. <end>  Nice!!  Bought for my wife. She really likes it. Has had it for several months. It is sturdy and looks nice. She has put a big cross on it and she gets many compliments. Great price. <end>  perfect for me  received very quickly and was so pleased. will definately order from this vendor again. <end>  Nice necklace  The necklace is nice for the price. Not as thick as I expected but still nice. <end>  radiant  I ordered this neck chain because some of the comments said it was smaller than they expected and that is exactly why I got it, I wanted a dainty gold chain and am very pleased. <end>  Help  Would this be.sent in the mailbox or by UPS?And would it come in a case Please someone answer quick im buying this for a gift soon <end>  Flimsy  Size and weight of chain are deceptive. You can get the same chain for less at TJ Maxx. <end>
 B00023JMZE  2mm Sterling Silver 16" Inch Box Chain Italian Necklace ||	  Good quality  This chain was beyond my expectation, the links are big enough and is top quality. Although I knew that it was 2mm I still did not expect such good quality.It is worth it. <end>  Like it.  Very happy with this, the links were not as close together that I would have, it's really hard to determine that 'when you are viewing the item on line. <end>
 B00023JO98  Sterling Silver Gothic Dragon Wrapped Cross Pendant ||	  Very nice detailled pendant  The pendant is exactly as seen on the picture, very good quality and detailled.I am extremly satisfied with my purchase and my husband love it. <end>
 B00023JOAW  Sterling Silver Jewish Star of David Charm Pendant ||	  Beautiful Star of David  The star was a bit larger than I expected, but it is beautiful and I enjoy wearing it. After searching the web for a Star of David, and being shocked at some of the listed prices, I was pleasantly surprised to find one of this good quality at such a reasonable price. I love it. <end>  star of david  the product was very nice and my son loved it. it seemed to be of good quality and came on a timely basis so we are very happy with it. <end>  Star of David  This was made very well. My wife was excited when she got it and thought it was very nice. I wish it would have had a chain to go with it. <end>  Very nice  I bought this pendant for my son and a different one for my daughter. The other one I bought for my daughter was promptly returned. This one was a much better quality item. I ordered a second one of these for my daughter. She loves it. My kids are teens and they wear their pendants constantly. I am extremely satisfied with my purchases. The pendant is thick, sturdy and shiny. This is definitely a unisex piece. The quality is great. <end>  It's OK - not bad at all.  The product was delivered quite promptly and I liked it for that. The craftsmanship was not as smooth as I thought it would be (from the picture presented on the product page). I tried to contact the vendor for explanation on this but never got any response. However, it's not too bad and it serves its purpose (I didn't buy it as a fashion item obviously), and I like it a lot.I ordered it with the 19" of New BLACK Silk Cord Chain (16", 19", 24") Sterling Silver Necklace which I found out was too long (for a person my size... LOL) - I tried to order the 16" one but that option was not available when I ordered. <end>  great!  im a girl and i got this for my birthday and i loved it! i wear it non stop and get compliments on it all the time, the only flaw would be that its edges are sharp, but it isnt really a problem. <end>  Going black....!  this Star of David is quite a nice item but why is it turning greyish black after only a couple of weeks of wear? Surely this is not supposed to happen with a stainless steel product? Or maybe it isn't stainless steel! the shine and the "clean" appearance of the product have become tarnished in absolutely no time at all.... so in a nutshell; nice but flawed! <end>  The giftee absolutely loves it  I purchased this for my nephew's Bar Mitzvah. He is an Israeli young man (now) who doesn't especially like jewelry. His Bar Mitzvah was yesterday & my sister just informed me that he really loves it. <end>  Excellent service and quality  I cannot give a seller feedback yet as that is the msg I am receiving from the Amazon feedback page, however, the Star is awesome quality for the price. I would order from Silver Insanity again in a New York minute! <end>  Well worth the small price!  I never expected this pendant to be so well made, at the low price I bought it for. It is much sturdier than you would think it would be...Simple, but beautiful!Sterling Silver Jewish STAR OF DAVID Charm Pendant <end>  Star of David  My husband was so happy with this Jewish Star as was I. It was everything I thought it would be based on the other reviews and the customer pictures. Thank you all. I'll continue to shop this way. <end>  Nice except a bit sharp. - 4.5 stars.  Overall, I like this very much. It is a good size and made very well. My only problem is that a couple of the points on it are a bit sharp and I worry that I'll get stabbed by them sometime. I am not sure how it would be fixed considering the size and the fact that I think it would look bad if the points were blunt. I would rate it 4.5 if that were an option. <end>  Beautiful  This pendant is totally gorgeous and well-designed. I got mine in the mail very quickly and the sterling silver chain I ordered with it too is ultra shiny! I love them both! If you are going to buy a Star of David, get this one you can't go wrong. <end>  Alright  Kinda small, no chain included.great shine and material. Its a little sharp so becareful.Its a good buy. <end>
 B00023JOB6  Sun, Moon, and Star Black Onyx Celtic Knot Sterling Silver Pendant ||	  Celtic knot pendant  Love the pendant , I bought the leather necklace with it. The only thing is that the loop opening for the pendant is to small for the clasp on the necklace. With a little modifying I got it to work and it looks great. Looks so much better in person. <end>  Have had this pendant for years  i was very surprised to come across this on Amazon as I bought it at a fair several years ago. I wear it with a fairly heavy dark silver chain from Mexico that is quite long so it balances out the size of it. I have never received more compliments on a piece of jewelry than I have for this. I love it. It has even appeared in my dreams! <end>  Beautiful, absolutely beautiful.  This is one beautiful pendant. It looks even better when you see it after it arrives. I am very pleased with this and I get a lot of compliments on it. Well made. Highly recommend this product. <end>  nice heavy pendant  This pendant was purchased as a gift. It is a nice heavy (not too heavy) pendant that is very well made. It has a nice big circle of black only attached to the celtic knot. I am pleased with both the appearance and quality. <end>  Very pretty & a good weight to it  Super fast shipping which surprised me. I usually get quick delivery with Amazon, but not so much with their partner sellers. It's a very pretty pendant and hangs well. My only complaint would be that I think this is a bit overpriced. A person can go to Michael's or Joanne's nowadays and find a plethora of pendant choices to make your own necklace with, and they're usually under $15. But I wanted this, so I bought it anyway! Very pretty,and I love it muchly! <end>  Black Onyx Silver Pendant  This is one of my favorite pendants. People notice it's an unusual design and really like it. <end>  VERY NICE  VERY NICE FOR THE MONEY. THIS A LARGE PENDANT, CAN ONLY BE WORN WITH CETAIN TOPS I GUESS...I PERSONALLY WANTED IT FOR MY ALTAR, IT'S SPECIAL TO ME, SO, I DO LOVE IT.FOR AROUND MY NECK, NOT SO MUCH....THE SAME FOR AN OAK TREE PENDANT I PURCHASED IN PEWTER, AGAIN I HAVE PLACED IT ON ONE OF MY ALTARS..BOTH PIECES BRING POSITIVE ENERGY TO MY HOME, SO, FOR ME THAY ARE PERFECT.....NAMASTE <end>
 B00023JOCA  Solid Sterling Silver Filigree Celtic Knot Earrings ||	  Beautiful Jewelry  I first came across the Silver Insanity line of Celtic jewelry last year, when I was looking for Christmas presents. Jackpot! I confess I spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items, both on Amazon and on the Silver Insanity website. The teardrop earrings I picked out were quite a success, so much so that I recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver Celtic knot earrings for myself. I've been very happy with my selection, and I just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend. I highly recommend the items from Silver Insanity, and plan to order from them again. <end>  Pleasantly Surprised  I originally wanted to purchase another pair of Celtic earrings, but Hollyinformed me a few hours later the pair I chose was out of stock. She immediately refunded my money. As soon as I found out the pair I had chosen was not available, I chose these as a second choice. They are very pretty. Just as described. Elegant. Simple. But not cheap looking.Well worth the price. They were packaged in a little zip lock bag andtucked inside a little velvet like pouch. Fine packaging for me. Theywere shipped securely and quickly. I am sure my daughter is going tolove them. I would definately purchase from Silver Insanity again.Excellent customer service. Excellent communications. <end>  Beautiful  Service was prompt and the earings are beautiful. I get compliments on them all the time and my sister asked for them on her birthday. <end>  A Gift for daughter  Earrings look better in picture than in person. While the design is lovely, they are very thin. First time I've ever been disappointed with anything I've ordered. <end>  Love these earrings  Had these on my wish list and received them as a gift. They are even more lovely in person. They are one of my favorite pairs - I wear them all the time. They're very simple, yet elegant, and very well made, especially for the price. I will definitely buy more from this company. <end>  Good job  I really like my earrings that I bought and they came in time. <end>  Solid, well-made, and a great seller  These earrings are lovely! They're solid and well-made, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them. Even better than I had anticipated, for a very reasonable price. Shipping was prompt. Very impressive seller! <end>  Beautiful  I got these for my wife for her birthday, and she absolutely loves them. They have this lovely curve to them, and the overall effect is somewhat viola-like. They seem to have a nice heft, and are just the right size. Big thumbs up! <end>  Well crafted  These are even better than I expected. Very well crafted, they feel great and are a good heavy piece of silver <end>  Very well made earrings  Received the earrings today and they are nicer than expected. Very well made and a size that can be worn by young or old and for any occasion. Very happy with purchase.Will be looking for more Silver Insanity products. <end>  quality jewelry  I bought these earrings for a gift. They arrived in just a couple of days. The quality is very good - a good weight silver and the detail is well done. I would not hesitate to order from them again. <end>  May not make it until Christmas  Purchased these for my daughter-in-law . . .but everytime I see them in my jewelry box they 'call my name' . . so who knows whose ears they will adorne? Guess I best order another set and be done with it! Love them. <end>  Love 'em!  These earrings are wonderful! They have a really nice, solid feel to them without being too heavy for my ears. I think they're really elegant. <end>  Solid Sterling Silver Filigree Celtic Knot Earrings  They are bigger than i expected but you won't notice that when you're wearing them, beautiful earrings <end>  Please  I purchased these earrings as a Christmas gift for my daughter and I liked them so much I would be inclined to buy a pair for myself. <end>  Great Earrings  An absolutely great pair of earrings! Nice change from the traditional Celtic knot design. Purchased as a gift and loved them so much I'm ordering a pair for myself. You can always count on Silver Insanity for quality and a great value. <end>  Beautiful earrings!  These earrings are a very nice design. They're lightweight but the silver dangle is a solid piece of silver, not wires. The dangle is curved in, not straight, in case anyone would want to know that. They're a good length - not extremely long or big but they are perfect for me. They're also not extremely wide. I would certainly recommend these. <end>  pleasant surprsie  These earrings are great value for money. Solid and have stayed shiny silver since I bought them, no tarnishing. They are now my favourite earrings <end>  Silver Filigree Celtic Knot Earrings  These sterling silver Filigree Celtic Knot Earrings were even more beautiful than they are pictured here. They are about one inch in diameter, and exactly as described. My oldest daughter received them as a gift this Christmas. She loved them. It would have helped to have the exact size listed in the description. <end>
 B00023JOMU  Italian 2mm Sterling Silver 20" Snake Chain Necklace ||	  Beautiful!  I like classic silver jewelry for everyday, but still like it to be unique & pretty. This is perfect. I may actually have it in the 22" length though. But thats another thing I liked. It's offered in quite afew lengths. Not too thin & very sturdy with nice weight. I've had it on almost everyday since I bought it over a year ago (along with a slightly shorter link chain I've also reviewed) & LOVE it! It's the perfect chain for a pretty pendant. I chose an initial pendant, which I've also reviewed, & it works perfectly. As usual, Amazon offers it at a fantastic price. Buy this, you won't be disappointed. <end>  Solid quality.  This is the real McCoy. If you need a 20" Snake Chain, this one will satisfy. <end>  Snaked by these chains  I bought two of these chains. They have a very nice look and feel to them, however BOTH of them broke within the first week of wearing them. If you are a regular guy like me, buy something more durable and stay away from these. (Buy these for your wife or girlfriend!!!) <end>  Snake chain necklace  The snake chain necklace is beautiful. It doesn't kink or tangle when worn with other chains. My daughter wears 4 - 5 necklaces at a time and she reviews it as the perfect chain! I will only buy this type of chain from now on. It looks great for an evening out on the town and for daily wear. Price is reasonable. Silver Insanity gets you the product quickly. <end>  Nice neckware  I generally like thicker pieces and for some reason I misjudged the size of 2mm. The chain is quite attractive and seems to be durable so far. I'm love snake chains but next time I'm gonna go 5mm instead. <end>  happy  i bought this for my husband because i was looking for a solid looking chain that didn't have the usual chain-link design. he loved it when i gave it to him and he wore it right away! <end>  Nice but too small.  The workmanship on this chain was nicely done but the diameter was too small. Suitable for a woman, but not a man. <end>  Turned black within a week  This product turned completely black the first week I wore it. I was very disappointed because it was very pretty when I received it. Not a good buy for me. <end>  Great necklace  I really like this necklace. It looks really nice and it is smooth. Just beware, it will snag you hair near the fastener...but it's a small price to pay to enjoy this necklace. <end>  great necklace  I bought this necklace so I could switch my pendants around. I like the 20" length. I love it. I get a lot of compliments on the necklace itself! I would highly recommend this chain necklace. <end>  good deal  After looking for a few months I decided to take a chance with this silver chain.I had bought a finer chain last year also from USA but it broke after 4 months. I chose the 2mm this time hoping it will be stronger.Time will tell but for now it looks great with my pendant.It arrived a week early. Couldn't ask for more. <end>  Beautiful chain. .  this chain arrived quickly and boy is it beautiful! I'm glad I purchased it. <end>
 B00023JP1A  Large New Sterling Silver Classic Etched Sewing Thimble ||	  Excellent Product and Service  As the title indicates, I was very pleased with this order. I highly recommend the merchant. <end>
 B00023JP1K  Large Sterling Silver Mens Gothic Cross Ring(Sizes 9,10,11,11.5,12,13,14) ||	  a masculine ring for someone who may not normally wear a ring  I first found, and bought, this ring in a booth at a large 'biker' event - Bikes, Blues and Barbeque - a fe years ago. I'd been wanting a ring for some time, but never found anything that appealed to my tastes - masculine but not gaudy or overbearing/overlarge. I've gotten numerous compliments on it from strangers....and was sad to let it go when a lady-friend asked for it as a keep-sake (lol).I missed it and wanted to replace it, but was skeptical that I could find anything that fit 'me' so well. I began searching Amazon under men's rings..and I was thrilled when I found the exact ring here.This ring actually even sparkles - glinting off the edges - in sunlight. I gave one to my best frined for his birthday the other day and his wife and daughters love it on him. <end>
 B00023JP4M  Sterling Silver Planet Stars Moon with Genuine Amethyst Pendant ||	  Really nice!  Item looks better in life than the photo on website. Nice sterling silver, and the ameythst ball in center is held safely in place with two prongs in the back. The pendant in diameter is the size of a nickel. Highly recommended item and seller - since the item is of good quality and the seller shipped the item quick! (I am a buyer of the item - not the seller, by the way!) <end>  Unique pendant  I bought this pendant along with the popcorn chain. I love it!! I have also gotten alot of compliments on it. It is very unique and of course I love purple and stars. I highly recommend this pendant and suggest if you buy a chain to go with it, a shinier one looks better. <end>
 B00023JP4W  Gothic Sterling Silver Large SPIDER Biker Ring Size 11(Sizes 10,11,12,13,14) ||	  Excellent Buy!  First & Foremost I'd like to thank Silver Insanity for selling such a wonderful item. I ordered this ring on the 16th of July and when I checked the tracking it listed that the estimated arrival would be on the 21st. When I came home tonight after a long day at a concert, I noticed that it came in the mail.Very fast delivery and excellent quality!!! I'm in love with the great detail that it provides, Just like the picture! I don't usually wear rings, but I think this will be on my finger for a long while. You get the beautifully designed ring along with a velvet (not sure if it is or not, but it's somewhat soft) pouch to keep it in when not wearing. Would possibly be a great Birthday or Christmas gift. I would recommend this to anyone who likes spiders or is into the Gothic Look.I FREAKING LOVE THIS RING!!!!  D <end>
 B00023JP5Q  Italian 2mm Sterling Silver 30" Snake Chain Necklace ||	  GREAT Gift!  I bought this as a special gift for my aunt. She loved it! The length is great and silver snake chains are hard to find in stores. You can't find them at this price if you do find them at all. GREAT chain. I need to get one for myself now. <end>  Nice!  I love this length, and it is a very pretty chain. I'm happy with it, and plan to get another, only thicker, from the same source, since I liked this one so well. Good quality, good price. <end>  Love love love it  First off. I love Amazon. I always shop here. And have never had a problem EVER. And I just received my new necklace from Silver Insanity. I bought a 30" snake 2mm. And it is beautiful. I will be a repeat buyer from this site. Thank You. <end>  good strong snake chain  I was looking for a snake chain stouter than the 1 mm one I had before. It also needed to be 30" as I'm a 6'3" man. Worked on both accounts and looks great. <end>  Great quality  Very nice quality, I am sensitive to poor quality jewelry, I have worn this for several months without any reaction. It is the perfect thickness for several pendants, or a larger one, I would buy again. Delivery was prompt. <end>  30" snake chain necklace  This is an excellent choice if you want a nice long chain to put a pendant on. It looks great and feels very nice to the touch. A good buy. <end>  Alright  Not macho enough for me to wear, I gave it to my sister. Didn't have it long enough to inspect the clasp, so I can't comment on it. <end>
 B00023JP7E  2mm Sterling Silver 16" Bead or Ball Chain Necklace ||	  good quality sterling chain  I love ball chains and I think that they are hard to find. I was very pleased when I found them on Amazon and very pleased when the 2 I ordered arrived. Very nice quality. Arrived quickly. <end>
 B00023JP7O  Sterling Silver Horse Head Cameo Photo Locket Pendant ||	  My Niece Received The Sterling Silver Horse Head Cameo  The seller of this item sent it to my niece as directed. Ufortunately I was unable to see the product first. What I saw and how it was described online encouraged me to purchase it.My niece called me when she got it .

Can not go wrong with this locket! It exceeded my expectations. Perfect for the horse lover. Beautiful! <end>  Displeased  i had purchased this item april 23, 2010. the same day i had ordered a necklace to go with it. i sent it to michigan, the date of expected arrival would be between april 27-may 5. by may 7 i contacted my friend who was suppose to recieve the packages. she informed me that she had gotten the necklace but nothing else. i contacted the seller to see where my package was. i recieved an e-mail saying they were going to fix my problem and get my package to its destination. by may 13 the horse pendant still had yet to be delivered. i contacted the postal service instead. i have gotten several phone calls from them and they all told me they were going to find my package. The post office was more helpful the the seller! the package has yet to be delivered. its been almost a month since i ordered the pendant. Word to the wise and to who ever buys this item, be cautious and i pray my problem wont occurr with you. <end>
 B00023JPBU  Green Aventurine Donut Lilypads with Detailed Frogs Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  FROG FRIEND  I love there forg earrings, but the wires are somewhat flimsy. I am afraid they will eventually break. <end>  adorable earrings  Everytime I wear these earrings people tell me how much they love them. They feel great on and are the cutest I have ever owned. They came very fast and I will buy from this company again. <end>  The best.  Though I own many earings, these are undoubtedly my favorite. I have recieved many compliments on them and they are hightly coveted by friends and family. They are the perfect size to be casual, but still very pretty. <end>
 B00023JPJC  Heavy 3mm Sterling Silver 30" Inch Snake Chain Necklace ||	  Great silver chain  Very pleased with this chain. Beautiful & very good quality. Picture does not do it justice. Received it sooner than expected. <end>  Bouquet for chain  I am very happy with my purchase especially as I have found it difficult to find a longish chain. Have a thickish neck & short chains enhance this. I looked in all my local jewelllery stores in Hobart, Tasmania & they didn't have longer lengths..... to my annoyance. Many on the internet were short, so I was pleasantly surprised that I discovered one on Amazon. Many thanks to the seller. <end>
 B00023JPLU  Hop Tu Naa Sterling Silver Celtic Birth Charm Pendant for November 17 - December 9 ||	  Celtic Birth Charm  I bought for a friend whose birthday is in November. However, when I received the charm, her birthday did not fall in the dates indicated. <end>
 B00023JPME  2mm Sterling Silver 16" Diamond-Cut Rope Chain Necklace ||	  happy with item  I love this necklace its well made and i can use in may different ways. I often change my necklace pieces so i like that it has many uses. <end>  Beautiful Chain  This chain is beautiful! I can't believe the amazingly low price, either. It is a perfect length for petite girls like me and is wonderfully crafted, with just the right amount of subtle sparkle to the rope design. I will be buying more of these for other pendants in the future. <end>  Beautiful  It really is a beautiful chain. Unfortunatelly it was slightly damaged when I got it, due to packaging, but it's not very noticeable. I've bought several items from Silver Insanity and I must say that I'm really happy and impressed with the service. I ordered this chain and two other items on the same day and Silver Insanity combined the order for me (without realizing it, I had placed the orders separately) saving me 15 dollars. <end>  Great Value for the price  This chain is a great value for the price. I was looking for a solid sterling silver chain and I managed to find one. <end>  shiny  ]  It was a bit smaller than i expected but the quality hasn't failed thus far.  ] I definitely recommend it for anyone thinking about buying it  0 <end>
 B00023JPMO  2mm Sterling Silver 22" Diamond-Cut Rope Chain Necklace ||	  Fantastic Quality  I have literally been wearing this chain every single day for a year and it has only needed cleaning once!I adore it. It is more than worth the price, and looks great with practically everything.[Edit April 2010] After four long years of wearing this chain constantly (including in the shower, the ocean, chlorinated pools... you name it) it finally broke yesterday morning. The chain itself is intact; what broke was the clasp. It's still as gorgeous as the day I bought it four years ago! Today I placed an order to replace it with the same chain. So to the question of whether it's durable... four long years of constant use (and some abuse) say yes. This is the best silver chain I have ever owned! <end>  Very pretty chain  This is a great chain for the money. It is very sparkly and shiney. Fast shipping from silver insanity as well. THanks <end>  Beautiful!  I received the necklace and was not disappointed. It is very shiny and beautiful. It seems fairly sturdy and I have not had any problems with it. I expect it to last a long time and stay as beautiful as it is now for many years to come. It was well worth the price. <end>  Excellent  I have a personally valuable pendant that came with a horrible chain piece that broke soon after purchase. So I was looking for an inexpensive alternative that wouldn't give me an allergic reaction (I'm extremely metal-sensitive), and wouldn't turn my skin green, but would also be secure for my pendant. I tried this one out, and have NO complaints at all. I've even received compliments about the chain, and my mom really wants to get one for herself. For the price, you CAN NOT GO WRONG!!! PS- for those who want to know, I wear this non-stop, in showers, to bed, to work, etc. That says a lot about this piece. <end>  i'll be back for more  wow! this necklace is everything other reviewers say and more. big enough to be worn alone. i too got this to put my pendants on because the chains that come with them are soooo tiny. get yourself a few of these. xmas is coming. i'm so happy. thanks silver insanity. <end>  best ever  I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction. <end>  Sterling silver necklace  Nice but not as thick as I thought it would be. Still nice for the price. <end>  Don't you just love a bargain?  I have dealt with silver insanity before, and the quality and value of what you get is beyond compare. I ordered two of these chains and they work well with both small and large pendants. The high quality lobster claw fastener is way better than those open loop ones that you'd probably pay twice as much if bought from a private store. Would definitely buy again! Thank You Silver Insanity! <end>  Nice chain  This is a great chain for your money. I only give this four star because I have a hard time closing the clasp together. Highly recomended. <end>  Awesome necklace, VERY shiny, NOT as thick as it looks!  I bought this necklace for a pendant I also purchased on Amazon. It is very shiny and made of quality silver. Definitely an eye-catcher!HOWEVER, it is not nearly as thick as it appears in the picture. Which is my fault for not paying attention to the '2mm' on the title!My warning is this  if you're a guy, this necklace is probably a bit too thin to fit your masculinity.And that is entirely based on my personal opinion. If thin rope necklace is your fad, and you're a man, so be it.Although I bought this chain for myself, since it wasn't thick enough I was able to use it for a pendant I bought my wife. It looks absolutely beautiful on her! <end>  SS Diamond-Rope Chain  Beautiful chain. The diamond cut makes it shine like white gold.Well worth the money. I would recommend this chain as a gift or treat yourself. <end>  Too kinked up..  The chain had 3 kinks in it that I just could not get out for fear of damaging or breaking the links. I returned it and received a fairly prompt refund. <end>  Alright.  I mean, I got this cause I got a pendant, but I don't wear either xD. I'll find use for it. Great service and quality nonetheless! <end>  thought it would be bigger  tarnished quickly and clasp broke within first week. way to thin connections.wish it would have stayed toghether.hope for a discount on a thicker chain? <end>  This Is Gorgeous!  I recently sent for this necklace. The delivery was prompt,and the necklace exactly matched the photograph of it. I liked the small invoice, which said to me that the people from Silver Insanity are environmentally aware and careful. The black velvet pouch and small ziploc plastic bag it came in were nice touches; very elegant. The necklace looks great with the sapphire pendant I placed on it; the two look as though they were made to fit together. I would certainly send for any jewelry item from them again. <end>  Great buy.  I am very pleased with this purchase. The necklace is very sparkly and looks & feels very nice. Looks great on my wife. She loves it. <end>
 B00023JPUQ  Silver Pewter GOTHIC SWORD OF JOTUN Pendant Necklace ||	  m.cisco  i like the sword necklace,its cool ,i diddnt buy one yet ,but if the 18 inch chain is to small,buy a 20 inch or 22 inch chain or the rope necklace. Now i would buy me pck of the long shoe stringany color will work. you can a make a shoe string necklace .i call this the hillbillie way . <end>  Necklace  The product itself is EXACTLY what I ordered. I ordered this as a replacement to the previous one I'd bought almost 10 years ago. The necklace itself is quality, however take precaution to not get it wet as the silver will wear from the copper material it is made from. Shipping was a couple weeks longer than promised, but overall really satisfied with my purchase. I would buy from this seller again! <end>  Nice Necklace  I ordered this item from amazon on Sunday, and it came in Wensday afternoon. I love this necklace, it looks cool, and everthing in the description is how it is. The only...not exacly problem, but thing I ran into was, my 8 year old brother had taken it off the chain (yes you can take it off/put on so it can be a mini sword  D) and started stabing a the ground(don;t know why) and it bent. Not much but just a little, so i bent it back into place, so now its fine. So you'd sorta have to be trying to bend to bend it, but besides that this is an awesome necklace, and even though it's chain is only 18 in. it still fits good. Over all its a great necklace. <end>  No wonder the price is only...  Now, Im not one to give out 1 star to just anything. I have bought many items through Amazon since around 2000 or so, but this one earned every point. First of all, the sword was discolored when I recieved it. It appeared to have a light yellow color to it. Next, the chain was too short. Even if you have a pencil neck, this chain would probably strangle you. Next, the elegant case was a cheap piece of plastic. Needless to say, this one went into the trash a few days after I recieved it. <end>
 B00023JPYC  Egyptian Wadjet SNAKE Silver Pendant Amulet Necklace ||	  better in person  very beautiful EGYPTIAN PIECEWORTH MORE THAN I PAID FOR IT AT AMAZON, HAD SEEN THIS SOMWHERE ELSE, FOR MUCH, MUCH MORE....THANKS <end>
 B00023JPZG  Runic Celtic Knot CROSS Silver-Tone Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Celtic Knot Cross Pendent - BEAUTIFUL  The necklace quality is above what I expected. My 16 year old son wears it daily. It was a gift for his confirmation. Even the chain is better than I had hoped. Very impressed with this item. <end>
 B00023JQ0U  Diamond-Cut 3mm Wide Sterling Silver 16" Figaro Chain Necklace Italian Made ||	  Nice...  I purchased this with the intent to give it to my boyfriend, but when I'd received it I realized it was WAY too small. I returned it in exchange for the bigger sized necklace. The necklace is very good quality and so far, no complaints. <end>  Perfect for a 4 year old  I struggled with which length and chain width to go with for my 4 year old son. This one is Perfect! He totally loves it! <end>  Diamond Cut Sterling Silver Figaro Chain  As soon as the packing was was open this chain began to tarnish. Yes I know silver tarnishes, but within 24 hours the chain was black (yes black).This is an indication of low quality silver, but sometimes you get what you pay for!!The style and construction of the chain is actually quite good. If you don't mind endless amounts of polishing, the chain is very attractive. <end>
 B00023JQ14  Diamond-Cut 3mm Wide Sterling Silver 18" Figaro Chain Necklace Italian Made ||	  A great chain!  I've been wearing this for about a week. It's beautiful, well-crafted, and, at 3mm, not glitzy but rather classic and understated. Excellent service and a very fair price. <end>  SS 18'' Figari Necklace  You will be pleased with this product; it has a great shine,clarity and weight to it. I would give this to a friend! <end>  not flashy,but nice  very nice for the $$$.will hold a cross,and miraculous medal with no issues.this was bought as a gift,but i would wear this chain myself.appears to be good quality. <end>
 B00023JQ46  Sterling Silver Large Elephant on Tan TIGER EYE Pendant ||	  Elephant Pendant with Tiger Eye is classy  This is a beautiful pendant I bought for my 17-year old daughter who is into elephants. She loves it. Also, great delivery time; it came long before the projected delivery date. <end>  Very Unique!  I bought this for a gift and it is perfect. The tiger's eye is not quite as bright as I was expecting, but it suits the piece nicely. The elephant has beautiful details. Its perfect for an elephant lover! <end>
 B00023JQ5U  Sterling Silver 6mm Wide Omega Chain 18" Collar Necklace ||	  Well priced omega  I wanted one of these necklaces to display slide pendants, or wear alone, and I found this one to be a reasonable price. It's not quite as rigid as I expected, but it's beautiful and looks great on. <end>
 B00023JQ6Y  Thick 5mm Wide Sterling Silver 16" Snake Chain Necklace 26gram ||	  Makes a quality statement  This is a beautiful chain, thick and not gaudy. I've had it for over a year. The only problem I've had is that bails need to be made the right size and shape to take the chain. Silver Insanity makes very nice pieces that fit this chain, and so do Mineral Miners. The bail needs to be the right shape (not a big silver circle) in order to lie properly. Also, the bail does not look huge when it is made right. I got a moonstone pendant from Silver Insanity that fits this chain perfectly, and it is a great example of a bail done right. Doesn't look big at all, but obviously is big enough. The chain looks fabulous with a beautiful pendant on it, and magnifies the beauty. <end>  Disappointed  It said 5mm. Didn't say it was completely round. And no way does it fit like a 16 inch necklace. It fit like a choker and NOTHING will fit on it because it's too thick! I am going to try to return it. <end>
 B00023JQ8C  LARGE Silver CELTIC CRUX CROSS Crystal Pendant Necklace ||	  not satisfied  Pendant looks mass produced, gems look cheap and necklace is also cheap. Thought product would have been of better quality for the price. <end>
 B00023JQIC  Sterling Silver Rose Real MAGNIFYING GLASS Pendant ||	  nice piece  The pendant looks exactly as it does in the photo, except that the glass is clear, not pink. I marked it down one star because the image here made it look like like rose quartz or something similar; if I had known the glass was clear, I might not have purchased it. However, it's an unusual piece plus it's pretty and well-made (all things I look for) so I will definitely wear it a lot. It really is about 3 inches long so if you are looking for something the size of a charm bracelet charm, you should keep looking. <end>
 B00023JQYG  Frogs Sterling Silver Sewing Small Red Pin Cushion ||	  Very small  This product was MUCH smaller than expected. The product picture is misleading. It is about the size of a thumb nail and red not blue. Despite this I decided to keep th product for its cuteness. <end>
 B00023JRP4  Sterling Silver Mother of Pearl MOP Teardrop Pendant ||	  Beautiful but with scatches  The pendant arrived way before the delivery period so that was a pleasant surprise considering I am in the Southeast Asia region. It is a beautiful pendant but it had scratches on the silver surface area surrounding the pearl. It's obvious unless you look at it from a reasonable distance. For that reason it could be priced a little cheaper. Was going to give it to my boss for her b'day but quite embarrassing with the scratches  ( <end>
 B00023JSAS  Victorian Style Sterling Silver Table Salt Spoon ||	  tiny but perfect  Tiny little silver spoon, not old at all but adorable! I was expecting something bigger but was actually quite happy to get this one, since I'd also wanted something small enough to compliment an old silver-plate mustard cellar for a while now. <end>
 B00023JSBW  Large Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Hook Dangle Earrings ||	  Nice  A little smaller and lighter than I expected but very nice. Made in Thailand so I worry about the labor source but I'm keeping them. <end>  Just beautiful!  I am so pleased with these earrings! I started shopping around for other sterling silver earrings in the brick and mortar stores after I placed this order because I was getting a little nervous about whether they'd arrive on time (I needed to have them by 12/22). There is just nothing out there that compares with these! The cost was reasonable; the silver is actually sterling silver, and the quality and workmanship is great, very lustrous, no rough edges or thin areas. The size is neither too large nor small, and the design is very unusual; nothing I had seen in the stores comes close in uniqueness. I only wish I had purchased another 2 pairs to give as another Christmas gift and one for myself. Don't hesitate in buying these if you think you or someone you know might like them! <end>  Very pretty  Got these in the mail today and was pleased with the quality. These earrings aren't cheap thin little things they actually have a little weight to them and have a very nice mirrored finish. <end>  Delicate and pretty  It's a beautiful celtic style silver jewelry. Just loved it. I was expecting a little bit bigger earrings, but it looks great. <end>  Lovely Earrings, and fast shipping!  I bought these to match a pendant that had already been given to me. The earrings are well made, light and very pretty! Also, I recieved the items before the estimated date, and that always makes me happy~ I would buy from them again. <end>  Excellent service  I ordered these earrings on a Sunday, and by Wednesday it was in my hands. I like the black velvet bag it comes inside, and the earrings themselves were in great shape. Not quite as round as they looked (more a vertical oval) but just as pretty as I thought they'd be. Next time, they're going to me mine, not just a gift for someone else. <end>  great!  These earrings are a bit larger than I would normally wear since I have rather small ears but they look great and aren't too heavy. The quality is better than I expected. I am thrilled with this purchase and will buy from Silver Insanity again! <end>  Love the celtic...  The earrings arrived in 2 or three days, and I did not pay much extra for the shipping. They arrived in good shape(all shiny and new looking), packaged well in a little plastic bag as well as a cloth pouch. Very happy with this order. <end>  Lovely Earrings!  I am so happy with these earrings! They are made beautifully, light weight and shiny. And they are marked as 925 sliver. I love them and can recommend them highly. I've already gotten several compliments on them. <end>  Celtic Hoops  This is beautiful pair of earrings. Brilliant shine, not heavy and a great size. Very enjoyable to wear and they gather compliments. <end>  Celtic Know DangleEarrings  The dangles are just the right size and length. They are light to wear, but have enough weight that they stay in place. They go with just about any kind of clothing-from jeans to dresses. <end>  Great Earrings  I absolutely love these earrings. Very well made, beautiful design and a lot of silver! <end>  ...  Absolutely beautiful... possibly the best set of earring I own. Looks great with everything, and looks great with different hairstyles. It also catches the sun really well and looks pretty because of the celtic knot. If you are planning to buy this item because you like it from the picture, I suggest you buy it without a doubt. They're the perfect size, and they look just like they do in the picture. I'm very happy with my purchase =) <end>  A Great Buy!  I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I took a risk, I thought the silver wasn't going to be sturdy but the earrings are super sturdy and well-made. They're also very light, lighter than I expected but they add a great finishing touch to any outfit. A great buy! <end>  Celtic Knot Hoops  These Celtic Knot Hoop Dangle Earrings arrived before Christmas. I gave them to my two daughters who like to collect Celtic Jewelry. They both loved them. They are unusual and very elegant. They were also the size I expected them to be. Great product! <end>  elegant and interesting  These classy earrings look good either in the office or out on the town. They are medium sized, large enough to be seen even if your hair is thick and long, but not so large that they overpower. The simple Celtic design complements a variety of clothing and hair styles. The earrings are also comfortable to wear all day. I've worn these many times over the past few months and they remain in perfect condition -- no problems with tarnishing or discoloration. Wear them at work with a soft dress for a relaxed, yet professional look. Or, try them with a sexy black top and see if they do not make your man a little crazy! <end>  well-made celtic earrings  I was pleased how quickly the earrings arrived and with the quality of the earrings. <end>  Silver Earrings  I love these earrings. I have had so many nice complements. I tell everyone I got them at Amazon, and to check out the maker, Silver Insanity, as well. I also liked the little tarnish-resistant pouch the earrings came in-a really thoughtful touch. <end>  I wear them every day  I received these earrings as a birthday gift about nine months ago and I wear them everyday and everywhere. They are light but never fall off and go with any kind of outfit from church to jeans and a t-shirt. <end>
 B00023JSDA  Sterling Silver Goddess Celtic Knot Garnet Necklace ||	  Garnet Necklace  The quality/workmanship of the necklace is very good. I bought this for my daughter's birthday. She likes the looks of the necklace off, but has never worn it because it doesn't lay just right on when it is around her neck. <end>  Beautiful necklace that I get many great comments on.  I sleep with this necklace and I am hard on jewelry...it still has not broken.I love it. <end>  A very nice necklace!!  This was a really nice piece and made a lovely gift for a family member.Shipping was also very fast and they communicate well.Also please note I gave this to a beautiful older woman who very much appreciated it and was immediatly told by her 21 year old daughter that she would be borrowing it often.Point  Enjoyed by all ages.My only complaint was that there was no box, it came in a plastic bag and I had ordered about 15 pieces that I needed to get boxes for very quickly.Other than that I would HIGHLY reccommend this seller and this piece. <end>  Not Quite as Nice as Image  The image really looks much better than the actual product. Stones are quite brownish, not red as one would expect of garnet. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this. <end>
 B00023JSEO  Gothic Sterling Silver Large SPIDER Biker Ring Size 10(Sizes 10,11,12,13,14) ||	  Excellent Buy!  First & Foremost I'd like to thank Silver Insanity for selling such a wonderful item. I ordered this ring on the 16th of July and when I checked the tracking it listed that the estimated arrival would be on the 21st. When I came home tonight after a long day at a concert, I noticed that it came in the mail.Very fast delivery and excellent quality!!! I'm in love with the great detail that it provides, Just like the picture! I don't usually wear rings, but I think this will be on my finger for a long while. You get the beautifully designed ring along with a velvet (not sure if it is or not, but it's somewhat soft) pouch to keep it in when not wearing. Would possibly be a great Birthday or Christmas gift. I would recommend this to anyone who likes spiders or is into the Gothic Look.I FREAKING LOVE THIS RING!!!!  D <end>
 B00023JT5C  Dancing Birds Slider Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Pendant ||	  Great!  I love this pendant. It came before the estimated delivery date, packaged nicely and has nothing wrong with it. It is also a great size and hangs nicely on a leather cord. <end>  Gorgeous Dancing Birds  Love this piece of jewelry. It is complimented well by a short leathernecklace or silver chain <end>
 B00023JTA2  Sterling Silver Marcasite Emerald-Cut Synthetic 7x9mm Amethyst Post Earrings ||	  BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS  I was thoroughly thrilled with these art deco maracasite earrings. They were all I expected and more, & am looking forward to wearing them on many more occasions than just the special one that I bought them for. <end>  Siver Marcasite Emerald Earrings.  They are the right size but everybody notice them. They are beautiful is a great, great buy. <end>  Fantastic gift to a friend!!!  The earings co-insighted with a necklace that was given to a friend of mine who absolutely loved it! <end>  Review  I was very pleased with the quality and delivery.With what I've purchased through Amazon on other occasions, I've been very pleased. <end>
 B00023JTAM  Sterling Silver Marcasite and Black Onyx Cross Pendant ||	  Poor Craftsmanship  I bought this pendant around Xmas and I was quite disappointed when I received it. It was poorly constructed.The Black Onyx is stuck on with glue to a base made of silver. The first fault I noticed was a crooked cross. This was because the Black Onyx wasn't aligned properly when it was stuck to its silver base. Traces of glue were left stuck on the sides of the Black Onyx which I had to clean off. The silver at the back also had some stain spots. It looks much better on the net than it does in real life. It was it bit embracing to give this cross as a gift hoping the person didn't recognise the faults which were quite obvious to me. <end>  Beautiful Item but cheaply made...  I loved this cross its beautiful. But after 2 days of wear one of the onyx bars fell out. All I did was wear it and it fell out. Which tells me it was made very badly. For beauty I'd rate this cross a 5 out of 5. But overall because of poor craftsmenship I have to rate this a 1. I wish this was a better made product because I really do love it. I hope this helps someone to not waste their money unless they plan on only displaying it and not wearing it. <end>  Mr Loaf  Yes, the cross is quite delicate and prone to breakages, but this is a piece of jewlery and not a toy. I have had mine for several years now. I always remove mine last thing at night for safe keeping. <end>  bad quality on this pendant  this is the second black onyx pendant that i have odered. the first one was a beautiful 5 star item. my son misplaced it so we ordered it again because it was such a nice cross. this time it was very poor quality or else just a faulty item. two parts of the black onyx fell off the cross.i would like to have it replaced if possible. patty wade <end>
 B00023JTQ6  Faery and Hummingbird on Genuine Rose Quartz Sterling Silver Pendant ||	  Accurately depicted  This pendant was accurately depicted both visually and in description, seemed well-constructed. Received as stated. More than I would normally pay as a wholesale buyer and jewelry creator. Overall, satisfied with this item. <end>  Very nice.  I bought this for my adult daughter. She likes unique jewelry with natural stones and this was perfect. She loved it. It's very pretty. The cost was affordable. <end>
 B00023JTR0  Sterling Silver Medieval Winged Knight Rider on Horse Pendant with Genuine Blue Sodalite ||	  update on earlier review  Since writing my earlier review, the seller has contacted me, fully refunded my S&H; cost to return the damaged item, and I've already received a beautiful replacement. The seller has made everything right and in decent time. I would deal with this seller again.The pendant itself was beautiful. the silver horse and winged knight rider were beautifully crafted and the circular stone disk was beautiful except that it contained a tiny chip in the edge of it. i'm inclined to think the chip was present during the creation or assembly because the inside area of the cut appeared to be polished. I decided i wanted a perfect pendant, not one with a chip in the edge of it so I returned it and am hoping for a replacement.I've sent two emails to inquire about a replacement (the first email i sent about 5-6 days ago) and as yet have received no reply to either one. In addition, they sent me a defective pendant. i beleive it was chipped when they packaged it and sent it as is anyway. One final note  i had to pay the return S&H; on it and the seller's return policy provided on the Amazon site indicates that i will be reimbursed for S&H; within a range of .60 - $2. That's a laugh. Sending it the cheapest possible way via US Postal Service, it cost me $5.40. <end>  Beautiful  I purchased this as a gift and am really hoping he is as pleased with it as I am. Love it! <end>  fabulous product, simply kooshtiness  I've been wearing it as a necklace for months, can't even go out without hanging it in my neck. Looks gorgeous and reflects my style towards public. <end>  greatness  excellent seller. they even worked with me on some issues with shipping at no extra charge. <end>  horse-celtic fans  my mother in law who is a big horse and celtic fan was very pleasd to recieve this unusual gift. <end>
 B00023JTZW  Sterling Silver Coiled Dragon on Black Onyx Pendant ||	  Dragon Pendant  i love this neckalce i have had it for five years now and it has lasted perfectly.the craftsmanship is wonderful very durable. i suggest it for anybody who likes dragons. <end>  NIce pendant...  Nice look, good construction. The finish is okay (look as if it has been handmade, quickly. Lots of glue keeping everything together.) Nevertheless   completly satisfied with it. <end>
 B00023JU0G  Sterling Silver Pentagram or Pentacle on Genuine Blue Sodalite Pendant with Sun, Moon, and Stars Pattern ||	  Very Nice  I got this in the mail last night - it's a great piece. The design is great and it's a good size. Overall, it's very striking. However there is one slight issue - the stone and the pentacle are very loosely attached, so it rattles. Loudly. So, bottom line is that it's a nice piece of jewelry but not quite right if you're looking for something for (inconspicuous) everyday wear. <end>  Beautiful Piece- Subtle way to show your beliefs!  I love this piece, and get remarks on it all the time, from wiccans and non-wiccans alike. It was larger and more attratctive than I had expected; I never take it off! <end>  Excellent buy.  When I first received the package in the mail, I was pleased to find everything well protected and boxed nicely. Upon cutting open the box, I found the pentacle inside a black velvet bag, which was kind of a nice surprise even if the bag was sorta cheap. Anyway, after pulling out the pentacle I found that it is actually very visually pleasing and not as cheaply made as some of the reviews make it out to be. It does however, rattle very softly, but that is an easy fix you can do by bending the clip that holds the stone in. It is moderately weighted and I find it comfortable for daily wear. Honestly, I love it and I'm really glad that I bought this pentacle in particular instead of one of the plain punched steel ones. It has a lot more character and the stone is beautiful by itself. The pentagram is well made and the details on it's face are clearly visible. I'm already really fond of it and I do plan to wear it everyday. Blessed be. <end>  Stunning!  Got this yesterday and it is STUNNING! I have read other reviews that complained about the metal scratching the stone, and I cannot comment on that aspect yet, as it is new, but it is just gorgeous! I am wearing it today for the first time. I love it!Shipping was extraordinarily fast, and it was packaged very well. I highly recommend!!! <end>  Change of heart  I bought this and originally thought it was junk. I have changed my mind about this now. It is a great piece to use in circle work. <end>  Not worh the price  I was so excited when I received this pendant until I noticed the poor quality and to top it off the stone and the pentacle are very loosely attached, so it rattles. <end>  Best investment for those out of the closet  When I looked at the product online, I was afraid the stone and pentacle would be securely attached. Being attached or melded into a single piece hinders the flow of energies in this piece. Finding it loose and able to move freely, with ease of repair should either portion break is a great plus in my opinion. I never just "throw out" broken jewelry, especially not a religious piece such as this. Should the stone break, I can purchase a replacement, fitting it in nice and neat with little bending to the metal portion. Should the sterling silver bend and break off, I can have it repaired by a jeweler/crafter.It gets four stars only because the metal rubbing against the stone scratches the surface and the only drawback to the design.All in all, this one piece of jewelry gets more complements than any other piece in my collection. I don't mind being noticed. Don't search this type of jewelry out if you want to keep to the shadows. <end>
 B00023JU0Q  Sterling Silver Celtic Knotted Heart on Rose Quartz Pendant ||	  Sterling silver Celtic Heart Pendant  Just Bought this Pendant and its absolutely beautiful!! High quality and such an affordable price!! Already getting compliments on it and people asking where i got it from!! Thankyou for this beautiful Item  -) <end>  beautiful and sturdy  got this last year for my wife for xmas. she LOVES it and wears it everywhere. It's nice thick quality silver too, not super thin like you usually see in this price range. Great buy and the picture doesn't do it justice. She gets compliments on it all the time. <end>
 B00023JU88  Sterling Silver Amethyst and Marcasite Cross Pendant ||	  Very Nice  The Amethyst cross was just as beautiful as on line. It was a gift and they just loved it! Very fast delivery <end>  Pretty but cheaply made  I receive this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend.This is my birth stone so I love amethyst,unfortunately I had to return due to a stone falling out after wearing it only 2 weeks.The stones are a lite shade of purple,not dark Africa amethyst & cross is pretty but cheaply made.I returned this item and choose not to have it replaced.I gave it only 2 stars cause it is pretty but not made well.Buying beware. <end>
 B00023JUA6  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Amethyst Drop Necklace ||	  Very nice and Looks Beautiful on my Wife  I ordered this for my Wife's Birthday for Feb 1st. Ordered it on Jan 21st and received it on Jan 23rd. The picture doesn't do this piece justice. The design is simple and classy and can be worn with just about anything. The Amethyst is not gaudy or sticks out like a sore thumb. Beautiful and elegant and very pleasing. <end>
 B00023JUBK  Marcasite Red Garnet Filigree Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Marcasite Red Garnet Filigree STerling Silver Earrings  Much bigger than I expected them to be - they look more costume-y than elegant, but they're still cute. <end>  garent earnings  I thought the earnings were reasonably priced and the quality was nice for said price. It was a gift and it could have been packaged better than a little zip bag. <end>
 B00023JUMY  Vintage Styled 4cttw Genuine Garnet Sterling Silver Marcasite Square Brooch Pin ||	  Lovely Brooch  This was a Christmas gift for my mother. The brooch arrived well within time for Christmas and was packaged in a lovely gift box. The brooch itself was true to its photo and very pretty. Would buy from this seller again. <end>  Looks vintage and gets compliments  I wanted to get myself a little something to go with a garnet ring and earrings I had received. This brooch caught my eye and I knew the garnets would be a nice match for a red-and-black ruana I sometimes wear to work (it's like a shawl/scarf). I was right and I've gotten lots of compliments on this little item. It's got a great vintage look but plenty of shine, without looking too gaudy or big for everyday wear. It fits right in with other pieces that came to me as inherited jewelry and that's especially nice. I'd definitely buy from this seller again because the quality and the value are excellent. <end>
 B00023JUN8  Vintage Style Sterling Silver Marcasite Choker Necklace ||	  Macasite heaven  This piece of jewelry is more stunning on, than photographed. Although I expected it to be a little bit larger - it is fine the way it is. I love wearing it with matching earrings I found on the same website. <end>  A bit smaller than expected... & UPDATE 7/28/11  It is made well, is as beautiful as in photos, just a bit smaller than I expected. When wearing it, I'm not sure it lays properly on me, but overall gave it a 4, because of proper packing, and great workmanship. It definitely looks antique, and have had a few compliments.UPDATE  07/28/11- I have owned this since Xmas of 2010, now about 7 months... I have worn it about 5 or 6 times now, never in water or crazy activity, and when I went to put it on yesterday, the connection to clasp broke open and the chain tumbled down my neck... Luckily, that happened at home, before leaving the house, so i did not lose it, but am disappointed in the quality of the silver connection. Upon inspection ( I make jewelry, myself ), the part that broke open was thin and not adequately joined. I have replacement parts and can eventually repair it myself, but I could not wear it out to my husband's birthday dinner, and now i have to find the time to fix it. <end>  Beautiful choker  I purchased marcasite earrings too and the combination looks great! I like that the necklace is a shorter length, more a choker size. It stands out and I've gotten several compliments! <end>
 B00023JUO2  Sterling Silver FAIRY on Rose Quartz Prism Pendant ||	  Rose quartz not rosy  I bought this pendant because of the rose quartz, what I got was regular quartz. So I wasn't impressed with the crystal, but the picture of the fairy is exactly what you get. The chain was a lot nicer than I expected. I wish they would show a picture of the chain. You have to order it at checkout and they don't provide a picture. So I was pleased when it turned out to be a nice small link chain instead of the cable you see pictured with the pendant. So if you order this pendant, don't expect a dark rose quartz, you might not get it. But otherwise the pendant is very nice. <end>  Neat!  The pendant is very nice. It got to my home town in Mexico City in perfect conditions. Thank you. <end>
 B00023JUUG  Large Sterling Silver Fairy Slide with Amethyst Drop Pendant ||	  good size  not real small, the fairy it's self is aout the size of bottle cap and the detale is just whats shown. The face isn't over detaled but its still prity. <end>
 B00023JV4G  Neat Sterling Silver Fish Hook or Fishing Pendant Charm ||	  Silver Fish Hook  My husband loves to fish, so when I saw this I had to get it for him. It is real nice and the picture does not do it justice. My husbands loves it. Great Price also. <end>  Quality craftsmanship  I am pleased with the craftsmanship of thip piece. For the price I was expecting something of lesser quality. I was wrong! This is a good weight piece and compaired to other pieces I just have seen in Hawaii costing a lot more, this one is just as good. Give it proudly to the fisherman/ woman you know. I got it for myself along with the cord that is suggested. <end>  Years Of Awesomeness  I bought this pendant from Silver Insanity YEARS ago....And today, after not having been cleaned or properly stored (truck driver and an avid promoter of clutter), it's still shiny as ever.It's one of my favourite necklaces to wear. It's pretty unique and attracts a lot of attention. It's off-beat and yet elegant enough to wear with even the fanciest of dresses (just make sure you have a fancy chain to hang it on!)And staying power? Heck yeah. <end>  Very pleased!  I received this pendant today in the mail and am very pleased with the look. It was a lot larget than I expected and the details are very nice. It was shipped and received in the time that the company promised, so needless to say I am very pleased with this product! <end>  pretty cool  I'm very happy with my purchase of this pendant. It caught my interest because I'm an avid recreational angler. It's a nice piece of jewelry for the price and bigger than I thought it would be (about 1 1/4" long) without looking obnoxious. Also the shipping was speedy and I received the item a full day before the estimate. I'd recommend this as a nice gift for the fisherperson in your life. <end>  Great Service  I live in Kenya and ordered this for my own use. I wasnt sure they would actually ship it to Africa but was pleasantly surprised when I received it in record time! Silver Insanity and Amazon Thank you.The pendant is awesome and bigger than i thought. I plan to do all my shopping from here now. Its much cheaper and get better variety/choice from here! <end>  He loves it!  I ordered this pendant for my finace. We are always fishing, hunting, mud riding, and doing stuff outside so I knew this would be the perfect one for him. He is 20 and he loves it. I didn't order the suggested chain because he wanted one that would lay more flat so I got a linked chain which is great! The charm is small enough that it doesn't bother him but big enough that it looks good from far away. He never takes it off (including in the shower) and after 2 months it still looks great. For the price I wouldn't be too upset if it did get discolored and I had to replace it, but so far so good. Great product, I'd definately recommend. <end>  Nice  This is a nice piece, but smaller than I thought it would be and is not solid. I bought it for my husband and a leather braided rope-it wouldn't fit the rope, he had to carefully widen the hoop, so I sent for the Winged Phoenix Pendant...that was perfect for the leather braid, but the hook, he doesn't even wear it, may be better for a kid but much to small for a man. It is pretty and worth the price, but as I said its hollow and very light and not very big. I love Silver Insanity though, and have bought many items from them and this is the first thing I have been disappointed with. <end>
 B00023JVBE  Sterling Silver Medieval Medallion with Genuine Blue Lapis Pendant ||	  Beautiful  Incredibly beautiful item. Has patina, personality, class. It is extremely well build. I bought it for all these reasons and I was not disappointed when I received it. Everyone around me admired my new pendant and wanted to know where I acquired it from. I am very pleased with my acquisition, it is now one of the most beautiful pendants I own. <end>
 B00023JVBO  Sterling Silver Lady in the Flower Garden Pink Rose Quartz Slide Pendant ||	  Silver Lady  Lady of the garden pink rose pendant. I really like the pendant, but wish it was larger. <end>  Beautiful  The pendant is a lot smaller than the picture, but just as beautiful. I adore it! I just got it in the mail, and I can't wait to wear it. <end>
 B00023JWAO  Large Sterling Silver Egyptian Nefertiti Queen Cleopatra Pendant with Genuine Amethyst Healing Crystal ||	  Good ornamental piece with blend of history.  Hi,this is very good pendant to wear,its sturdy enough and it gives u the feeling of Egypt.Excellent design and too cool to wear. <end>
 B00023JWIQ  Sterling Silver Denim Lapis and Onyx Reversible Pendant ||	  smaller  The pendandt, although very beautiful, was smaller than I had expected. The photo made it appear so much larger. But the main issue that I had with the piece, was that the pendant spune too freely. It would never lay flat on either the denim lapis side, or the onyx side. I haven't hardly worn it for that reason. <end>
 B00023JWJ0  Sterling Silver Elephant Spinning Spin Band Ring Size 7(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  fantastic "fiddle" ring  I bought this ring after reading that spinner rings had helped others finally stop biting their nails. I've always heard that one habit would have to be replaced by another; a likely key to past failed attempts.This ring has surpassed my expectations. I leave it on day and night including showers and hand washing. It still looks great and hasn't tarnished a bit. I just ordered additional ones for a friend and for my daughter.This ring is wider than what I usually wear, so I'd advise ordering one size larger than you normally wear. <end>  Just as advertised  Exactly what I wanted in a spinner ring. Detail is true to picture and the spinner spins freely. I like that it is a bit narrower than most spinner rings. <end>
 B00023JWWW  Sterling Silver Round Plain Classic Locket Pendant ||	  Lovely locket with clasp issues.  This is a lovely locket. It's the perfect size and shape, and people admire it for its attractiveness. Unfortunately, it doesn't close very well. There's a gap between the two sides of the locket when it's closed, and it doesn't "click" shut the way a normal locket would. It will occasionally open on its own. I've tried manipulating the metal piece that should allow it to stay shut, but it hasn't really been helping. <end>
 B00023JXSK  Silver-Tone Pewter Egyptian Ankh with Blue Crystal Pendant Necklace ||	  So-so  The photo of the piece is not very accurate. The true color of the inner part of the Ankh is dull gold while the outer lines are silver. The blue crystal is also not as bright, and is actually a sort of dark blue.Wasn't very happy when I received the package, as I was expecting a purely silver piece. The overall make of the item isn't bad, though I wish they would lay off the brightness/contrast when cleaning up their item photos. <end>
 B00023JXSU  Large Gothic Zotz the Bat Danger Amulet Pendant Necklace ||	  Good quality  not so big not so smallPerfect size I would say, goes well with dark clothes of coursethe Material is pretty good, it if gets dark then just polish it a little bit and that will be all <end>  Bought this for my granddaughter for Holloween 2011  got this for my granddaughter for Holloween 2011, she loves it and can hardly wait for the big night. <end>  Bat Pendant Necklace  I bought it for a Halloween costume, it's large sized, good quality, nice looking. Not a cheap piece of crap, I've bought a lot of jewelry from Silver Insanity and have never been disappointed in the quality of what they sell. It is PEWTER and not silver but still nicely detailed. <end>
 B00023JY1Q  Sterling Silver Venetian Glass Millefiori Heart Pendant ||	  fair price  I have bought many items from Silver Insanity for myself and my daughter. The service and quality were always five star. The Millefiori jewelry is expensive everywhere online. You can not find it cheaper than $30 for a piece like that anywhere. In fact, for a heart this size you are likely to pay closer to $50 elsewhere. I have seen many pieces that I paid for under $20 with Silver Insanity, sold much higher in the stores. I think their prices are shockingly cheap and allow me to indulge my 6 year old with high quality silver trinkets. <end>  RIP-OFF?  THIS PIECE OF JEWELRY WAS VERY PRETTY AND FIT THE DESCRIPTION PERFECTLY-THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM. SOMEONE HAD NEGLECTED TO TAKE A PRICE TAG OFF. THE SELLING PRICE ON THE TAG WAS $10.50. SO THEY WERE CHARGING MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH TO AMAZON CUSTOMERS. RIP-OFF- I WOULD SAY SO. <end>
 B00023JYAW  2mm Sterling Silver 20" Bead or Ball Chain Necklace ||	  sterling bead necklace  I ordered this sterling bead necklace for a pendant. It was right length,and I like it. I own many sterling silver pieces of jewelry. Most of themI know their quality by whether they tarnish or not when I wear them. Thisnecklace tarnished a little after wearing it for a few days. Still likenecklace and I know how to get rid of tarnish. But must admit I was a little disappointed that necklace tarnished. <end>  Beautiful!  I love this chain! It is heavier than I thought it would be and a great length. I wear it several times a week with pendants and with other necklaces. <end>  Not impressed, but not disappointed.  I can work w/this. Iv order several chains from Amazon last year, only to be disappointed almost everytime. At lease I can work w/ this. <end>  VERY PRETTY.  I LIKE SILVER AND WEAR IT ALL THE TIME. I LIKE THE BEADED SILVER WITH PENDANTS ON IT. IT CAN GO DRESSY OR CASUAL. <end>
 B00023JYDO  Sterling Silver Hamsa or Hand of Fatima Earrings ||	  Hamsa Earrings  This is the third time I have purchased jewelry from Silver Insanity. I am never disappointed. I wore these out last night and several people (even a guy) commented on them. <end>  Great!  The price was excellent, my daughter had picked them on her wish list, and wears them almost every day. Excellent service. <end>  Fantastic earrings!  These earrings are fantastic! They're more lightweight than the picture would lead, but I think the photo's specifically for the amazing amount of detail in such a small earring! <end>  cute and elegant  These are beautiful! A lot smaller than I expected them to be but nevertheless very well made, good quality silver. They look very elegant on and I received a lot of nice compliments on them already. <end>  beautiful earrings  Nice hamsa earrings! I bought it as a present for my girlfriend and she wears them everyday! A balanced and shining hamsa.I recomend this ones. <end>
 B00023JYWK  New Sterling Silver Mayan Dragon on Black Onyx Pendant ||	  Silver Mayan Dragon  I liked it very much, it was unique and I have received many complements on it. <end>  Mayan Dragon Pendant  This necklace is very well built, I have to admit is was smaller than I thought it was, but it is very nice and I have recieved many compliments. <end>
 B00023JZ0Q  Sterling Silver Fairy Long Aqua Aura Crystal Earrings ||	  fairy earirngs  I like these fairy earrings because they are a bigger size than most. I dont like small earrings. However for $50 I thought they were overpriced cause they are lightweight material and kind of cheap looking. I would have liked something heavier and the crystal pieces more substantial. These were more a $25 earring but the customer service was great and I kept them anyway because I love fairies! Kandy W. <end>
 B00023JZFG  Sterling Silver Open Heart Purple AMETHYST Pendant ||	  Wow this is really pretty  MY Wife loved it.Super nice stuff.. Well Made and packaged nicely.Thanks Again. WE love it. <end>
 B00023JZHE  Sterling Silver Victorian Style Genuine Rainbow Moonstone Earrings ||	  Absolutely beautiful!  These earrings are a great size and absolutely gorgeous! I highly recommend for anyone who loves moonstone or Victorian jewelry! <end>  So pretty  So pretty my family bought me two pairs, which, of course is the problem when the list does not automatically update when you buy from another store...oh well, now I have an extra pair! Can't send them back because that would cost more than half the price of the item, not worth it! But at least I like them and they go with everything! Plus, I always loose one anyway. <end>
 B00023K078  Sterling Silver Sparkling Frosty White Winter Snowflake Charm Pendant Necklace 18" ||	  Not thrilled  The item was purchased for my daughter, no sparkle and it would bend pretty easily. My husband talked me into keeping it because we were short on time for Christmas presents. My daughter liked it but if given more time, I would have returned it and gotten something better. <end>  Absolutely Fabulous for the price!  I love this thing and wear it all the time in the winter. It is the perfect size and is very pretty. Can't complain about the price much either! <end>  just as it appears, very sparkly.  arrived quickly, and looks great. bought with the earrings. <end>  sparkly snowflake  beautiful. very happy with this item. always get beautiful pieces from silver insanity. excellent. <end>  I LOVE this item!  This is a beautiful, sparkly snowflake pendant. I love it so much that I bought two others, one for my daughter and one for a friend. It is a great item at a great price and came to me very quickly. <end>  Snowflake  Very pretty and dainty. Gift for a 16 year old and she definitely liked it. <end>  Simple and beautiful  For Christmas, nothing beats a beautiful snowflake necklace (except, perhaps, the matching earings). The frosted look adds a dimension not normally found in the many snowflakes I looked at. Good choice. <end>
 B00023K0O6  Spine and Ribs Gothic Sterling Silver Gothic Fingertip Nail Ring ||	  not the same ring as pictured, but simply gorgeous still!!!! a must have and so inexpensive, most fingertip clawrings are 150usd  the only rant i can think of is i was wishing for the first ring image, however what i got was a slight bit different than both, but it really is a totally gorgeous ring, I dont regret this, infact you have me smiling for hours over this beauty ) It has been added to my awesome goth ring collection, so pls make some more, and can i specify which i want in a mail or something? as if you make more I will be back for another, woohoo what a pretty ring!!! and kinda sharp, without being sharp enough to cut skin, if you take it to the skin, awesome!!!!! fast good service quality silver item!! <end>  Not as pictured  While I am happy with my purchase, be aware that of the two rings pictured, neither one is the ring you will receive. Seems a little misleading, to me. <end>
 B00023K0OG  Sterling Silver Green Aventurine Fairy Hummingbird Slide Pendant ||	  Very neat and not gaudy  I have this same charm with a clear glass/crystal underneath. I really like it and have gotten many compliments when I wear it. Most everyone wants to know what it is, since its fairly intricate. The only downside I have to it would be that when the silver spins the crystal underneath, it collects stuff between the two and is sometimes difficult to clean out. Other than that I really like it. <end>
 B00023K1WM  Sterling Silver Green Celtic Knot Claddagh Ring size 6.5(Size 4.5,9) ||	  So Disappointed  I had this ring for years and lost it a few months ago, so I was very excited when I found it here online and at such a great price. It came very quickly and I had no problems receiving the order but the ring itself was so disappointing. It looks nothing like the product pictured! It's a very shiny silver. Nothing like the beautiful antiqued look in the picture or how my old ring used to look. Its also very cheap looking. Like it came from a quarter machine in an arcade. DON'T ORDER IT. it looks nothing like the ring in the picture. I am so bummed. I hope I get my money back. <end>  Quarter Machine Rings  I concur with the other 1 star review. The ring is cheap and looks nothing like the picture. It doesn't have an antiqued finish as shown. It looks like something you'd get out of a quarter machine at a grocery store.If you want to impress your lady, look elsewhere. <end>  very pretty  A very nice sturdy ring. i bought this ring when i lost my claddagh. its strong and looks very nice on the hand. would make a great gift for any lady <end>  Good ring  It is a very shiny silver, but I think it looks lovely, not cheap. It's definitely sterling silver - just as sturdy as another sterling silver ring of mine - and the craftsmanship is very beautiful. The 'crown' looks a little cheesy, as it's sitting atop the heart without touching it at all, but otherwise it is a very nice, simple kind of ring with a bit of a Celtic flair.  3It doesn't look like the tarnished antique you see in the picture except in design, though. Just as a warning~ <end>  Awesome ring  I got this ring shortly before the last Harry Potter book was released, in what...2007? I've worn it every single day since then, and it hasn't broken or turned my finger green or anything else like that. It actually looks better than the picture, which looks kind of like cheap costume jewelry. The little green "gem" (whatever it is) is actually pretty dark, since no light gets behind the ring. I'd highly recommend this ring to anyone. I'd consider getting other one for my other hand, even! <end>
 B00023K1X6  Sterling Silver Scottish Celtic Knot Emerald-Green CZ Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Beautiful piece and well-priced!  I am very pleased with this ring. Have had it approximately one year and have received many compliments. Its size is perfect and not once has it tarnished in the length of time I've owned and worn it. Very, very satisfied! <end>  Perfect in every way  I received this ring a week ago, three days after ordering. The stone is a bright nice shade of green, like in the picture. I ordered a size 6, and it fits the finger intended perfectly. I believe I've fallen in love! <end>
 B00023K2LC  Sterling Silver X Weave Puzzle Ring Size 5.5(Size 5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  Silver Puzzle Ring  The ring was very beautiful and exactly as described. The only problem we have is my daughter took it apart out of curriosity. She has not been able to put it back together using the instructions provided on the web. We also noted the silver is very soft and bends easily. <end>  nice  do not let ring get undone, takes a while to put back together. Accidentallydropped it at work and it everyone attempted to put it back together, it took hours..... <end>  unique puzzle ring  I purchased this ring because when I was younger I owned one. The ring is exactly what I hoped it would be. It took me sometime to put it together the first time I took it off, but I finally figured it out with tips from an online video that helped me through. Now I can put it back together when needed. I wear this ring every day. It is simple and nice looking. <end>  puzzle ring  Love the ring. Very comfortable. Shipping turnaround was great. Only downside is be careful taking it off..takes forever to figure how to put it back together, unless you are looking for something to do.  ) <end>  Puzzle Directions  I love this ring-- I wore one for almost 4 years before losing it (so I'm here to get another!).For those of you who accidentally drop it, these instructions accurately illustrate how I put mine back together [...]There's a little trick though, the 2 pieces that form the X shape across the front only fit in one configuration, so if they don't fit together perfectly, drop the piece on the rightmost side and bring it back up to be on the left hand side of the piece you're still holding. This should rearrange the pieces so that they will twist together correctly.Once you get the hang of it you can put it together in seconds. <end>  Very pretty ring  This is a very cute ring!! I read the reviews on this ring before I bought it, and saw how difficult some said it was to fit back together after taking it appart, so I haven't done that yet. Although it looks VERY tempting, I will not be taking it apart, but it is VERY pretty to wear!! <end>  Nice Puzzle Ring  Ordering was easy. The order arrived promptly and was well packaged. I bought this for my daughter (in her 20's) because she loves puzzles. She was quite pleased with the ring. I would prefer that the assembly instructions be included with the purchase of the ring. Overall, a pleasant shopping experience. <end>
 B00023K3DO  Sterling Silver Amethyst and White CZ Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Exactly as pictured!  Ring is beautiful, of excellent quality, super price and was received in only several days. My second order from this company and will definately order again. <end>  Gorgeous!  Beautiful ring. Fast delivery- I am very satisfied with this product and the delivery. I love 'Silver Insanity'! <end>  The Color was a Little Disappointing  The ring is very sparkely, however the purple color is not NEARLY as deep and rich looking as the picture. It is very light, almost a lavender, and doesn't really look Amethyst at all. I don't believe this is the seller's fault - and was VERY happy with other items I ordered from them and the speed of delivery. <end>
 B00023K3HU  Sterling Silver Multi-Stone CZ Dragonfly Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8) ||	  Dragonfly Ring  This will go with any color due to the 4 different stones. Much better quality than I expected at very little cost. I'm delighted with it. Fast delivery from a good company. <end>
 B00023K3W0  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Puzzle Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  It's a puzzler!  I do like this puzzle ring, even though I have not ventured to take it apart and reassemble it again. On my receipt, I saw an e-mail address for instructions on how to solve it, but the address didn't work. However, there are instructions at another site ([...]) for their claddagh puzzle rings that may be helpful if you can't solve it.All in all, a neat looking ring, but take it apart at your own risk!  ) <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Puzzle Band Ring Size  love this ring it is still in good condition and NOPE I never took it apart. I wanted to so bad but read on line it was very hard to get it back together. I had a lot of compliments on this one <end>  Great Ring! Challenging and Fun!  My boyfriend bought me this ring. I love it! A claddagh ring and a puzzle ring in one!! Great idea!It was tricky to put back together the first couple times, but I love a challenge (otherwise what's the point of a puzzle ring??) and now that I now how to do it I can put it back together in about a minute. Just don't force it - as many others have mentioned the individual rings are thin and bend easily. No force it necessary to get it back together, just a bit of finagling.I did find that it was a bit tarnished when I first took it apart but some baking soda and water polished it up nicely. It could have gotten five stars had it not been tarnished upon arrival. Boyfriend, however, does get five stars. <end>  bad idea.  I had this maybe two weeks before it broke. Junk. Thin week bands make for bad puzzle pieces. This thing will not stand up to daily wear for long. <end>  Love the ring!  I love my ring, although I have not tried to take it apart. I have always wanted a Claddagh ring and bought this for me for my birthday. I received it fast and it is beautiful. I have read the other reviews on how hard it is to take it apart or put it back together. I do not even want to try, I love it just the way it is! This is the second ring that I have ordered from Amazon.com and would recommend them to anyone that loves puzzle rings or Celtic jewelry! <end>  Fantastic  This is the most unique claddagh I've seen yet, a claddagh AND a puzzle ring. Great quality, quick shipping. I was very pleased. <end>  Awful  I ordered this ring for my daughter. It arrived severely tarnished. Because it was an inexpensive ring it didn't make sense to pay for shipping to send it back. We took the ring apart and used some silver polish on it. The tarnish came off but but so did silver coating also the ring is impossible to put back together. The instructions aren't for this ring in particular and aren't very clear. Not to mention how flimsy the metal is. Not a good buy. <end>  Other Opinion  I have read the other reviews about the weak metal, and the fact that people can't put the ring back together. My husband bought this ring for me and I could not even take it apart. Puzzle rings in general are thinner so they break and bend easily if your not careful. My husband bought it a lil too small, so I had it resized... the jeweler didn't want to until I said that I didn't care about the fact that it would never come apart. I love it and it is a great sign of love between us. <end>  An enjoyable piece  While not an exceptional ring, this is still an enjoyable piece for fans of either the Claddagh or puzzle rings in general.Both my wife and I wear a Claddagh for our wedding rings. The puzzle rings came this afternoon and while my wife hasn't dismantled hers just yet I simply couldn't wait. This, like most puzzle rings, is tricky and requires a certain amount of dexterity and patience. After playing with it for a couple of horus I succumbed and found a very useful video tutorial by Googling '4BDS Puzzle Ring Solution Video'While I feel like I cheated some; the solution, once you've learned it, comes pretty readily to mind.The only reason I held back on 5 stars is the metal bands have become somewhat warped in my frustrated gropings! The inside of the bands will appear damaged and tarnished - I imagine this ring may be silver plated. From other reviewers' mention of allergic reactions, don't be fooled in thinking this is a sterling silver ring. <end>  Claddagh Puzzle Ring  Nice ring for price. We have found the silver to be a little soft. Bends easily. The instructions on the Internet are not ring specific for this item, therefore we are afraid to even take it apart. Needs better instructions written for specific rings. <end>  Present for Daughter  I bought this as a present for my daughter. I was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring. (If anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together, check wikipedia. I believe there is even a video.) I highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver, symbolism, and something just a little bit different. <end>  Nice ring  Nice ring, fast delivery. I still need to check it out, because my daughter says it doesn't completely "break down" the way my old puzzle ring did. <end>  if only i could put it back together!  I got this ring for my girlfriend for her birthday. We both loved it, it is really quite beautiful. Yet we still can't put it back together. It has been apart for about two months now, it's really disappointing. If you're amazing at putting things together, than you'll like it. If you're not, you'll probably still like it, but you might wan to leave it together. <end>  Rings were beautiful...the puzzle not so...  I bought two of the claddagh puzzle rings for me and my boyfriend for christmas. I was so excited that I recieved them by Christmas. The rings looked as I expected them too and I was thrilled to have matching rings for my boyfriend and I. However I was very very dissapointed when my puzzle ring fell apart and ther was no directions to put it back together. It fell apart the first night I got it before I had the chance to give my boyfriend his, which of course again very dissapointing seeing as I bought it as christmas presents. I tried for several hours that night to get it back together and so did other family members but no luck. We even got instructions with diagrams and watched a movie of it but it still wouldn't go back together. Luckily my boyfriends hasn't fell apart yet nor has he taken it apart after hearing my horor story of it. I had to buy a new ring from them just to have our matching rings because we are getting our pictures taken together. Hopefully it will arive soon and then when it does I am wrapping something around it to get it to stay together before I can get it welded. But its pretty dissapointing I have to do this seeing as its suppose to be a puzzle ring. All in all though they are pretty beautiful rings just be careful with them and don't take them apart unless you have plenty of time trying to figure out how to put them back together or you plan on spending another 20 plus shipping for a new ring. By the way you can't send the ring back for a refund unless it is assembled so beware of that too. The company itself gets a good rating from me though. <end>  Wow  I got a lot of shipping alerts and was confused as to when it would arrive, but i got it now and I couldn't be more pleased!!! gorgeous! I can't wait to take it apart and put it back together again!! Perfect for puzzle lovers! <end>  gripkid  I really love this ring! I mainly got it because they showed it on an episode of the Buffy the vampire slayer for a big fan one of these rings are a must! I haven't ventured to take it apart...YET and to be honest by the looks of these reviews it'll be a long time before i do *give me two-three days* haha BUT i did find some instructions from the website silver sanity that sells these the the website that they put on the reciept is kinda funky and i had to google it just to get to the right page but i'll post it on here seeing as no one else has---How to assemble a four link puzzle ring, step by step.Puzzles rings are a most intriguing piece of jewelry, with an interesting lore attached to them. In some areas of Turkey, they are the most common wedding band worn. Originally, they were intended to serve as a sort of motivator to keep married people faithful to one another. The theory was, if a spouse endeavored to commit adultery, they would first have to remove their wedding band, hiding their marital status from the potential fling. Since the rings are made up of interlocking bands, forming a pattern that requires knowledge to duplicate, once they are removed from the finger they fall apart quite easily...thus incriminating the guilty party.Today, these rings are worn mostly because of their beauty, not to mention the fact that they are excellent conversation pieces. They are a popular souvenier among tourists in the Middle East, especially Turkey. Many military personnel return from a tour of duty owning one or more of these rings, however, in time, the solution is forgotten!The following is a step by step solution for a thin band, four link puzzle ring.1. You will notice that the four bands are similar, but upon closer inspection there are slight differences. Two of the links have a simple peak to them, and the other two links have a dip and a peak. Look carefully to identify each link. At this time, single out the link that has a simple peak, with 4 etches carved into it. (The etches may be faint, compare the two simple peak links and choose the one with more grooves)2. Once you have found the simple peaked link with four grooves, hold that link only, letting the other links dangle. Turn the ring so that the top of the peak is pointing away from you. There should be two links dangling from the link you are holding, with the fourth link dangling from those two links.3. While still holding the four grooved link, take the other simple peaked link, which should be the one dangling from the bottom, and bring it up to meet with the one you are holding. You should now be holding the two links together, the bands of the links together, and the points of the peaks pointing outwards, opposite of each other (It should look like a diamond)4. Continue holding the links together with your thumb and pointer finger (you will need your other fingers for the next part).5. You will notice that you now have the two 'dip and peak' links dangling from the two links you are holding. Select the link on the right---this is trial and error, sometimes the correct link will be on the right already, and sometimes you may have to pass the wrong link over the top of the ring in order to place the correct link in the proper position. The two dangling links are very hard to tell apart, so you will discover which is the correct one for the next step by following these instructions  6. After grabbing the dangling link on the right, turn the link so that the peaks and dips face you. Looking at the link, notice the dips and peaks. You want the link that has peaks that point like arrows to the LEFT, then the right. (The other link has peaks that point like arrows to the RIGHT, then left )7. When you have found the correct link for the next step, hold it taut against the two simple peak bands you have been holding between your thumb and forefinger. The band of those two links should now be resting against the LEFT pointing peak of the selected link, and you should adjust your hands so that you are holding that link on your pinky, taut.8. With your free hand, grab the last remaining link. Turn the link so that the peaks and dips face the top of the ring (you should be holding the ring upright the entire time) Bring the remaining link towards the right, and overlap it with the link you're holding on your pinky. The easiest way to do this is to imagine you are trying to put the other link on your pinky with the one that's already there. If this is done correctly, you will still be holding the two simple peak links between your thumb and forefinger, and they will form a diamond shape. You will also be holding the other two links on your pinky, they should form a figure eight, with the other two bands passing through the center.9. At this point, I usually change the position of my hands. Now ,hold the figure eight together with your thumb and middle finger, trying not to disrupt the other ones too much! Try to maintain the diamond shape in some way, hold it however you are comfortable, in a way that will enable you to continue with these instructions.10. Select the link on the top, closest to you. (part of the diamond) Spin the link around so that the peak fits through the figure eight---also, make sure that once the peak is inside the figure eight it also passes through the band of the other part of the 'diamond' . When the link has been spun, and passed through the figure eight and the band of the remaining link, fold it downwards, so that it is flush with the two links that form a figure eight.11. Well, you made it to the last remaining link...congratulations!All you have to do now is carefully spin the last link so the peak fits between the peaks and gaps of the already mostly assembled ring (just spin it, no need to do anything fancy! ) Once the last remaining link has been passed through the ring, fold it down to lay flush with the rest of the links.12. Enjoy your puzzle ring!Solving your puzzle ring may have seemed difficult and awkward this time, but with practice it's actually quite simple. If you don't feel confident that you would be able to repeat this feat, I suggest taking the ring to a reputable jeweler to be soldered together! <end>  Confusing but not too bad`  I absolutely love the look of the ring! My friend took it apart, and I worked on it non-stop for almost a day before I looked up directions on-line. Once I foudn a couple sets, I compared them and it wasn't too bad to put back together.Again, I think the ring is gorgeous. <end>  Comes with Warnings!!!  this ring, i lovedwhen i got it..even betterbut i was so curiouse as to..if i could take it apart and put it back together. not even a week and i folled around with it, bad idea. it fell apart.i still cant get it together and been messing with it any chance i could get. the instructions it comes with isnt the best either. its all words and no images. kinda confusing. so do take apart but i warn you, you better be patient and very talented to get it together <end>  Tarnish Crap!  I ordered this ring and wore it a few times and it got all tarnished! So it is not Stainless Steel, and it wasnt worth sending it back! dont waste your money!!! <end>  gorgeous  i love puzzle rings. in england it's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazon <end>  Be careful about sizing  This was given to me as a gift, and the person who gave it to me based the sizing on the sizing of the rest of the rings I wear. However, whatwe discovered is that these rings are a bit bulky (of course, that's what puzzle rings are about!), so mine is a bit too tight. I think Silver Insanity's website has instructions on sizing, but just in case that isn't an option I recommend goinga size larger. <end>  waste of money  I bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart. The bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled. Poor quality, I am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring, or the fragile nature of the metal. I wish I had my 25 bucks back. <end>  Awful ring..  Well atleast the package came quickly, cause the ring is horrible. I took it apart to see if I could put it back together, and what do I see, but the entire inside of the ring is tarnished. I used jewelery polish, and still couldn't get the ring to a silver look. Oh, and one of the bands snapped when I tried to put it back together for the first time. I contacted the seller, and am trying to get a refund. Hopefully their service is better than their products. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is my fave ring of all time. It comes with a string around it so it won't fall a part when you take it out of the box. Although, mine has to never come apart. It doesn't just fall apart like some of the looser knots do. I got a size 9 & it is a heavy ring so if you don't like heavy rings this one might not be for you.I love this ring & the company has a video you can watch & learn to how to put it, & other puzzle rings, back together. The indviual bands are thin & can bend so you have to be nice it, but it is well worth the money. <end>  It's terrible  I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring. We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless. <end>  pretty, but flimsy ring with useless assembly instructions  The ring is very pretty, but the instructions to reassemble the ring are useless and you have to be very careful with the individual rings as they are very thin metal. <end>  a puzzler!  I loved this ring the moment I saw it, and begged my boyfriend to buy it for me for christmas.When I got it, I immediatly put it on. I thought "Well, I wonder how it comes apart."BIG MISTAKE!It still hasn't been put back together, after two months, and every person in my family tried. I suggest that it come with instructions. (yes, even though this defeats the purpose) <end>  Watch out for sensitive skin  I purchased this ring for my girlfriend for Christmas after she mentioned having a claddagh ring before that broke. I think it is a really cool design and thought she'd enjoy the fact that it is a puzzle ring. And while she was really excited and likes the ring a lot she can not wear it for long periods of time due to the fact that it causes her to get blisters on her finger due to something in the metal. After later doing research on this I learned that there is a sizable number of people allergic to nickel which I suspect is present in this ring. <end>  Looks nice  I haven't disassembled it yet for fear of not being able to put it back together again. Doesn't look too hard, but judging by other reviewers' experiences, I decided not to try my luck. It looks quite nice the way it is.Once again, Silver Insanity did an excellent job. Amazon had mistakenly placed two orders, but Silver Insanity noticed it and called my attention to the fact. <end>  HELLLPPPPPP  Someone, please help me!!I have tried all the online help videos and guides and such, and I still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again! PLEASE HELP! <end>  Puzzle Ring Plus  This ring is awesome. It is well made and amazing how it fits together. My only complaint is that the idea of a puzzle ring is misleading. I thought that all four bands would come totally apart from each other. I was going to keep two rings for myself and give two rings to another person as a representation that we are two pieces, but when we are together we are whole. The problem is the rings are all inter-looped, so in order to do this I am going to have to cut them and solder them together. The other thing was, which is good for someone who doesn't want to worry about it falling apart....is that once I clipped the white band that was holding it together, it didn't fall all apart. I was expecting it to just fall to pieces. I literally had to struggle and pull at it to get it to come apart....in fact I lost patience in getting it apart and had to give it to someone else to pull apart. So as long as you aren't trying to use it like I wanted to, this ring is perfect for you. It doesn't come apart easily and they are all looped together so you can't lose any of the pieces. <end>
 B00023K4BA  Large 3D Sterling Silver Bunny Rabbit Charm Pendant ||	  I love it!  I got this charm for my daughter for christmas. She is a big bunny lover and is going to flip when she gets this bunny necklace when I give it to her.

 B00023K4FG  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Red Garnet 19" Necklace ||	  Just what I expected  I was very impressed with this item as it was just what I expected. I get lots of compliments on it when I wear it. I am very very happy with everything I have ever ordered from Silver Insanity and will continue to order from them in the future. <end>  Beautiful!!  Bought this beautiful necklace for my daughters b-day. She loves it and now other family members want me to get one for them. <end>  Very nice, but small  This is a lovely necklace but the pendant part is smaller than it looks in the picture. Very pretty overall. <end>  For the price, it's nice  I've seen very inconsistant reviews for Silver Insanity items. I received this necklace for Christmas last year, and it's pretty nice. Generally I always receive a compliment when I wear it. For the price, it's worth it. If you're looking for something nicer, you're simply going to have to pay more. <end>
 B00023K4GA  Large Sterling Silver Fairy on Solid Aqua Aura Prism Pendant ||	  Idk  I bought this for my gf christmas 09, only saw her wear it once of chistmas 10, she said she loves it but needed to find a different chain to wear it with because the one I got was too big. <end>

 B00023K7U8  Sterling Silver Wire and Chain Mens Band Ring Size 7.5(Size 7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Great ring...  I like this ring very much, it is actually the first ring I have ever purchased for myself, and fits my appearance well(Im, kind of a rocker guy). The only negative things about the ring is that it can damage some things due to the deep ridges. Also, do not wear the ring if you are using a bar of soap, because it will literally dig chunks out of the soap, and get stuck in the ring. It is easy to wash out, but reaps hell on your soap supply, haha. However, I feel that this was a great purchase, and I actually feel "naked" when I take the ring off. It almost feels like it's meant to be on my hand at this point. Which I've only worn for a little over a month. Also, if your fingers are very close together, I would not reccomend this ring, I have boney more spaced out fingers. However, if you do not have a boney more thin spaced out fingered hand. You are most likely going to have sores on your surrounding fingers from the width of the ring, unless you put the ring on your thumb. I even had a sore in the webbing of my fingers. However, I like the ring so much I left it on and the sore went away....P.S. The ring also seems to protect my hand. If I make a fist or touch something with the outside of the hand. The ring always seems to make first contact. <end>  Loving Ring  I bought this product as a second ring to wear when I was dressed casually. After I recieved the ring it has become my number one choice to wear. It is comfortable and actually has a classy look to it.I wear this ring all the time and get many compliments on it. When I ordered this ring I never thought I would love it as much as I do. This ring was a great find. <end>  Nice Ring  I love this ring. I purchased it from Amazon about a year ago and I wear it everyday. I get many compliments about the ring. I would recommend this ring to anywho who is into silver. <end>  christmas  the ring is sturdy, and heavy, worth the price, came quickly, my husband loved it. he wears it all the time., <end>
 B00023K8YI  Sterling Silver Purple CRYSTAL Maracasite Cross Pendant ||	  Pretty pendant  This is a beautiful pendant, bought for a preteen who loves purple. I put it on a choker made of lavendar organza ribbon and it made a wonderful gift. <end>
 B00023K9E2  Sterling Silver Green Agate Celtic Knot Bangle Bracelet ||	  Beautiful mate for the necklace!  Really quality bracelet, true to size and quality. Looks so nice with matching necklace..will make more purchases from Silver Insanity as I'm so pleased.  o) <end>  Poor Choice  I received this as a gift after putting it on my wish list. The first time I wore it, the clasp would not stay closed and the bracelet kept popping off despite the fact that it fit loosely on my wrist. The second time I wore it, the same thing kept happening, and luckily someone found the bracelet and asked if it was mine. I used pliers to bend the clasp so that it would stay closed. At the end of the day, I looked down and saw that the agate "stone" was GONE! Nice silver, but a poorly made bracelet. Do not recommend. <end>  green cletic agate bracelet  not as nice as it looked on the site. Way too big for anyones wrist too. It keeps rolling around and does not stay clipped <end>
 B00023K9F6  Sterling Silver Marcasite Marquise Garnet Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  In rebuttle in previous review about ring turning your finger green...  Actually, the fact that the ring turned your finger green PROVES that it is sterling silver. Most jewlery is covered with a Rhodium stain that prevents the reaction some people have with sterling silver jewelry causing a greenish hue to be left on skin afterwards. However, the stain is expensive, so if you buy fairly inexpensive silver jewelry, you can't expect it to be there. The good thing is that clear nail polish on the inside of the silver item works almost as well, and will prevent you from getting the green stains. I have the same problem with silver and it's what I do with all my stuff, works really well. <end>  beautiful  very nice looking and perfectly dainty ring loved the color of the stone and the thickness of the materials used to make it <end>  Broken Stone  The ring is beautiful.. This company is crap. Who sells a ring with the garnet stone with a chuck of it missing? Pitiful. If I had noticed it earlier, I would have petitioned for my money back. <end>  Sterling Silver Marcasite Marquise Garnet Ring  I really like the ring. It lives up to my full expectations. It made a great gift. Customer service and delivery were outstanding! <end>  does not look like the picture  I love that this ring matches my great grandmother's antique garnet bracelet but one drawback is that the metal work, while gorgeous, is two toned. I don't know how to describe it. Halfway through the detailed part of the band it has bright silver work and then it has the silver metal work with a blackened background. I wish that all of the metalwork had the blackened background because it looks more antique that way and it matches my bracelet. In the picture all of the metalwork is the same, if it looked like the picture i would be so happy. <end>  Gorgeous!!!!!  I bought this ring as a Christmas present for a friend and it is just so beautiful that I'm tempted to keep it for myself! <end>  Classic  My daughter will love this ring, she had her 1st child last Jan, and wanted a ring with her daughters birthstone, this is delicate and classy and I can't wait till Christmas to give it to her. Excellant delivery time too. <end>  I don't recommend this ring.  Although this ring is gorgeous, and very ornate (for such a small ring). There was one drawback. It turned my finger green. I only wear sterling silver or white gold jewelry, and I have many sterling silver rings, none of those rings have turned my finger green. This lead me to believe that the ring was not sterling silver as it states on the website. I would not recommend buying this ring, or any jewelry from the silver insanity company. <end>
 B00023K9GK  Sterling Silver Celtic Endless Knot 7.5" Link Bracelet ||	  latch broken  my wife put on and five minutes later the area near the latch was broken. <end>  Celtic bracelet review  I enjoy the bracelet. It is exactly as shown and has been admired by many. I would recommend this jewelry to others. <end>  keeps breaking  The link right next to the clasp keeps breaking. I received this as a Christmas present from my husband and I'm not wearing it because I'm afraid it will fall off and I'll lose it.The bracelet is beautiful and I'm really sad that I can't wear it. <end>  NICE BRACELET!  Very nice bracelet, came in a velvet pouch. But be aware that the bracelet is alot thinner/smaller than it looks in the photo. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Endless Knot Bracelet  It's amazing. Everything I wanted and more. I haven't taken it off since I got it. Very well made. I love the detail. I will buy from them again! <end>  Endless Knot Bracelet  I have been wearing my endless knot bracelet since the day it arrived. It is most comfortable and looks much more expensive than the price I paid. I teach students in a mathematics class how to create Celtic knot patterns on a grid. My bracelet is an inspiration that life offers endless possibilities toward which we should not be afraid to explore. I love my purchase and would definitely recommend giving this item as a gift to a loved one or for yourself! <end>
 B00023K9SS  Celtic Knot Claddagh Perfume Vial - Poison Jar - Urn Pendulum Pendant w/ 18" Necklace - Sterling Silver ||	  I Love It.  I bought this pendant after my soulmate passed away. I wear him around my neck now & take him everywhere. I couldn't ask for a better pendant. Much better than the typical crosses & hearts that most funeral parlors sell. <end>  better than expected  The locket is actually more beautiful in person. It has a nice heft to it without being too heavy. The hinge and clasp of the locket are well made. I feel confident storing a small special item within it. Over all it is a really nice piece of jewelry. It's unique and celebrates Celtic heritage in a not so vanilla fashion.I was really impressed at how quickly I received the locket, especially considering that it was shipped via USPS. I ordered it Tuesday evening and received it Thursday afternoon. <end>  Fantastic  My father passed about a year ago and i was planning on putting his ashes into some kind of pendant, after reserching a little I found this item.Once i recieved it I was blown away with how detailed and nice this piece is for the price.I couldnt have asked for anything better. <end>  Beautiful celtic pendant!!!  The pendant is beautifully crafted. The celtic design is of quality. The pendant's weight is a good solid one. The chain it comes with is of a bright silver so i recommend purchasing a different one, thicker (not over 2.5 mm thick) and of antique silver tone. I haven't seen anything that remotely resembles this pendant. It is one of a kind. I loved it and my spouse loved it as well (we wear it as matching pendants on a bali byzantine silver necklace purchased on eBay through happy-trader for a great price).Pendant is definitely worth buying.5 star rating for product!!!!! <end>  Exactly what I was looking for!  This is a well made, beutiful and unique pentagram cross that represents my Christian Wiccan beliefs. These kinds of crosses are very hard to find, but this one will be tough to beat as far as quality style! Anything bought from this compnay is well made and the service is fast! Love it! <end>  I bought two  I bought two  one for my sister at Christmas and the other for me, so that we would have matching pendants. We will use them as lockets to hold photos of our loved ones. I did buy a longer sterling chain for each, because the chain that came with the pendant was just too short. The clasp is nice and sturdy and I have no worries it will open unexpectedly. We are both quite pleased. <end>  smashing  I wanted to celebrate two years without smoking, on Valentine Day, So I was looking for something with hearts on it, I always admired the prayer boxes so thought maybe I could combine the two, and walla!! There this was. It has become something I wear daily and I have had so many people comment on it and some ask for the place I purchased it. And I have even put prayers in it for people who need one!!!! Thank you. <end>  Beautiful Pendant  I received this Pendant as a Birthday present. It is very beautiful in person, and the photo online hardly does it justice. <end>  A Beautiful Piece  I had this item on my Christmas List, but did not get it. I could not stop thinking about this beautiful piece of jewelry. I put my mom's ashes in it, and I also use it for pendulum dowsing. It is a good, solid pendulum and I love the design on it, as well as the box chain. This is quality jewelry that arrived in a timely manner - what more can I say? <end>  Claddagh necklace  Love this necklace, got it for my 23rd birthday from my bf. It's just the right size not huge but not tiny either. <end>  Celtic Knot Pendant  I'm so glad I purchased this pendant. It is not too heavy and not too light. I adore it. <end>  Beautiful Necklace and Pendulum  This is a really pretty sterling silver pendulum necklace with a lid so you can tuck in a small piece of paper with a wish or a prayer or even a small gemstone or memento of a loved one. <end>  as real as it gets  I bought this item for my self,and i made a very good choice the pendant is just the right size i suggest one should buy a different chain to compliment a pendant that truly worth the price. <end>

 B00023KADC  GOLDEN Chicken EGG Sterling Silver Charm Pendant OPENS ||	  Very friendly service  Ordered this as a gift and it's a pretty cute and very different item. What I'm really going to boast about, however, is the customer service. The original wouldn't open, so I emailed the company asking for any advice on how to fix it. Without any more questions or run-around, they asked me to ship it back and they'd send a replacement. Which they did in a very timely manner. I really appreciate how simple the transaction was and the speed at which they got me the replacement.I only rate the PRODUCT at 4 stars because of the fact that it needed replaced. I feel that these should be better tested when coming off the assembly line. <end>

 B00024VSG4  Wavy Cubic Zirconia Bridal Bangle Bracelet ||	  key ring  I was hopeful when I saw this product "on line". I ordered it, and the little ball that is used to screw on and close the horseshoe key ring, came off. I returned it, and the same thing happened. Don't waste your money. <end>  Does the job  I purchased this item for my husbands birthday. I looked all over for a decent quality horse shoe key ring. This one is great! Good size to carry in a pocket and quality metal. The only issue is the threaded ball does not stay tight. But this has happened to all the horse shoe key rings he has owned. He added a little Lock-tite and it works great. <end>  A terrific value!  You can find other key rings similar to this one, but they are considerably more expensive and are not any better in quality. This is a great deal for the price. <end>  flimsy crap  Blame me for thinking this looked like something Thomas Crowne would have his keys on, I should have known you get what you pay for. Not solid at all it bean to tarnish after one week of use and the metal is very soft, it bends under the slightest of pressure and will never really retain the pictured design. After two weeks it was tossed in the trash, lesson learned. <end>  Simple, yet aesthetically pleasing.  I first saw this when it was paired with a LaCiE flash memory device shaped like a key. While relatively uninterested in that product, this one struck me as a pleasant alternative to jamming my fingernails into key rings. It doesn't seem flimsy, though I do have slight concerns about the ball that screws in on the end.Nothing special, just the same sorts of concerns that a person with a tongue piercing would have about the opposite end of their bar being swallowed, dropped down a drain, etc. It serves its purpose and cheers me with its visually pleasing form.EDIT  The stupid ball came off. I'm unhappy.EDIT in my EDIT  They replaced the ball. I'm happy again. <end>  It's okay,,,  It is very nice, but the little ball screws off too easily. It kept coming off, kept coming off, until finally, we couldn't find it. It isn't the product - but the style that I have a problem with. <end>  Love it!  This is an elegant, strong, simple keyring. Its beautifully made and arrived quickly. I am very happy with this purchase. <end>  Great key ring.  I've used a keyk ring like this for 40 years and have lost and replaced two. This replacement was equal to the ones I've used before and is a very attractive, nice key ring. If I lose it (let's hope not) I would replace it again. <end>
 B00024W0VG  Sterling Silver Italian 3mm Tube Hexagon-shaped Italian Hoop Earrings ||	  Lovely Earrings  Purchased these as a gift for a friend and because I liked them so much, she in turn, bought a pair for me!! Substantial but very light - they don't tug on the lobe at all. The Hexagonal shape and tubing differentiates these from the typical hoop earring. Highly recommend. <end>
 B00025O4QY  Amazon.com  Gypsy Glass Bead Bracelet (safari)  Clothing ||	  Great  The product came quickly and was as shown. My sister loved it. How ever the shipping was way to high. It should have been shipped over night for what I paid. <end>  Talk about fast!  This glass bead bracelet I ordered is just beautiful! I am so pleased with the quality of the materials used. The fast delivery was amazing! I told my husband this evening, next year I'm ordering lots of these for Christmas gifts! Thanks Carolyn for a beautiful bracelet! <end>  Great buy and matches tons of outfits!  My mom requested some fun/chunky bead bracelets for Christmas, and these ended up being the perfect thing! I ordered them in red, blue and green, and couldn't be happier. They're the perfect size for both our wrists, and have sturdy clear elastic that isn't visible through the translucent beads. They stretch easily, but only when you want them to - no problems with them falling off your wrist or anything like that. It should be noted that the beads are slightly darker than they look in the images, though.The shipper upgraded the purchase from ground to express shipping at no additional cost, which was I great surprise! I got them within two or three days (about three days earlier than expected), and had plenty of time to wrap them before the holidays despite having ordered them a bit on the late side (around Dec. 20th). A great buy, and I'll definitely order some more in the future for myself! <end>
 B0002601XS  Thread Earrings    THSS    Medium Length, Sterling Silver ||	  Very pretty!  These are very pretty, and can be worn at different relative length angles, which does vary the appearance a little. If you haven't worn threads before, it can be a little uncomfortable getting them in and taking them out, but if you take your time, it's no problem.  ) <end>  Beautiful thread earrings  This item arrived in excellent condition and on time. It easily slid into my ear and stayed in place where I placed each end to dangle. It made it easy to wear on both ears. I love it and I will continue to do business with this company in the future. <end>  finally  I have been looking for thread earrings without charms for a long time. Finally, Just what I was looking for. I got a pair for my daughter as well. THANK YOU <end>  broke  the part of the earring that goes thru the ear broke off after only 2 days. i loved the earring before that. <end>  Lots of compliments  I got these for Christmas. They are delicate and unique. I've had any compliments on them. Easy to put in and wear. Recommended. <end>  Threaders  I'm so glad i found the earrings... Had a little trouble with the arrival time. But now that there are here I love the lenght,color and the ease of putting them on no backs to hurt they are perfect Thanks <end>  Very pretty and fun pair of earrings  These Sterling Silver Earrings are a very neat and stylish pair of earrings. You can wear them to dress up or dress down anything you wear. I have only recently started wearing Sterling. I usually wear gold, but I am loving the versatility that I can have with my Sterling. Great item, well made, light weight and comes at a great price. <end>  well. its beautiful.. but not worth price  This is pretty beautiful earring.. Everyone loved it when I wore.. but it is not as thick as you feel in the picture and very delicate.. It can easily slide out of the hole.. So wear your hear up when you put this on.. I nearly lost it... <end>  Really nice thread earrings  The quality is excellent on these dangly thread earrings and they look superb. They don't really move so you can position the height of the front and back as you like. Do keep in mind that they're two inches or so in total length so the dangle is less than an inch either side, so if you're looking at a longer overall dangle then these aren't for you. Good product - good price. <end>  Awesome Earrings  Love these earrrings... I wear them all the time... they're so light, they don't bother your ears... I love them... I've purchased others, but nothing as good as these!! <end>

 B00027CURC  Tommaso Design(tm) Genuine 3 Stone and Diamond Mothers Ring LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  Very nice ring for the price  I am completely satisfied with this ring. It has bigger stones and a nicer style than comparably priced rings. If you are looking for a 3-stone mother's ring, this is by far the nicest I found. It came beautifully presented in a wooden ring box and velvet bag!I am impressed and very pleased. <end>  Don't be afraid to order online.  I was, like most people perhaps, a little apprehensive about ordering jewelry online. I read the reviews from other's who purchased this ring and felt a little more confident.I am happy to say that I am very pleased with the total experience from this vendor. The ring isn't "cheap" looking at all. It has some substance to it and the stones they used are very nice indeed. It comes in it's own wooden gift box, inside a plain white box, inside a nice blue velvet bag, nice. It's a beautiful piece of jewelry at a very reasonable price.The staff at finejewelers were easy to work with. Communication was great and the turn around time was excellent! I read that they will call you but I emailed them first. They returned my email very promptly to confirm my stone choices and emailed me when my order shipped. Excellent. Thank you FineJewelers! <end>  MOTHERS RING  THE RING IS EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED, THE FIT IS PERFECT, THE STONES ARE GORGEOUS, AND THE SETS ARE TIGHT.THANK YOU FOR READING THIS REVIEW. <end>  Perfect, just what I have been looking for!  The ring is just beautiful, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Thanks so much! Love it!!!!! <end>  overall a positive experience  I too was skeptical about purchasing jewelry online. However, I also struggled to find a substantial mothers ring anywhere at a reasonable price so I gave it a shot. The ordering process was easy and the ring came very quickly. In general, I am happy with the experience. The stones are a nice size. One of the stones is set crooked so I will have to have it re-set since I don't have time to send it back to the company before I give it to my mom for her birthday. Overall, I don't think you can do better at this price point for the size of the stones, the fact that they are genuine, and that it has real diamonds. <end>  Excellent Mother's Ring  I absolutely loved this ring and received it VERY quickly. Most jewelry stores take weeks to deliver a ring like this. Not to mention the prices are ridiculous and most are only 10kt gold with synthetic stones. I would recommend this ring to anyone! My mother absolutely loved it and how unique it is from most Mother's rings. I'm a very satisfied customer! <end>  Very happy  Absolutely satisfied. Also, if you're wondering how you pick the stones after you place the order they email you asking for your stone choices. That confused me at time of order. <end>  Mother's Ring  A beautiful piece of jewelry. Quality product and responsive customer service. My wife really appreciates it as a gift.

My setting is in white gold, which has retained its color and has stayed shiny since I received it about 8 months ago. Highly recommended. <end>

 B00027IRQK  14K Yellow Gold Heart Genuine Emerald Ring ||	  Beautiful  Received the ring promptly. It is beautiful. The band is rounded which feels very comfortable.

I love my ring. <end>

I can only hope that she loves it as much as I do. <end>

 B00027LTJC  14K White Gold Oval Genuine Opal Filligree Ring ||	  --- 5 Year review --- Still a great ring after stone replacement  It is a very nice looking opal ring that is not too small or too gaudy. I like the fillagree style and colorful stone. The diamonds are too small to really make a fuss over, but does give a nice sparkle touch.I ended up getting a full size too large, which may have helped me because the band is really thin, and making it smaller I beleive thickened it.Overall I am very pleased, the jeweler complimented on it and I dont think he would have guessed it was at this price.--- 5 year review ----The ring is still worn from my then girlfriend to my now wife, whis was only a birthday ring at the time and she still wears it. The gold has held up very well, no need to re-plate it yet but the opal unfortunately popped out at the "two-can" house at Litchfield beach couple years ago and we replaced it with a sapphire. the fittings were still tight so I assume the opal fractured and fell out. I learned that opals are a soft stone and can fall out or break more easily than other harder stones.5 stars, opals can break.. ring still great. <end>  Colorful opal  This ring gets mixed review from me. The opal does have nice color and seems to be of decent quality. The filligree is nice and adds to the visual appeal. As noted by other reviewers, the diamonds are small but nicely frame the opal. Unlike another review, the band on the ring I got wasn't thin and seems to be nice. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the opal/set. The ad made it look bigger. It is still a pretty ring but expected a bit larger stone. <end>

 B00027QA82  14K Yellow Gold Oval Genuine Amethyst Ring ||	  A great gift  This package arrived quickly, and there was no damage. Another review had mentioned that the ring was much smaller than it appeared to be on the site, and I definitely agree. I would recommend this as a gift for anyone who has smaller hands and doesn't like bulky rings. The quality is wonderful, the stones are cut beautifully and are very clear. Again, highly recommended. <end>

 B00027VXFW  14K White Gold Emerald-cut Genuine Opal Men's Men's Ring ||	  Enjoyed the ring at first, However.......  I've selected this ring for the beauty shown on display on Amazon. The Opal stone does NOT look like the picture. It's more opaque looking than anything. After a few months of wearing the ring the corners of the stone chipped away and are now loose inside the ring ready to fall out. I would not recommend this ring. <end>

 B00027WHY8  14K Yellow Gold Round Genuine Amethyst Men's Men's Ring ||	  Should be better  This ring is a nice piece only due to the fact that the Amethyst is a red-flash, "Siberian" stone, and is natural. The diamonds have a pretty good cut and are OK for what they are. The amethyst suffers due to a very poor cut. The table is much too large and none of the meet-points of the facets are even near correct. The critical angle required for maximum fire and color was lost because of these factors.The setting (finding) has a nice appearance but is hollow cast. This was not evident in photograph published.Overall, one can say "good" but, for the price the quality should have been much better. <end>
 B00027WI0Q  14K White Gold Round Genuine Aquamarine Men's Men's Ring ||	  It's Ok, but don't expect any weight  This is a nice ring, but do not expect it to feel like it is on your finger. There is no weight to it. The stone has a nice cut and color. If you want a nice heavey ring go with sterling. <end>

 B00028A0V4  Painted Purse Jewelry Box ||	  Don't waste your time  This item arrived in a box that looked like it'd already been opened and shoved back in for re-sale. The paints that came with it were all rock hard and did not soften when water was added. It comes with a tiny squeeze tube with glue in it that isn't enough to put on all the beads. The glue was watered down or something because it was very soupy and didn't work for holding on the beads. <end>
 B00028CVXY  Karina B(tm) Genuine Sapphire Band LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  Beautiful ring  I received this as a gift from my husband (after much hint-dropping) and could not be more pleased. The quality of the stones is excellent  the deep blue of the sapphires is perfectly offset by the bright diamonds. According to my husband, the ordering process was very easy and the ring was easily returnable (that is, if the price tag was not removed). My setting is in white gold, which has retained its color and has stayed shiny since I received it about 8 months ago. Highly recommended. <end>
 B00028MC8I  Pearl Diamond Earrings ||	  Very pretty  These earrings are very pretty. Be aware that they are very small - it doesn't take away from their charm, though. <end>  Fabulous little things!  I absolutely love these! They are utterly cute and adorable. Each ear ring looks like a bundle of grapes. I am very satisfied with my purchase. <end>
 B00028MCA6  Pearl Diamond Earrings ||	  So sweet, gorgeous and innocent looking  I ordered these earrings as a birthday present for my 18-year old cousin. I was looking for something really small and "innocent" looking. And I've found just that. The picture shown here doesn't do the necklace justice. These earrings were absolutely beautiful and so appropriate for an innocent girl. The pearls are very lustrous, but the diamond is not the whole "dot" that you see in the picture here. It is surrounded by white gold(?) metal accents to look bigger, but is still very attractive. Combined with the matching necklace, these are a perfect addition for anyone, especially those who are looking for small, not "yelling-at-you" jewelry. <end>
 B0002936DM  Amazon.com  Dead Beetle Bracelet - Small Clear  Clothing ||	  A smash hit  My girlfriend is a teacher - students are consistently amazed by this bracelet. Decidedly a conversation piece, well worth the purchase. <end>
 B00029F3D8  Diamond Gypsy-Setting Hoop Earrings ||	  These MAY be the last earrings you ever buy  SecureHoop earrings are the most comfortable earrings I have ever worn, and I do not worry about losing them. I sleep in mine, shower and shampoo, do Pilates and yoga, and have even snorkeled, and they do not come out until I take them out.The only problem I have had with them is that the only kind of earring I want to wear are SecureHoop earrings. I have three pairs. I wish they did a bit more with colored stones, in fact, because I'd probably buy additional pairs.These may be the last earrings you ever buy because you may (like me) not want to wear any others. <end>  very fine earrings  These are beautiful and beautifully made earrings. I found everything about them to be very fine. The metal has a beautiful finish, and the secure fastening is solid. The diamonds sparkle brightly and appear very colorless - however, they seem hardly bigger than pinpricks. You need to be fairly close-up to notice them. Overall, these earrings seem to be flawlessly constructed. Just be aware that they are petite. <end>  Looks cheap in person, better in photo  I am looking for a small hoop earring with a locking closure -exactly like this product.Since I participate in different sports, some involving helmets, I have been desperatelysearching for a style that was comfortable (no posts sticking out the back)and secure (one that I couldn't lose) during sports; yet simple and elegant.I also wanted one I could leave in during a shower or sleep that wouldn'ttarnish (hence white or yellow gold) or fall out.I like a matte finish and don't really care for cheap diamonds. The styleI chose had diamonds that were so small, I thought they compromisedthe look to the point that it would have been much better without (I didn't see anyon their site without diamonds).The style  (because I'm a designer)- they had no style (I have ideas of hat I'd like to see).The hoop was too thin. In short, the only things I liked, were that they were goldand had a terrific closure.I think there is a potentially large market for "Sports Jewelry". Someone out there-are you listening?Communication & response from the company "Coolstyles" was terrific, even though I didn't like their product.They are very service oriented. If I liked their products better, I would not hestitate to deal with them again! <end>  Great Product, Great Price, Great Service  I totally disagree with the reviewer of May 12, 2007. These simply were not the earrings she had hoped for. For me, they were exactly what I wanted. I am a short person with short hair and like to wear small, feminine earrings. I am also very active (bicycle, cross-country ski, swim) and need something that will stay put. The Secure Hoop Diamond Gypsy-Setting Hoop Earrings are meeting all my needs. What impresses the heck out of me is that CoolStyles (in Florida) got these earrings to me (in Michigan) on the 4th business day after I placed my order. I believe they had the best price on the 'net as well. <end>  Good quality, good service!  The vendor, through Amazon, is 'CoolStyle'. This was for a man's earring, and it was exactly what I was looking for. I searched the web for a several days looking at different vendors & styles. This one caught my eye immediately. The price seemed reasonable, compared to similar items. CoolStyle shipped it promptly, and the quality seems to be very good. The diamonds are very small - and that was exactly what I wanted - just a little bit of flash. A very nice touch is the brushed finish on the outside of the ring, while the sides are polished.BTW - I was a little nervous of the Safety Lock, but it seems to keep the earring very secure, and it is barely visible on the backside. I leave the earring on all the time, and it has never opened up on me.They also arrived with a nice polished wooden box (to keep my spare, as they come in a pair). <end>  Very nice earring.  I wanted a perfect hoop earring without a post sticking out the back. This hoop is very comfortable and perfect size. I do not wear earings normally but was able to wear this without taking it off for days. The 3 little diamonds give a very subtle shine which is also very attractive. <end>
 B00029U1GM  14k Gold Oval Hoop Earrings | Earlobe Covered Clasp Design | Bold 5mm thick Profile | Hypoallergenic ||	  Timeless  They are classical hoops. I have worn them almost every day for two years. Am I a creature of habit or what? Definitely not a fashion diva. They have held up beautifully to showers, chlorine, ocean water, hairspray, and still shine. The clasps still hold snuggly. Couldn't ask for anything better. <end>
 B0002AAFVM  Peacock Freshwater Pearl with Amethyst, Peridot and Garnet Oxidized Sterling Sprial Bracelet ||	  More beautful than in the photo!  The bracelet looked really nice in the picture and was even more beautiful when it arrived at my door. Delivery was fast and it came packaged in a lovely velour bag -- perfect for my best friend's 50th birthday. I plan to visit the artist's studio in Rhode Island at the end of the summer. <end>
 B0002AAG34  Peacock Freshwater Pearls with Amethyst, Garnet and Peridot Oxidized Sterling Spiral Necklace ||	  spring - like coil  The spiral in this necklace is a springlike coil - not visible in the picture. It's definitely a unique and beautifully done piece of jewelry so I have no desire to return it - just a little caught off guard by what it looked like in reality. Super fast shipping and truly is gorgeous. <end>
 B0002AAG5M  Copper Freshwater Pearl and Sterling Drop Earrings ||	  Great gift  The earrings are nice quality and the color of the pearl is nice and copper-y. Actual product matched description of item. <end>  not too coppery  I love copper and thought these earrings would be special, but they aren't coppery at all. The "pearl" is a light orangeish-yellow and not at all what I wanted. <end>  Nice earrings  My wife thought they were great. I thought they were a bit overpriced. <end>
 B0002BLKP6  14K Yellow Gold 1/2 ct. Diamond Earring Jackets (Higher Quality) ||	  exquisite jewelry  The earring jackets were just as I expected, brilliant stones and styling as in the picture. My studs look beautiful encased in these jackets. The seller is great and my jewelry arrived two days after I ordered them. Great product and reputable seller. <end>  A must have in every jewelry box  I debated buying these for quite a while, I now regret not buying them sooner. I was totally amazed by the actual quality when they arrived. They're beautiful,sparkly,no visible inclusions or spots. They make every pair of studs another pair of earrings. They came in a beautiful gift box, perfect for giving to anyone for any occasion. I would highly recommend these earrings. <end>  Happy to own them !!  These jackets are beautifully crafted..Perfect floral type design..they are much bigger for that carat. The purchase was worth,i was hesitant to buy them online..Product was not shipped on time,Had to call seller a couple of times but then they made it by sending it by overnight shipping. <end>
 B0002BQONE  14kt White Gold 3 Round Diamond Necklace- DS1033P ||	  Not a bad necklace for the price  My wife asked for this necklace, and the price was reasonable.

 B0002BQQ5U  14kt Yellow Gold Hoop Earrings- E3049 ||	  Hoop Earrings  The earrings that I recieved were larger than indicated on picture, therefore I had to return them. But the good thing is that I recieved full refund immediately without no hassle. <end>

It wasn't easy to find tanzanites set east-to-west so I am happy with my selection. <end>
 B0002C76HG  Tommaso Design(tm) Oval 5x3mm Genuine 3 Stone Citrine and Diamond Ring ||	  Very Happy Custonmer  I bought two of these rings.

 B0002C76US  Tommaso Design(tm) Genuine Aquamarine and Diamond 3 Stone Ring LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  Perfect!  My husband gave me this ring first as a promise ring while we were dating, and I loved it so much that it has continued on as my engagement ring and now wedding ring. It is absolutely beautiful and a fantastic deal for the price! We had looked long and hard for a ring with my birthstone and it is just too perfect for me to part with it. The stones are larger than I expected and as long as you clean the stones occasionally (I rarely do) the blue is absolutely stunning. If we had to, we would make the purchase all over again and I would recommend it to anyone. <end>

I have not had it appraised and checked by my local jeweler yet, so cannot speak to the quality of the stone. To my ametuer eye, it is satisfying.However, the craftsman work on the band was the crudest I've ever seen. Not sure if it is due to the re-sizing, but I've had rings re-sized before and none came back asymmetrical. <end>  Good stone, but bad band  Received the ring in a timely manner.The stone is lighter and more purple than the blue shown in the picture, but very pretty nontheless.

 B0002CVMZS  Sterling Silver Butterfly Earrings ||	  Sparkly!  Very pretty earrings! Arrived in a cute box and in great condition. Gave them to my aunt who loves butterflies and she really loved them. They are the perfect size, too. Not super tiny, but not ridiculously huge/gawdy. <end>
 B0002CVN6Q  Sterling Silver Oval Garnet Earring and Necklace Set ||	  Very Pretty  The earrings and necklace were surprisingly pretty. I think the color of the garnet was a little darker than expected and I was a little taken aback that it was sent in a small zip top plastic baggie, but they're very nice and were nice to give as a gift. <end>  Perfect  It was even more beautiful in person. It was a Christmas gift so I was a little worried but when it was opened, I was pleased. <end>  Beautiful  I was not expect this to be so nice. The necklace is what impressed me the most, it is a very beautiful necklace and not too thin. The set itself is nice. One thing i was unimpressed about was the packaging, I was disappointed by this. However overall I am happy. <end>  Garnet earring/necklace set  GORGEOUS. Love garnets-lost many in our house fire. It is not my birthstone but LOVE the color red. Also, allergic to gold, so I always look for silver. Heavy and well made. Thank you. <end>  Earring & necklace set  The sterling silver oval necklace and earring set was smaller than I thought it would be. It is very nice and dainty, and I like it !! <end>
 B0002CVNKM  14KT Ladies .56CT Blue Topaz Pendant ||	  Very Sad Packaging  This necklace is beautiful even better then the picture BUT...the delicate chain came tangled and knotted. After a hour of working onit it's still tangled. Naturally it's a gift so I want it as perfect as it can be. I'm at the point where I may need to cut the chain and get a different one.Guess I'll try to untangle it some more. Can anyone loan me a magnifing glass? Just glad I opened and checked it before gift wrapping!!! <end>
 B0002CVOEC  14KT Oval Garnet Leverback Earrings ||	  Nice earrings at a nice price  I bought these earrings for my wife for Christmas and received them shortly after placing the order.The carrier managed to smash them during shipping because of the packaging.I notified the merchant immediately and they were more than happy to get me another set out in time for Christmas. They told me to just mail the others back when I got a chance.The new ones arrived in time and my wife is very happy with them with no complaints. <end>
 B0002CWUMM  Letter "L" Initial Pendant ||	  Smaller than expected  I purchased the pendant to replace one that I lost a few weeks ago, but was very disappointed after receiving it and finding out that it was only about one-half inch in size. The pendant that I sought to replace was at least one inch and fit perfectly on my gold chain. Aside from the size, it is a very nice piece of jewelry. <end>
 B0002CWVIK  14KT Shiney Cross ||	  Shiney Cross Necklace is a huge disappointment  I ordered this for my daughters 16th birthday. It is described as 1 inch which would have been the perfect size. However, it is not 1 inch but almost 3/4 of an inch. It is less than 1/2 inch wide even though it is described as 1 inch wide. It looks like something for a small child. I have learned my lesson and will never order from this company again. My daughter has a lot of health concerns and this was supposed to be a special gift for her. This is my most disappointing order of this holiday season. Glad I did not order the chain from this company!!! <end>
 B0002CWVTE  14KT Filigree Drop Earrings ||	  Gorgeous and delicate  They're smaller than I originally thought from the picture, but when I received these for Christmas from my boyfriend, I couldn't've been happier! They're absolutely gorgeous earrings. I get compliments on them all the time. I wear them quite frequently and love the diamond-cut filigree. They're just absolutely beautiful. <end>
 B0002CWWHK  1/4ct Total Weight Round Brilliant Diamond Earrings Set 14kt Gold Leverbacks ||	  Disappointing  I recently purchased these earrings, it looked great as pictured, but was disappointed on the setting of the stone, it stands to far out from the ear when worn. <end>
 B0002D8FZM  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Initial Letter N Alphabet Pendant, 1/2 inch long ||	  Pretty little thing  This necklace is very pretty and seems to be holding up well for costume jewelry.The only issue  it was received without the chain which was supposed to be included. The seller did promptly send a chain but unfortunately, it was received after the holidays. <end>
 B0002D8G5G  Color Stone Cross ||	  Religious Jewelry Fan  This necklace is very cute and will probably get better with wear, meaning that it is a little bit too shiny for my conservative tastes. But at this price, it was a great value for the money. The cross itself is just the right size; very dainty and pretty colors in the stones. The chain is a little too shiny but will get better with wear. A lovely pendant for a teenage girl. <end>
 B0002D8G92  Sterling Silver Love Knot Floating Heart Flawless Quality, 5/8 x 5/8 inch wide ||	  Size is deceiving  The heart as well as the chain would be a great gift for either a child or a teen, however, not for an adult. I returned the Floating Heart for a refund! <end>  Silver love pendant/necklace  This was a beautiful gift for my wife on Valentine's Day. She loved it, very much. <end>  unique design is its best selling point  I bought this as a valentine's gift for my wife. She loved the unique design.I didn't know that it comes with its own chain, so I bought a different (much nicer) chain for it.It took a while for it to arrive, although it is within their estimated delivery time. <end>  Chain fell apart  The chain broke in my hands. The pendant is very pretty but...the chain fell apart before any use. Since it's sold with the chain, I believe it's reasonable to expect the chain to be functional. Amazon won't replace, the originator of the product (sabrinasilver.com) won't provide support or a replacement chain. So... there's my review. <end>  Cute pendant, good price  This pendant is exactly as described (for those who have said it's small, it is 5/8" x 5/8", which really is a perfect size for this pendant) and daintily beautiful. There seemed to be a bit of scuffing on the front arch of the heart, but I think that is due to the craftmanship and not a scuff from handling. The chain is okay--nothing special--but it's a very pretty gift for a fair price. <end>  Nice piece of jewelry  I'll make this short and sweet. It's a lovely necklace. The heart knot is pretty, as is the chain it comes with. I also feel that the chain is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about breaking it, and I like the length. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you can't wear it with the heart in the proper position. It just twists and hangs from the bottom. It can only hang from one of the curved spots, as you can see in the picture. I've had quite a few people tell me my heart had twisted while they tried to fix it! Otherwise, it's a pretty piece and i enjoy wearing it. <end>  beautiful, inexpensive, how can you loose!?!?!  I bought this for my girlfriend as a christmas present. Its one of those pieces of jewlery that's tasteful and great with any type of outfit. <end>  VERY BEAUTIFUL, VERY LATE  i finally recieved the love knot floating heart i ordered for my wife. 3 days late, very upsetting. but well worth the wait.very beautiful. i ordered a herringbone chain also from sabrina. thank god i did because the chain with it is very small, would be for a child. but the charm looks awesome on the herringbone. very pleased with the look. looks very classy and expensive <end>  FLOATING HEART  IT IS A VERY NICE PENDANT AND THE FINISH IS GREAT. IT LOOKS LIKE AN EXPENSIVE ONE AND I WILL USE IT WITH MY 18K WHITE GOLD OMEGA. <end>
 B0002D8GKQ  Sterling Silver Large Crucifix Pendant Highly Polished Handmade, 2 inch ||	  Nice, my son loved it  Looks very good, nice size and the transaction was smooth <end>
 B0002D9D6M  14KT Two Tone Pearl and Diamond Ring ||	  Beautiful ring, great price  This ring is gorgeous, exactly what I wanted, and fits perfectly. Delivery was very fast. The seller even contacted me by email before shipping to make sure the size was correct. Price was very reasonable. I am very happy! <end>
 B0002D9DHQ  Ladies Ruby and Diamond Ring ||	  A wonderful ring  At first when i got the ring, it seemed a little small, but when i gave it to my girlfriend, she absolutely loved it. She told me, that she doesn't like big rings, and that one was perfect. She wears everyday now because she says it's her lucky ring. Im glad i picked it... <end>
 B0002D9Q6E  2.4MM 14kt Gold Flat Diamond Curb Necklace ||	  Great value for what you get  I had a hard time finding an affordable curb chain that wasn't too chunky with the right design. Most of the smaller chains seemed overpriced for their size, or look bad. I looked around for a long time at jewelers and other websites, and this is the best deal I found. The seller delivered the item overnight (which was impressive to me), and I received the item about three days after placing the order. The item is exactly as advertised and even better in person than I imagined. I would definitely buy again from this seller. <end>
 B0002D9Z7Y  .50Ct Round Diamond Gents Wedding Band ||	  Outstanding!!  Tremendous value for such a stunning, gorgeous ring. It's like having an uncle in the jewelry business! The customer service was excellent. A.J. responded to my questions in a fast, courteous and knowledgable manner. He was great with answering all of my queries and getting this ring out to me within 3 days--even with sizing!!! My fiance loved it and immediately put it on but I will be putting it back in the box until our wedding day  ) I will do all of my jewelry shopping with them before I look anywhere else. <end>
 B0002DA1WC  .01CT Round Diamond and Oval Ruby Ring ||	  Dainty, delicate, beautiful  Just received my ring. It's just as expected. I wanted something petite to use also as a stacker. A very good buy for the price. It would be a good gift for a teenager too. I love it. <end>
 B0002DA1WM  .01CT Round Diamond and Oval Ruby Ring ||	  Dainty, delicate, beautiful  Just received my ring. It's just as expected. I wanted something petite to use also as a stacker. A very good buy for the price. It would be a good gift for a teenager too. I love it. <end>
 B0002E3I4Y  Mens Titanium Celtic Beast Artistic Tribal Dragon Band Ring(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  Great price for Titanium  I've been looking for a Titanium ring like this for months and the cheapest price I found was over $100. Once I saw the price on it i figured what could I lose. But, this was the same product asa the others I'd seen and for a lot less. The process was quick and easy as well was the delivery. This is the reason I shop online......... oh and by the way the design should read "Tribal Phoenix" <end>  Gift  I bought this ring last year as a gift for my best friend. The company has astoundingly quick delivery so kudos to them for it. Unfortunately they didn't have his size then (10) so I had to buy size 11. It was big for the finger I intended him to wear it on, but he switches it around or puts it on his chain.The design unfortunately scratches easily, so he takes it off when he's doing rough work such as moving chairs and tables. This is a ring that is probably great for light-active days/events. <end>  Great price and looks nice  Great deal for the price, considering most titanium rings like this cost twice as much! The ladies really dig it! &lt;grin> <end>  sending it back  Need I say more....the picture looks as if the design run arounf the whole ring. It does NOT. There is 1 spot and it is toufght to see witht the high finish. <end>  not bad  The ring is quite light, doesn't even feel like metal.The image of the dragon is a bit blurry. It is comfortable to wear.My boyfriend liked it =] <end>  A Great Ring  This is a great ring. It's light, masculine, and feels quite comfortable on my hand. It scratches pretty easily, but hey it's titanium; what do you expect. Any scratches, however, only add to the charm of this fine piece of jewelry. Buy it now! <end>  Mens Wedding ring  After purchasing a ring on another site and not happy with the quality and the sizing was also incorrect, I purchased this ring off Amazon. The quality is exactly as described and the size is correct. Highly recommended. Thanks. <end>  Don't Order This Ring...You Will Be Disappointed!  I ordered the Titanium Celtic Beast ring as a gift and was truly disappointed when it arrived. Don't be fooled by the appearance of the ring's size...the picture is greatly magnified. The ring is very narrow...only 7mm in width...not a good width for a mans ring. The Celtic Beast design is SO SMALL that you really do need a microscope to see any detail. I sent this ring back for a refund...would not recommend!!! <end>  Tribal Ring  Although the ring first came in the wrong size, the company responded quickly to correct the error and I received the correct ring and free shipping to return the first one. The ring itself is quite nice and my son is very happy with it. <end>  Great ring for dragon lovers  I bought this for my husband's birthday and he loved it. Unfortunately, I was unsure of the size and the 15 was a little too big. He should have had a 14 and maybe even a 13. The ring was lost one cold day when he was raking leaves. We think the ring went into a trash bag, never to be seen agin.That is my fault though so I say to please get sized to ensure proper fit. Obvious advice but still good.I loved the dragon silhouette. It's nice looking in it's simplicity and you can still tell what it is. I say a great buy for dragon lovers at a great price. <end>  Way better than you think  This ring was far superior in quality than we expected. Nicely rendered graphic and fit is true to sizing. <end>  DH likes it...  He wanted something to replace his lost wedding ring and since he's always having to take his off for his job, this was the best idea. Price can't be beat, easily to replace when he loses it (yet again) and he likes the design. Sizing seems a bit off, ordered a 13 (his size) but it fits a little larger. <end>  celtic beast  I can't really rate this except from the day my son got it. Fit well and looked nice, especially for the price. My son went back to Iraq, for the 8th time, the day after I gave it to him, he liked it a lot when I gave it to him. <end>  It is ok  it is ok not great but cool. it gets scratched fairly easy. like from rocks. oh and it says titanium on the inside. <end>  My ring.  This ring is to be my wedding band when I marry in a few months. Since I work with my hands at my job, I needed something that could withstand the punishment better than a gold band. I had heard good things and bad about titanium rings, and have even looked at them at local jewelery stores. They are lighter than gold bands, as well. The celtic dragon insignia on the top of the ring also makes this ring stand out. <end>  Excellent purchase  Nice purchase for the price you pay for it. I didnt have a problem seeing the the design on the ring, it isn't huge but you can see it clearly without any problems. The ring fits nicely and have had no issues with it since my purchase of it a little while ago. I look forward to purchasing more items from this seller in the future. Thanks again great item, great price and a nice gift for any guy. <end>  Great pinky ring  If you like heavy jewelry that makes a statement, this is the ring to buy or any ring at this site. It was a gift for that special someone and they loved it. <end>  Dark  Its much darker than in the pictures but I dont mind. Very light and beautiful. Its titanium (a big plus) which doesnt give me a rash so big plus for that! <end>  he LOVED it!  When I found this ring, I knew it would be perfect for my boyfriend. So when he recived it in the mail a few days after I perchesed it, he was so happy. So if any women out there who are looking for a gift for a man in their life whether it's a lover, brother, husband, father, whatever, get them this or any other ring and they will love you forever. <end>  A great 1 year together present  My boyfriend totally adores his ring and I had our anniversay date engraved in it. Its a symbol of togetherness. <end>  Nice One  100% typical like picture, very good condition, perfect size, excellent service, I recomend this company and producy to everybody. <end>  Very detailed!  I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! He has an allergic reaction to some metals, so I was pleased to find a titanium ring that was priced well and intricately designed. The carvings are very nicely done, and the finish in the ring is superb. And the seller was very helpful when we had to do an exchange for a bigger size. Overall, a good buy. <end>  Great Service and Product  I received my order quickly and in great condition. The ring is very well made, heavy and the design is cool. High recommendations for quality and service. <end>  Cheap, feels like plastic  I bought this product thinking it would be good. First of all the size wasn't even right. I already had a size 9 ring and this one looked like a 6 or a 7. Second of all, it feels like plastic because its extremely light. Its made of titanium but it's very light. <end>
 B0002E47BM  Sterling Silver Star Pendant Hammered-finish Made in Italy, 3/4 inch tall ||	  Near Perfect Likeness of Saint Padre Pio  There are a number of Sterling Silver pendants of St Padre Pio that one can find in the market but not as near perfect likeness as this one. This pendant is also well made and I am very pleased with the overall quality. <end>
 B0002E47CG  Sterling Silver Large Script Initial Letter C Pendant w/ Cubic Zirconia Stones, 1 1/2 inch tall ||	  Bling!  This is a reasonable way to have a little bling around your neck.VERY pretty. <end>
 B0002E50NG  Faceted Oval Citrine Ring (size  6) ||	  It's not nearly as pretty in real life.  The stone is way more yellow and less November birthstone in real life. I never wear it because it's just not that pretty in real life. <end>
 B0002EXEOS  SON Travel Guardian Angel Visor Clip ||	  son travel guardian angel  omg I was shocked to open the package and see how big they r. they were better then expected, good quality, so pleased with this purchase.I purchased 1 for my son and daughter and grandmom for xmas gifts. <end>  Awesome!  I got the one for my son's new little truck and it is so beautiful. I know it just is a piece of plastic, but the symbol itheGOD and his Angels represted for me and my love for my son. I am terminally ill cancer and I need my touch on his truck and life and he can look at it and see my love for him to and GODS love we all need LOVE everyday a must Have item. for or loved ones. <end>
 B0002FGUIO  Lapel Pins (10-Pack)  Scholastic Award Pin - Merit ||	  Very nice, but a bit too small.  These pins are nicely made, with clear writing and sharp lines, but they're rather small. We had planned on using them as part of a uniform, but they're more suited as a lapel pin or tie tack. As long as you know they're small, they're good to go. <end>
 B0002FQBKQ  Sterling Silver Genuine Turquoise Cuff Bracelet with Dangling Feathers ||	  Dangling feathers very sharp!  I fell in love this bracelet, and I received it as a birthday present in October. By November, I had already had the feathers re-attached twice. Unfortunately, during a trip the grocery store I managed to break the feathers off for good. I only could find one caught in my jacket, so there was no point in reattaching just one. I tried to contact the seller to ask for another feather (I offered to pay!), but I got no response. So I had the feather made into a necklace charm (which is super cute) and addedA Little Howling Wolf Charm in Sterling Silverfrom the Silver Dragon. The bracelet is still cute without the feathers, and much less dangerous(!), but it definitely lost some of its character. <end>  Indian Lore  Sterling Silver winged heart turquoise cuff bracelet great buy. Good price fabulous look. <end>
 B0002FQBMO  Sterling Silver Genuine Midnight Sapphire Tennis Link Bracelet 7" ||	  sparkling and pretty  this bracelet is a great deal for what u get, it is very dark n black so canbe worn with black diamonds or black spinel. the clapse is solid n secure, though oddly flat, but nothing that takes away from the overall design. if u r looking for a 'black diamond' look tennis bracelet, then this is it. <end>
 B0002FQBOW  Sterling Silver WIDE Roman Ribbed Band Ring Size 7(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  In great detail.  This ring is a marvelous silver replica. If you look at it with a magnifying glass, you'll see all the little ornaments are crafted in detail, like the strings of minuscule dots on either side of the ring.When the ring gets a little tarnished, don't use a silver cleaner but take a soft cloth and rub the ring carefully. <end>  antique ring  This was a great ring. It looks just like the picture. I get compliments all the time. <end>
 B0002FQBXI  Mens Sterling Silver Gothic Wrapping SNAKE Ring size 8.5(Size 9) ||	  Good looking, but horribly fragile  I ordered this ring about three and a half months ago, and after wearing it nearly everyday, it recently broke literally in half (so now I have to "C" shaped pieces). I was taking it off, it fell on a hard surface from about two feet and cracked on the weld located directly opposite the snake "head" part. I was never excessively rough with the ring, so it had to be craftsmanship. Also noticed was that the silver plating had begun to come off rather quickly around the edges of the ring, and it turned black. The plating wearing off wasn't too bad looking but I was rather dissapionted when it broke in half in a situation were most rings would leave unscathed. I am giving it a two because it looks good and feels heavy, but is simply made to a standard not fit for everyday use. I would only recommend it to people looking to use it casually, once or twice a week. Otherwise, it will break, it is not a ring to wear everyday. <end>
 B0002FQCE6  Open Lily Flower Genuine Amethyst Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Purchased as a gift  But didn't give them away. The materials didn't meet my expectations. I'd say the quality is okay for the price though. <end>  Lovely earrings!  I get compliments when I wear them and they go with all my favorite purple outfits! <end>
 B0002FQCGY  Genuine Ruby Rectangular Small Stud Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  too delicate  The hinge isn't made to last, niether are the painted on polka dots.Not recommended <end>
 B0002FQCMI  Medium Celtic Knot Sun Cross Solid Copper Pendant and 20" Necklace ||	  Unique  I ordered this for my wife, for our (copper) anniversary. The actual piece has a deeper copper color, and less black than the photo depicts. The merchandise arrived promptly, leaving me pleased with both the seller and the product. My wife was happy with it, which means that I am as well.You've probably heard (accurately) that copper might turn your neck (or finger, or whatever) green. If this is the case, apply some clear nail polish to the pendant. You will probably have to swap out the copper necklace for something else, like leather. I realized this before the purchase. <end>  Great Product!  This is a wonderful cross, the copper shines beautifully changing from red to gold in the sunlight and the necklace as a whole is a great piece. As a man I wish that the chain were longer, however that is my only complaint and I am finding a nice leather cord for it to go on since I cannot find a longer copper chain. Once again I was very pleased with the cross and would definitely buy it again! <end>  Med celtic knot sun cross copper  This is a very nice pendant and chain. I am wearing it now and plan to wear itoften. I think you will really love this too. <end>  A wonderful necklace  I give this 5 stars. I always get positive remarks every time I have it on. The quality is quite good. <end>  Celtic Sun Knot Cross  My friends really liked this cross, she said that it spoke to her, so I gave it to her as a gift <end>
 B0002FQCMS  Sapphire HERRINGBONE Sterling Silver 17" Chain Necklace ||	  Pretty but Fragile  When I got this necklace it was a little thinner than I thought it would be, but it was very lovely. The shine was brilliant and the clasp was so pretty. I gave it to my mom as a birthday present. The very FIRST time she tried to put it on the clasp snapped off so that it needs to be sautered back in place.***EDIT*** I contacted the seller and they fixed the necklace in a timely manner. Keeping fingers crossed that this one holds up. <end>
 B0002FQCRI  Genuine Beaded Smoky Quartz and Sterling Silver Stretch Bracelet - 7" Wrist ||	  silver flexable braclet  A stunning piece of jewelery,Craftmanship is unpresidented as all that i have bought from silver insanity,Highly recomended. <end>
 B0002FQCS2  Freshwater White Pearl Stretch Bracelet Sterling Silver ||	  ABSOLUTELY STUNNING  THIS BRACELET IS SO PRETTY.I WEAR IT WITH MY WHITE WATCH AND MY ONYX BRACELET AND EVERYTHING.IT LOOKS SO EXPENSIVE AND FEMININE.I HAD PRICED ANOTHER ONE AT A JEWELERS AND IT WAS $100.00 !!!AGAIN SILVER INSANITY DOES IT WITH BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I CAN AFFORD. <end>  Very pretty bracelet, good quality  This was a bracelet I bought for my mom, and she wears it all the time. It is really nice, and I am considering buying one for myself! <end>  Great value  I gave this to my friend for Christmas. It's not totally her style but I couldn't resist, this bracelet is beautiful. Looks even better than in the picture. <end>
 B0002FQCUK  16" Sterling Silver 1mm Round Omega Chain Wire Necklace ||	  not durable  I had loved it at first, but I am one to leave a necklace on forever. It started to get all kinked up and I couldn't figure out how to straighten it out. But the company did offer me a discount on a different chain, even though it was past their 30 day policy. Nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it. <end>  Very pretty!  This is a very pretty omega that goes well with many different pendants, and looks great all by itself. <end>  Omega Chain Wire  The chain wire fits comfortably and is of good quality. It is less strong than I thought and so I cannot wear all my pendants. The fastener also takes a little getting used to. Still, it is good value for the money. <end>  beautiful!  The necklace holds a nice oval shape, depending on how heavy of a pendant is hung on it, without one its nice and round, and never loses its rounded shape. The wire itself is a wrapped wire, very sexy and high class. It matches the silver pendants perfectly and adds to the look of value for a necklace. <end>  awesome!!  I'm in love with this chain!! I really like my chain's to be shorter in length, but this one is just the best. It's sits so perfectly around my neck and lays so nice! The versatility of this piece is wonderful!! I love it!!!! <end>  Debsstuff  The 1mm sterling omega by Silver Insanity was well packaged, shipped very promptly and Just what I was looking for for my larger pendants that I didn;t want to wear on a plain chain. It fits also at choker length, so I can wear it with more of my outfits. I was very pleased with the seller's service. Also the price was very inexpensive. <end>  omega chain (very fine)  I purchased this chain for use with a delicate coral Celtic pendant I purchased for my roommate from college for next Christmas. (Yes, I'm already buying Christmas gifts). The chain is just what I wanted. It's in between a chain and a wire and a very fine guage. It's a shiny silver and very pretty. I did try it on and the 16" length was perfect. I was very happy with this purchase. It looks more expensive than the price. <end>  perfect charm necklace  great omega for any charm - 16" length is perfect for young women. The omega holds its shape and keeps pendants centered on the neck. This is a great quality product and an EXCELLENT value! <end>  Not what I thought  Not what I thought it would be. I shipped it right back. Doesn't even lay on your chest. Its more like a stiff wire. <end>
 B0002FQCWI  Sterling Silver 9" Chain Anklet with Dangling CZ and Purple Flower Charm ||	  Lovely Anklet  I bought this silver anklet, It looks really great! It's a lovely anklet...100% Satisfied <end>
 B0002FQCX2  PROTECTION Magical Talisman Amulet Pendant Necklace ||	  Great pendant!  For the price - this is a great buy! Colors are good - has a nice weightto it! Would buy more from this merchant. <end>  A gift for my Yoga Loving Wife  Doesn't mean its ONLY for a womam, this piece is one of many purchased from this vendor, and they will be seeing my business often (Holidays, Anniversaries, Etc.) <end>  Waste of money  This was a total waste of money. The pendant started losing its color in a week's time. <end>  Om Pendant  I was a bit surprised when I received a very Large pendant. I guess I was hoping for something more feminine and smaller, not large and heavy.Perhaps listing the size would have been helpful. <end>  Beautiful but Kind of Crap  I bought this and loved it, but after about a week the whole thing started tarnishing and no amount of polishing or cleaning made it better. Now I basically have a blakened piece of junk that is too ugly to wear. If I had to do it over again, I'd try coating the whole thing with a clear nail polish or some other kind of clear sealant to keep it from ruining like that. <end>  Quality piece.  The finish and quality of this item was quite good.PROTECTION Magical Talisman Amulet Pendant Necklace <end>  It's Small but Sexy!  I was a bit disappointed by the size of it. But it serves it's purpose by being small <end>  Dissapointed  The pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design. It does not go with the center design. I think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look. Pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either. <end>
 B0002FQCXC  Feng Huang PEACE Phoenix Magical Talisman Amulet Pendant Necklace ||	  Worth every penny....  I must admit that I was very impressed with this product when I got it. I love it and am hooked on it.... The amazing part is how cheap it is. If you love the phoenix. This is no doubt... The best thing to wear..... But you should but another chain for it, after wearing it two days my neck turned green. But the pendent on it is amazing.... Worth buying <end>  BEAUTIFUL  I bought this for my friend's son's welcoming party and it was absolutely beautiful. I would definately recommend purchasing this. <end>  Wonderful for the price  Got this as a gift item. It is really nice, particularly for the price.

 B0002FQCZU  Pentacle Silver-Tone Pewter Celtic Pentagram of Pan Pendant Necklace ||	  Great product  I recived the product with in the week that I ordered it. My friend was so pleased that she has not taken it off sence I gave it to her. <end>  So Beautiful!  I just recieved this item today...and when I opened the box I was amazed at it's true beauty! It took my breath away. This a pure and simple piece that belohgs on the neck of any wiccan! This is well worth how much I payed and you will see why when you order it.As far as the seller goes! I ordered it and 2 days later it was here! I have had 0 problems with them and I will be doing buisiness with them again very soon! <end>  Beautiful  This necklace is even more beautiful in real life than online. My only complaint is about the chain it came on; after I showered in it a few times it started to turn my neck green. But now I have a new chain and I constantly get compliments on it. An amazing buy! <end>  Beautiful  This is the first pentagram necklace I have bought, and the third item from Silver Insanity. All three times, the items were shipped quickly and with good packaging.This necklace is simply beautiful. It's not extremely fancy or anything, but the design is detailed, and it just holds a special-ness of its own. When I finally got to put it on, I really loved it. It meant a lot to me. Thanks Silver Insanity! <end>  Gorgeous  This is my favorite pentacle necklace that I own. I got it for my birthday from my father-in-law and it is absolutely gorgeous. I replaced the chain with a light-purple ribbon though... and I think that looks lovely. As the other reviewer said, the pendant is detailed and good work. The occasional green leaves on the silver-tone really makes the necklace, I think. Definitely recommended. <end>  looking forwar to this but...  I ordered this necklace because of the reviews and I liked how it looked. It got to me in decent time and when I opened it it looked as offered. The chain itself is cheap but because of reading the reviews I was ready for that and ordered a different chain along with it. I am glad I did because the clasp to the original chain is so stiff and nearly impossible to open. With the new chain it looked wonderful but by the end of the first day most of the green had flaked off of the pentacle. I really wanted to keep that extra pop of color on it and thought that it might stand up to at least a couple months of wear before it started flaking instead of a day. So because of the chain quality and the very limited life on the paint I have given it 2 stars. <end>  VERY UNIQUE!  I absolutely love the pan pendant. I have bought quite a few items from Silver insanity and was never dissapointed with the quality or the shipping. They are so fast and package everything carefully. I love the detail in this pentacle. I own a few pentacles, but yes this one has a specialness of its own. The chain that comes with it could of been a little better, though. I feel it's a little cheesy for the weight of the pentacle, so I too like the other reviewer replaced the chai. I bought an antiqued thicker 16 inch chain from Silver Insanity. I think it looks much better with it. Other than the chain this pentacle is perfectly beautiful and unique for the earthy witch!! <end>  Pentacle's beauty fades way too quickly  Since I am allergic to silver, I was happy to see a pentacle that was made of another kind of metal. I had been eying several other pieces from Silver Insanity and a few other makers. That's when I noticed the Pewter pieces. Pan's Pentacle is a beautiful piece of jewelry. The green and almost silver looking metal of the piece are gorgeous. The design is also unique and interesting.There are some problems that cropped up with extended use. The pentacle gets tarnished quick and is virtually impossible to clean. 6 months after wearing it the vibrant colors are gone, and all of my attempts to clean it have come to naught. The chain that came with it was also unfortunate. I specifically chose the design b/c it was made of pewter and not silver, and yet the chain itself was made of silver, so it was necessary to use another chain in order to wear the necklace (It was also not as good a quality as the pentacle). I was initially pleased with the purchase, but my inability to return the piece to its initial glory has soured me. <end>  PolarWings  Nice weight and size! Beautiful and very traditional. If you are an earth person, this is for you! It is great for Beltane! <end>  Troubles  I purchased this item and within about two hours of having it on, all the green came off! I didn't have it on in the shower, have anything rubbing up against it, or do anything to it that would cause it to come off. When I sent the company an email with my issues it took them a couple days to get back to me, actually after a week I sent the email again and then they finally got back to me. As much as I liked the design of it, I picked it because of the added color. When I explained that the color came off for no reason, I was told that I had to pay to ship it back and then they could send me a new one or I could just order a new one. To say that customer service was lacking is an understatement. <end>  I loved it, until the paint chipped.  This pendant was gorgeous when it first came, but after wearing it daily for a couple weeks, I noticed the green paint on the leaves was chipping off, and fading out. I'm not sure what I could have done to prevent this from happening. I didn't wear it in the shower and it was always on the outside of my clothes, so it wasn't rubbing against anything. Now the only thing I can do is either try to remove all the green paint, which would leave it looking really plain, or buy paint that I can use to repaint it, which would be a hassle. If I had known this was going to happen I wouldn't have purchased it. <end>  Christmas Present  My husband bought this for me for Christmas! It is wonderful! Darker then pictured, but even better! <end>  Pentagram of Pan  Beautiful, my only problem with it is that they didnt paint the leaves well, what i mean is half is painted and half isn't <end>
 B0002GXS6U  Snowflake Diamond Pendant 0.29 cwt - JewelryWeb ||	  This looks good with a white suit  My friend Barbara Boudewijn works for the EU somewhere in Brussels. No one in our circle is quite clear what it is she does for them. We've taken to calling her "Snowflake" because of what she keeps in a large aquarium in her livingroom  bamboo shrimp. They moult regularly, and often their skin can be seen peeling away and floating in the water like snowflakes. Barbara is fascinated by the process, and she sits on an ergonomic chair and watches them flake away for hours. I got her this tasteful snowflake diamond pendant in white gold. She took offense because she's sensitive about a skin condition that causes much of her forehead and temples to flake away like pastry crust. When I said "here you are, Snowflake" she took it as a reference to her skin condition rather than her bamboo shrimp. I corrected her, saying it is her bamboo shrimp that flake away like snowflakes, while her skin condition flakes away like pastry. I said if I had been referring to the latter I would have gotten pastries and said "here you go, Pastry." She would not accept my clarification. Naturally I was offended and said to her she cannot have this pendant, so I've taken to wearing it. It's quite tasteful. <end>

 B0002HIJE0  Guru Titanium Ring with Tension Set Garnet ||	  Stylish and strong but not chipped resistant  I bought one of these rings for my husband as an engagement ring. (I asked him, I figured it was only fair.) After four years together he still is very happy with the ring but we now have to replace it. While the strength of the tension has held the stone perfectly the garnet has chipped in 3 places. My husband does not do a lot of manual labor kind of stuff. His job is a software programmer and he never works on cars or other type activities that are rough on jewelery. We will most likely not replace his current ring with the same kind. <end>  Still In Love...with this ring  My husband and I purchased this ring as his wedding band. My husband spent a very long time picking out this ring and he still loves it after 5 years. We purchased the ring from the wonderful people at DiMarco Creations through Amazon. They were wonderful to work with and I will keep them in mind for my future jewelry purchases. The ring is very unique and many people comment on it. The setting is very squared on the sides so it does sometimes catch on things or scratch things if my husband is not paying attention, but this is something we expected due to the shape of the band. We have been very satisfied with the purchase of this ring. <end>

Overall, though, the product is high-quality metal. <end>  Tricky Color  This is a nice ring that my fiance actually wanted to have for his wedding band. It looks darker then it is...its actually light gray in the middle which he didnt really like. Lucky me the store was actually in my city (otherwise you can ship it to them) so i brought it back and they tried to make the middle part as dark as possible. No big difference but it was a little bit more then at first. The ring was a bit to big so we exchanged for a smaller size (no fee for all that)and since i was the one picking it up i actually engraved an inscription on the inside 15$ <end>  Very lightweight  This item looks like it would be a heavyweight metal, when, in fact it is not. It almost has a 'plastic' feel to it. Other than that, the ring looks like the picture. <end>

 B0002HJOWG  Leala Classic Titanium Ring with Grooves ||	  Beautiful ring!  I got this as a surprise gift. I was worried about the sizing, but it fit perfectly and he absolutely loves it. I have not had experience with titanium rings, but after seeing how beautiful it looked and felt, I would not mind ditching the classic gold band for a titanium one. If you're thinking about this product go for it, this ring is a nice, medium width band and looks great.The only thing that bugged me was the shipping, you could not pick what type of shipping you wanted, and it was $15, which with a total of $125 is a hefty price for some. <end>

 B0002HK9W0  Hitite Classic Titanium Band with Single Groove ||	  not very durable  I bought this ring a month ago and wear it every day. It seems to have quite a few scratches for being very new. Since I have an office job I don't do anything that would cause it to have so many scratches already. I assumed that titanium was more durable than gold or silver but I quess not. <end>  One ring to rule them all!  This ring is even more beautiful and distinguished looking than its picture. Be forewarned--titanium CANNOT be sized, so it is imperative that you get sized at a jeweler to make an accurate selection. Seller also shipped item sooner than anticipated.

 B0002HTQ7O  "FAT CAT" Sterling Silver Bell Pendant with Chain ||	  Beautiful silver "fat cat" bell necklace  I just received this necklace several days ago, and I am so happy with mypurchase! The necklace has a very good weight to it and is very shiney.Cute expression on the cat! The chain is also nice and can be used for other pendants, too. Delivery was very fast; nice packaging. I love cats, and I love this necklace! Thanks! <end>
 B0002I9ZHE  Dangling Bells Sterling Silver 7" Jingle Bell Bracelet ||	  Love this one too  It is pretty and makes me feel very girly. The jingle noise annoys one of my sons. I think it is the noise that makes me feel like like a woman. The matching anklet is pretty too. Definitely makes you stand out in a crowd! <end>  Awesome birthday gift.  My fianc&eacute; gave me this bracelet as a birthday gift and I just fell in love with it the moment I saw it. It makes me feel very girly and jingle attracts a lot of attention, most of it good. Recently, I've been going through a girly change of style and this is the perfect piece of jewelry to add to pretty much any outfit. <end>  not as loud as I had hoped  Cute but not loud enough. I love bells and finally found this bracelet, but was disappointed with the soft sound. <end>  GORGEOUS SILVER BELL BRACELET  QUALITY SILVER BRACELET - BELLS HADA NICE TINKLE TO THEM - ADDED ACRYSTAL HEART TO THE BRACELETAND GAVE IT AS A VALENTINE'S GIFT -WONDERFUL BRACELET <end>
 B0002I9ZJ2  Sterling Silver 9.5" Charm Link Chain Bracelet Anklet ||	  Sweet Charm Bracelet  I purchased this bracelet for my daughter for Christmas. Since her wrists are a little large, it worked for her perfectly.Fast shipping and excellent service.The bracelet is beautiful, well made, dainty and she loves it.I have purchased from Silver Insanity before and always have very good luck with them.Again, this is a dainty bracelet; if you are looking for a heavier one, this will probably not fill your need. <end>  Dainty and beautiful  I purchased this as a gift for my fiancee and have yet to give it to her, but upon inspection I am VERY satisfied with my purchase. The links are smaller than I had visualized, but it's not a bad thing. It just makes the chain that much more feminine.Quality upon first glance seems solid. It looks like a nice piece of silver jewelry. Love the look of the double links.Highly recommended, especially for the price. Will follow up if I discover any negative aspects of it. <end>  very elegant for an anklet  I purchased this item not knowing what I was going to receive....................Upon receving it...........I was very impressed on its weight, and appearance,I love it and well worth it. <end>
 B0002IBKJK  Sterling Silver Bracelet w/ Crystal Hearts, 8" by Paris Hilton ||	  Stones fall out - very disappointed  I love Paris, I love her jewelery but was very sad that one stone was missing when I took it out of the pouch. I loved it so much I was willing to overlook the flaw but a few weeks later I noticed 6 stones missing. I am not hard on my jewelery but this is obviously a quality issue and I will be sending it back for a refund. <end>  Not exactly as advertised  I received my earrings and bracelet today and I love them.....EXCEPT, the clasp on the bracelet is a regular Lobster Claw, NOT with the heart detail as the picture shows. For that I am a little dissappointed. Otherwise, I love it! <end>  Star/Heart Bracelet  I was very dissappointed with my bracelet. The stones fell out. I ordered a second one and the same thing happened again. Hopefully they will resolve this problem. It is a very cute bracelet and hope there will be remedy for the problem soon. I'd like to have another one. <end>  stones  I really like style the bracelet I ordered. However, the first bracelet I received was missing a stone. A replacement was sent and one of the stones is close to falling out and I haven't worn it yet. Quality is not the best. <end>  Love it!  I've had it for months now and the quality is great. I haven't lost a single stone and it does have the engraved crown on it. It's the same as it was the day it came in the mail. I love it so much that I wear it everyday! It goes well with all of my clothes and hasn't given me any problems. <end>  So Paris  I like the bracelet and I think it's beautiful.Just two notes The blue cristals are paler than I expected.The clasp is not heart shaped and it's very hard to open.Like a lot of other buyers, I already lost one cristal. So the bracelet don't look so special anymore. <end>  Cute, but is it worth the price?  I don't own the bracelet but I wanted it for a while and then changed my mind. I give it 3 stars because it looks great but its a bit pricey and people complained about the stones falling out. You could probably find something similar at Claire's for way less then what you would pay for this. <end>  I love it.  Can be worn with casual wear or out on a evening. This is so cute. I love it. <end>  It's HOT  I find Paris Hilton's new jewerly very CUTE and also affordable. I mean, i love Paris, but I'm not writting this just because I love her. The jewerly is pretty, and affordable. Its great because it is real sterling silver but its also a celeb brand. Most jack up the price because of the name, but her's is reasonable. I have to say.... it hot! &lt;3 <end>  No heart clasp  [...] When ordering jewelry view all the enlargement pictures. Saves a disapointment later. The only heart clasp is on the anklets. It is a very nice lobster clasp on the bracelet. The crown tag on all Ms. Fields pieces adds a wonderful touch. D. Bishop <end>  w/ Crystal Hearts, 8" by Paris Hilton  This bracelet is so cute~~Paris make more ~~I love them so much~ <end>  love it  Very pretty. I havnt had any stones fall out of mine. It shines really nicely and matches with almost anything. LOVE IT! <end>  Great braclet  I recivced my first of paris hilton jewerly. I read other people comments about the stones fall out but mine are all there. Maybe paris has revamped in making her jewerly better since Since last post was made regarding the quality of the jewerly, I am very happy with my Paris Hilton purchase,I cannot wait to new pieces of Paris Hilton Jewerly. <end>  Bracelet w/ Crystal Hearts  A great gift for a special friend or girlfriend. The stars and hearts show her how special she is to you. <end>  Cute Bracelet  I think this bracelet is cute and because it can go up to 8 inches in length it means you don't have to be really thin for it to fit your wrist. <end>
 B0002IBKJU  Sterling Silver, Stainless Steel and Crystal Heart Belly Bar, 1" by Paris Hilton ||	  sweet heart  One of my fave belly rings. I just bought my 2nd one (seems I lost the 1st when moving) The 1st one held up for me. It didn't lose stones or anything like other people said. 4/5 stars only because it is fashion jewelry. It isn't piercing quality body jewelry that can be left in for a year or whatever. It's for going out then you put your stainless steel ring back in after the weekend. Body piercing professionals will tell you the same to avoid infections... and oh yeah, remember to clean your body jewelry too! <end>  Piece of Junk - Don't Waste Your Time or Money  I purchased this product after seeing the beautiful portrayal of it on the Amazon.com website. When it arrived, I was very excited to open the box & see my beautiful new belly ring. To my extreme dissapointment, the heart looked more like a disfigured jelly bean & pops right off the post with little effort. I'm sending it back immediately & will never buy a Paris Hilton item again. <end>  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT  This belly bar is as cute as the star one and I can't believe how cute it actually looks. I would definitely recommend it! <end>  Pretty but short lived  For the year it stayed on, I loved it. Then the heart came unscrewed and it fell off without me even knowing. I wouldn't buy another product of Paris's because jewelry should last longer than a year when properly taken care of. <end>  Very pretty with a tanned tummy  I love this belly bar, it's very pretty but you need to have a tanned midsection or it kind of gets lost. But I get a lot of compliments on this at the pool and gym. A nice piece to have if you like to change your belly jewelry. <end>  sexy bellybutton ring  I bought this bellybutton ring and within days two stones fell out. I contacted Amazon and they replaced it for free. It is a sexy belly ring. I have never seen one close to it in any stores or online. The pink stones go from light to dark which is cool. You can't tell it is in the shape of a heart though unless you get close to it. I added a pink stone ball on the top to replace the silver/metal one it came with, which makes it even better. Overall I am enjoying it. <end>  belly button got infected  like three days after i put it in, my belly button got infected. i guess im more sensative than others but i was really disappointed, it was so cute!!!  ( <end>  B-E-A-UTIFUL  My siter just got her belly pierce and this looks just georgeous on her. the quality, the color, and the fact that you are not going to find it in a store at the Mall makes it a unique piece.Don't mind the people that don't read. <end>  Great Jewellry... What's Next for Paris...  I understand NASA are in talks with the heiress (does she know how to operate a hotel chain?) of Hilton Hotels. They want her to apply her never-ending talent to design the new reusable shuttle. Apparently it will feature a lot of pink and faux fur.Will wonders never cease? Paris can do ANYTHING!!! <end>  very pretty and girly  This belly button ring and the star hoop earrings are my favourite pieces from the whole line and when they are both in stock I will definitaley be buying them. <end>  Hilton Hearts  My daughter & neice are extremely best friends, sometimes act a little silly and clueless about work type things, we enjoy watching the show on TV and Paris/Nicole make us think of our girls as well. They both have their belly buttons pierced and these are beautiful - the girls will love it! <end>  Really cute....but not the best quality  I bought this and when I opened it up thought it was the cutest thing ever....but I have only had it for 2 days and already 2 crystals have fallen out. I know that it wasn't that expensive of a piece but two days isn't that long and it's covered up and so it's not getting mishandled. But, the good thing is that it is very hard to tell where the two have fallen out and if you don't point it out to someone I would be surprised if they noticed. I would say that for $15 it's pretty much worth it because it is really cute and I've not seen one like this before. <end>  Oozing rash from belly ring  I've had this belly ring for about 2 months when I noticed an oozing open rash on the side of my belly button. Turns out all the plating on the backside of the heart had worn off and it became really rough. Watch out for this if you buy! I've had my belly pierced for 4 years and this has never happened to me before now. <end>  uncomfortable when sitting  I am unable to wear this comfortably when sitting. Also, a stone appeared to be missing so I can't even ebay it (I got it as a gift and no receipt) <end>  Nice, but not best quality  I just received my belly ring a few days ago, and initially thought it was really cute and original. But already, 2 crystals have fallen out  ( Like it, but wish the quality was better. <end>  infected...  To the person who mentioned there belly button got infected,Did you disinfect the jewelry before you put it in? You should ALWAYS disinfect a piece of jewelry yourself if its going to be "in" your body, no matter what part of the body, earrings too. Even if the comapny selling the jewelry states that they sterilize there jewelry before packaging and shipping, you should still take steps to clean first.Thats PROBABLY why you got infected, also "cheap" metal alloy like silver over brass, will cause an infection, taking the jewelry out regularly and wiping it down with alcohol or some other disinfectant will also help keep away infection.That said, I think that this is a really pretty piece and fits my piercing wonderfully. <end>  Crap  All the crystals fell out of this ring and the metal came off the back. Will turn your belly green! <end>  Best Belly Button Ring Ever  I got this on Christmas day, I haven't taken it out since and I don't plan to. I love this, it is very unique in the way the color graduates and the heart is misshapen. No crystals have fallen out so far, after reading some of the reviews i guess i'm lucky. It is also quite cheap for body jewelry, especially body jewelry designed by Paris Hilton. <end>  So pretty....  I absolutely love my belly ring! It's gorgeous and i've had it at least two weeks and none of my stones have fallen out like some other people that reviewed it. Maybe i have been lucky.  ) I still think it's worth the money. I'm the first of anybody i know to have one! <end>  My New Fav. Belly Ring  I got this expecting it to just be a "weekend" piece of jewelry but I have had it in for almost 3 months now. I hav't gotten infected, green skin, loose pieces or anything that was mentioned in some of the other reviews. This is one of the most comfortable pieces of body jewelry and I plan on wearing it for as long as possable. <end>  Great!  I think this belly ring it very cute. I've been wearing it for about a month now and I've had no problems with it. I like how the ball on top is actually smaller than most other belly rings; it makes it look less chunky and more petite. <end>
 B0002IBKR2  Sterling Silver and Crystal Heart Pendant on Satin Cord, 16" by Paris Hilton ||	  Heart Necklace  My boyfriend purchased the Heart Pendant on the sation pink cord last year sometime. I wore it maybe 2 times and it broke. the cord came completely out of the clasp. He fixed it for me, then the clasp broke. I would not recommend buying this necklace. From what i see, others have had the same problems as I have. ~Amanda <end>  Falls Apart   (  My boyfriend bought me this necklace for our anniversary last year. I loved it because it was the only piece of jewelry that he had ever got me and he knew that I am obsessed with Paris Hilton. Soon after I started wearing it, the satin cord came undone from the clasp. I quickly replaced it with a stornger silver necklace. Then, one by one the swarvoski crystals strated to come loose and get lost. As of now, three of the eight crystals are missing. The only reason I still wear it is because it reminds me of my boyfriend, imperfect but thoughtful. <end>  Unique and with glitz!  I have really enjoyed this piece. It turned out to be bigger than I expected, but a pleasant surprise. Love the pink with the silver and the rope is definitely a nice way to hold the piece. And it's pink! I too can see how the engraved 'Paris' can be a bit of a turn off, but it's part of the decor in regards to the piece. In my case, this was given to me by my fiance who proposed in Paris, so we made the engraved part work for that memory. <end>  Satin Cord Falls apart quickly & the piece is overpriced  I was very disappointed when I bought this piece for my daughters B-Day. It looks like a cheap piece of junk and is very overpriced. there is nicer jewelry on sale in the stores for the same price. The satin cord pulls loose from the clasp within 2 weeks and cannot be reattached. Your only choice is to return it as defective or buy a thin chain to replace the cord (defeating the "pink" look). There are similar reviews here for the satin cord issue, as well as stones falling out. I am surprised & dismayed that Paris would allow her name to be placed on this garbage. THINK TWICE. <end>  Paris  My daughter will love this pendant as she is a Paris Hilton fan but I as a consumer think the product is of fair value. The pink string it hangs from is already kinked from shipping and will fray or break with wear. The pendent itself (cute) seems to be worth the money spent. Overall I give it a 3 -middle of the road product. <end>  Necklace  I'm not sure on this necklace, I think that it looks cheap. If girls get it because they want to be like Paris then at least get the rosary bead cross necklace (Paris has been seen wearing this a lot). I like most of the Paris Hilton jewellery the worst buys being this and the star necklace on the cord. If you want to buy something from her jewellery line I would recommend that you get one of the necklaces with a real silver chain not a cord chain that will get ruined easily. <end>  Cheap, nothing special.  This is not a unique piece and I do not really care for how it has "Paris" engraved on it. The heart is smaller than I thought it would be and the satin cord is too short for my taste. It is also cheap quality. It's way overpriced for what you get. This necklace is worth about $10, maybe. <end>  Great Product, Looking for More Paris Hilton!  I just love this little necklace. It has super quality as well. I enjoyed the packaging, information etc. Class Act! <end>  Too cute!  I bought this as a birthday gift for my sister, and I love it so much I'd like to buy one for myself. It's a simple, elegant piece that would be easy to dress up or dress down. The shade of pink on the satin cord and the crystals is very pretty. <end>  Everybody says it's cute!  I am very satisfied with this item! It's actually 5 stars for me, but I give 4 stars because I think it can go well with you IF your fashion taste and your atmosphere suit this item. I like pink very much and this item matchs my clothes and character and so I can use this frequently. If this item is suitable to your clothes and personality, everybody will praise it and you! <end>  totally not unique...  As mentioned before, this necklace is almost exactly like the Elsa Peretti Carved Heart pendant by Tiffany's. Both have a silky cord and carved out heart in sterling silver. Although this one is pink and jeweled, the main difference between the necklaces is in the quailty. <end>  Girlie and cute!  I think her collection is very feminine and cute..I could wear it or buy it for my little sister! <end>  cheap knock-off of elsa peretti  who are we kidding here? this is a complete rip-off of the classic elsa peretti heart pendant. i hope tiffany's sues. <end>  PeOple  i think that this necklace is very intholistal because it shows a side of fimical and dimation so yes do by it <end>  Hard to believe anyone would buy it.  I suppose that if you normally shop at a dollar store, this might be for you. Actually you probably get better quality at a dollar store. "Swarovski crystals" are fake stones made in China. Not a natural crystal. <end>  !!!!  My mom is buying this for me on my birthday. It is a wonderful accessory, sure to match everything I wear! And I'm kind of glad it says "Paris" on it cuz girls think she's hott so if I wear it, it'll be like I'm hott, too! The only reason I give this 4 stars, is because I have to wait for my birthday! <end>  paris hilton  I love paris hilton !!! She is just soo cute and funn and entergetic. I love this necklace it is soo cute.!!!! I LOVE YOU PARIS!!!!!!! <end>  upset that i can't order this in Canada!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I really like this, but cannot order this as it will not ship here to Canada.................grrr <end>  didn't have it yet ~~  My beloved husband order this pendant for me for my birhtday and i'm still waiting for it to be shipped !!!really can't wait to wear it in front of my family they gonna envy me !! <end>  alright  i like parises line of jewelry,and my daughters name is paris i just thought maybe she might have something with the name paris on it if anyone finds something ingraved with paris will you please email me thanks <end>  Not for me.....but our teen loved it  This was a gift to our 17 year old and she loved it. I thought the silver heart was a little big, but nice. However the satin cord was cheap looking and after wearing it twice it broke! Amazon was very quick to replace it (3 days) so she was happy. <end>  Very Happy!  I bought this necklace for my sister's 18th birthday. It was by far the best gift that I've ever bought for anyone! I was hesistant, having never shopped on-line before, but I was ecstatic by this purchase. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested. <end>  Worst purchase ever  This was one of the worst purchases I have ever made. This thing is a cheap piece of garbage. It looks cheap, it feels cheap, it IS cheap. Don't waste your money on this nasty necklace. It not only looks like something you get out of a gumball machine but it's not made with any kind of quality either. If I could give this a rating below 1 star I totally would. I hope this necklace burns in hell! <end>  Thats hot!  i LOVE this necklace!! it is so pretty and the perfect accessory!! Paris is sooo cool! i love the jewelery in her line ! keep up the great work,Paris! LUV, BEC <end>  kool  Everyone who bags out The paris hilton collection r probably haters of paris hilton. The fact is that this piece of Jewelery is not what I excpectted from my great aunt from the u.s. She's 45 yrs old and she advised me on this peice of jewelery for my graduation! I was like what the. This piece is probably going to suck because I'm not a huge paris hilton fan however when I wore it it felt light on me . When i wore this to my graduation people were like woahhhhhhhh who designed that and all.it's pink and i was extremely surprised that some of the coolest girls were staring and talking about it. it was pink blazing and stood out from the crowd. Now me and my friends religously buy paris hilton collection jewellery . <end>  looks really cute, but is it worth it?  When I first saw this piece on Amazon.com, I seriously gasped. It is sooooooooo cute! And since it is from Paris( my idol) i knew I must have it! Sadly, though when reading other's review, some complain of the crystals falling out, the satin cord falling apart, and the piece being extremely smaller than expected. I mean, I want a nice piece of jewerly, I want it a bit big for others to notice it. I want the cord to hold up for a long time, and I really want the stones to stay in place!!! I mean, for $35 of my OWN money, its GOT to be nice! <end>  I LOVE PARIS!!  The Paris Hilton jewelery line is awesome! Everything is soo cute and elegant. I also want to wish Paris a happy 24th birthday today! Paris you are awesome, keep up all your good work, you have a ton of awesome fans!! Love Sarah <end>  Great Necklace!  This necklace is great. The satin cord is so trendy, and the heart is very pretty with the pink diamonds.I am only 13 years old and plan to get all the other pieces most likely the star necklace and earings. Maybe if I get my belly button pierced in the future I'll get the belly button piece. Anyway the price was right too! <end>  Great Gift but??!  It's a nice Pendant and it has a beautiful design, but if i can write my name on it would be more beautiful <end>  That's hot..  I like the necklace and I think it looks adorable on. I can't believe on the other hand I paid $35 for it just because Paris Hilton's name was attached to it and I love novelty stuff like this. Sure it looks like some other stuff that has been released but it's jewlery...most of it looks the same anyways.So if you have the money and don't mind spending it order away. Everytime I have worn mine since it has arrived I have gotten tons of compliments. Besides we have to let Paris Hilton make a few bucks of her own  0 <end>
 B0002IGHSY  Turquoise and Sterling Anklet ||	  Beauty wrapped around an ankle  This anklet is one of the prettiest anklets I have ever worn. The beads are multicolored turquoise which is very appealing. It fits very well and the extra links allow for comfortable adjustment. I love it! <end>
 B0002INIYK  Antica Murrina Laguna - Blue & Gold Murano Glass Ring ||	  A lovely piece of jewelry.  I just received my ring. It really is lovely. It looks like the picture with a little difference in detail due to craftmanship. Each one is going to be a little different. I am very pleased with my ring. When thinking about ordering it I wasn't sure how it would look on my hand so let me give you a general idea. If you are thinking about buying one of these rings keep in mind they are only one size. A size 8. The ring is shaped similar to a dome ring. It is rather large and would probably look better on people who are medium to large build. I am an average size lady, (about a 10-12) but I have long fingers. The colors are just like they are in the picture. Sometimes with photos it is hard to tell if you are seeing the true colors due to lighting, etc... So point is what you see is what you get. The ring lays flat to the finger and the design is covered with a glass dome around it which brings out the beautiful colors in a 3D effect. As lovely as it is it took me a few minutes to get use to the size of the ring. I think it is more of a ring to wear by itself. It might overpower any other jewely you wear on that hand. I am already looking forward to purchasing another unique piece of jewelry from this collection. Oh and by the way, I ordered this Wed. night 10 30PM and received it by 10 00AM Fri. morning. (The item ships from Italy so your looking at a fifteen dollar shipping fee).May of 2008, Update I still love this ring. I wear it often and continue to receive compliments. It really is a little work of art. <end>  Fantastic  I have received the ring after 5 days ordered. It is so beautiful, the wrapping is lovely. It has been packed carefully. I am fully recommended.Thank you <end>  Forzieri ring  I bought this for my jewelry fanatic friend because I thought it would be an unusual and cool gift. I ended up ordering one for myself. It's so unique, like a glass sculpture. They are very beautiful and comfortable. I recieve compliments all the time. They also deliver very quickly in very nice packaging. <end>
 B0002IONGM  14k Yellow Gold 16 Inch X .7 mm Box Chain Necklace - O Ring Clasp - JewelryWeb ||	  Great buy  The chain looks thinner that I expected. However, the quality seems very good, although I am no jewelry expert. I got 2 for my twin boys who are 5 months old. They wear it with their Christening cross pendant and it looks very handsome. Furthermore, they are at the age where the pull at everything that gets into their tiny fists and this chain, although thin, has been up to the abuse. <end>
 B0002IONJ4  14k White Gold 20 Inch X .8 mm Box Chain Necklace - O Ring Clasp - JewelryWeb ||	  Beautiful, but not O Clasp  This necklace is beautiful, shines and lays very nicely. The clasp is not an O clasp, but a very tiny lobster clasp that is very hard for people without nails or people with arthritis to work. I have to put it on with the clasp in the front and in front of a mirror. I fumble with the clasp a lot, it's very difficult to put on.

 B0002IOPFG  14k White Gold 24 Inch X .8 mm Box Chain Necklace - O Ring Clasp - JewelryWeb ||	  Better than expected.  I was a little afraid to order jewelry online but this chain is great.

 B0002IROOK  14K Yellow Gold 1/4 ct. Diamond Men's Wedding Band (Highest Quality) ||	  Perfect Quality  I was very satisfied with my purchase. The quality was so good, that the picture doesn't do it justice. They were very prompt in delivery as well. <end>
 B0002IROPO  10K White Gold 1/4 ct. Diamond Wedding Band ||	  Great ring for a great price  I ordered this ring as my wedding ring and it was absolutely what I was looking for. The price can't be beat...and the shipping is the best bargain on the web. I paid $1 for overnight shipping and the ring was on my door step in less than 24 hours. <end>  Ideal!  This is an unfussy and very attractive ring! I purchased it as a replacement for my lost wedding ring. It stacks beautifully with my engagement ring and is also perfect on its own, catching the light with an appealing luminosity. <end>  Beautiful ring for the price  I was worried purchasing online, but the ring turned out to be beautiful. Against my engagement ring, the diamonds do look a little yellow, but for the price I can look past that. <end>  ring  This is by far the worst ring I ever bought. Within the month the gold was showing through, they wouldn't let me return or give me my money back, and I was allergic to something in the ring and it made my finger break out in sores. The company didn't seem to care much. I will never buy anything from this company again. <end>  Diamond band  I thought the ring matched a wrap very well that I had bought, but when compared to the clarity of my diamond it was not a match and without the wrap that didn't fit my setting it was not flush so I returned it. <end>

I have delicate and small hands so I do not mind the size of the ring...actually I think it is perfect.

I am gving it too her for Christmas. <end>

 B0002K8TH4  10.72 TCW Oval-Cut Mystic Fire-Colored Cubic Zirconia 18k Yellow Gold over Sterling Silver Ring ||	  FIVE STARS PLUS THOUSANDS  This ring is gorgeous. It looks tremendously expensive. The colors sizzle and I believe it could be worn with any color to perfection.There are blues, purples, greens, rose, and fiery black shades at some angles it appears to be sapphire, at another it appears onyx, at another emerald, etc. I love rings on each finger and now I cannot do that when I wear this ring, because everything else next to this looks meaningless. I have rings much more costly and they are just lost beside this ring.This ring is large and beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about it...BRAVO! I would wear it with my best formal wear or my daily jeans and not be worried it can carry any look with success. <end>  THE RING THAT WILL MAKE YOU GASP!  When I first opened the box to see the ring, I actually did gasp! I was in awe of this ring's dazzling beauty. I love cool jeweltones, so the purples, blues, pinks and greens that twinkle from this ring while being surrounded by cubic zirconias are just gorgeous. I have a lot of nice rings, some real and expensive, yet this is the ring that I've gotten the most compliments on. <end>  Nice ring...

 B0002KS8WA  3 mm Brushed Center Comfort-Fit Women's Wedding Band in 14k White Gold ||	  Not bad, but I don't think I will buy from SZUL again.  I had placed my order directly from the Szul website (on Nov. 22, '06) as I didn't want to wait for the 3-4 day processing mentioned above. I don't know if this made any difference with the speed of processing/shipping. I just got my ring today.The picture above isn't the best representation of it. In real life, it actually looks a little 'plastic-y'. It almost feels like it too because it is quite light in my hand. However, at least as of now, the ring is comfortable on my finger and I like how it looks. I will be wearing this ring on my left hand ring finger - the brushed center is chafing against my middle finger little, I just hope it doesn't get worse over time.I'm a bit wary of Szul, I read some feedback on Amazon about problems with shipping and customer service. For me, customer service was efficient enough. The thing that got to me was that I was told twice that the item "will be shipping today", they told me this on two different days. First on Nov. 30th.Dec. 5th came, I called for a tracking number, seeing as they had said that it had shipped already. They say that it didn't ship on Nov. 30th because it needed to be resized and that it "will ship today".Of course that got me worried, I didn't understand why they bothered telling me that it shipped on the 30th and no one said anything about resizing.It seems like in dealing with customer service, email wouldn't be the best way. In emailing, their responses were delayed. Basically, you really won't get anywhere if you plan on just emailing them. It's not a problem to call, the people you speak to are nice BUT I don't like that you have to call them to sort of nudge them about your order and having them do something about it. It didn't quite feel like a smooth transaction.Well, eventually they did give me a tracking number. (FedEx 2 day - shipping was free at the time of my purchase) and at least I got the right size and the item arrived the next day after talking with them.I also read alot of positive reviews/experiences about Szul, but it seems like it's almost like a luck of the draw. You may have a good experience or you could be up for annoyance or mishaps. Of all the companies/sites that I have ordered from online, I've never experienced this kind of 'wishy washiness' I guess there's always a first and I know that it's not a perfect world.I don't think I will be ordering from Szul again. I'm still not sure weather I would recommend buying from them.All in all, I think Szul just has alot to improve... <end>  Not bad, but I don't think I will buy from SZUL again.

 B0002KXXZ2  6 mm Brushed Center Comfort-Fit Men's Wedding Band in 14k White Gold ||	  Good looking, doesn't stand up well over time  My husband really loved this ring. It's very simple but not your typical shiny, plain band. The problem is that the finish gets scratched really easily - it already had scratches by the end of our wedding weekend! You have to look closely to see them so only we know about them but it is disappointing. But we decided for what we spent it was worth it. Eventually we'll be able to spend more on something of higher quality. For now it looks good from the distance from which most people see it. <end>
 B0002KXZF0  3 mm Plain Domed Comfort-Fit Women's Wedding Band in 18k White Gold ||	  excelent ring  i liked so much this ring, it was what i was hoping for...the only problem was timing, because they had some troubles to send me the ring and came almost a little late.excelent and beautifull product... <end>
 B0002LB2TK  Brilliant Spa Personal Steamer ||	  Jewel Jet spits hot water  I bought my Jewel Jet directly from the maker and was happy with it for a brief time. It began to "spit" burning hot water even when no water had been added, so it eleminates the theory that the unit was too full. Two years later, my Jewel Jet is unusable because of smoke, not steam, seeping through the button on top. There is no doubt that this is an electrical issue. <end>  Works just like jewelery store ones.  I got this as an Xmas gift for my wife. I had my doubts but it does just what you'd expect it to do. Fill with water, heat and blast. Leaves rings etc. looking bright and sparkly. This is not a substitute for real cleaning (ultrasonic etc.) it is the final polish step. The blast of steam is much greater than one would imagine. Using many short bursts, as advised, never caused any lack of pressure. Bottom line  impressed, good product. <end>  Jewel Jet Drama  I just purchased the unit and followed the instructions to use it. All the steam just flows out of the top from the cap. I sent the manufacturer an email. Well see what happens next. Good luck to all new buyers. <end>  Warning - Need Sonic Cleaner Too  I got this for my ex-gilfriend, but it wasn't what she'd wanted. Apparently this device is only meant to be used after you've already washed your jewelry in one of those sonic cleaners. It gets the dirt of out of little cracks the sonic cleaner couldn't into. I think this is probably obvious to discerning women, but to any guys who just don't know, make sure to get your girl a sonic cleaner first if she doesn't already have one. <end>  Cleaner  Bought if for a present and my g/f uses it about once a month and it does a good job of cleaning up our jewelery. <end>  Disappointed.  I gave this as a Christmas gift to my Mother. The funnel was missing and the tweezers were not where they should have been for a "new" purchase. For the price I am very disappointed. <end>  Jet steamer  The steamer works very, very well. Sure beats paying for, or even just the hassle of taking your stuff to the jeweler and wondering if you got back what you took in. Great gadget. <end>  Jewelry Steamer  Nice product. Works very well. A bit large...a smaller version would be easier to leave out on the countertop. <end>  works well and well worth it!  Just a quick note to share our expirience with this item. My wife, and subsequently all of her girlfirends love this product. We have had it for over a year now and it still cleans well and is easy to use. The reason for only the 4 stars is because I feel like the should offer interchangeable heads that would allow for a more concentrated stream of steam when need versus a wider one spray when desired. Overall, great product and a good value. <end>  Works great!  I decided to purchase this item based on others' reviews, and I love it! I thought my rings were clean before, but now they sparkle so much more! This cleaner is easy to use. It's not too big for storing. And, though it comes with cleaning tablets, it cleans just as well on its own. It doesn't require any extra cleaners. I'm very glad I invested in it! <end>  sparkling jewelry  why wait to get your jewelry sparkling clean when you can do it at anytime with the jewel jet steamer...you get professional results without leaving your house <end>  great steamer  this steamer works great and my wife loves it for cleaning all of her jewelry to get them sparkling clean. <end>  Excellent  I read all the reviews before buying this home steam cleaner for jewelry. Based on the reviews I decided to purchase the steamer. It worked very, very well. I am most pleased with the results. I would recommend it highly. <end>  Better than expected!  I was very surprised at how well this actually worked. I expected a relatively weak 5 second burst of steam, but it is so much stronger than I ever expected. The steam comes out nice and hot with very good pressure, and it lasts long enough to clean several pieces of jewelry. I did have quite a bit of steam leaking from the top of the steamer (where you pour the water in and screw the cap back on) but I don't think I screwed it on tight enough. Overall I am actually very pleased with this steamer...it should keep my rings nice and sparkly without making trips to the jewelry store  ) <end>  Great Value  I bought the Jewel Jet for my wife and she absolutely loves it! Her jewelry looks better than ever. Thanks <end>  Cheap  We used this product no more than 30 times before it broke....first the red ready light went out, then it stopped working all together....after emailing the jewel jet company, I was told that I would have to buy a new one...NOT, I will give another company a try...other than that it cleans good... <end>  EXCELLENT RESULTS  I ordered my unit directly from Jewel Jet. Aside from receiving the unit in a box that was severely damaged as it was drop shipped in its own box, I have no complaints with it working as advertised. The unit is quite large so you may not want to leave on the counter but the results are SPECTACULAR. It definitely out cleans my Sonic Cleaner. I have not been able to see a difference between this and the results after I get my jewelry steamed at a large retailer like Fortunoff. I first used it on a G Color VS stones, but it has caused me to start pulling out pieces of lesser quality that I have not worn in ages to give them a revitalizing breath of "fresh steam" and I still label the results as SPECTACULAR. I love that I am achieivng these great results with just adding tap water. With my own experimenting, I honestly couldn't tell a difference when using after precleaning pieces in a detergent solution as a competing model - that uses BOTH detergent and distilled water - claims. <end>  Works as well as any jewelry store steam cleaners  I purchased the Jewel Jet in hopes of being able to keep my wife's rings as clean and sparkling as when we have them cleaned at a jewelry store. The results after using the jewel jet are as good (if not better) than when we do have them professionally cleaned. The machine is light and easy to use. Just fill the top with 8 oz of water, wait three minutes, and push the button. It is that easy and the results are wonderful. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their jewelry looking as new as the day it was purchased. <end>  Buyer Beware...Not for Most Jewelry  The user instructions provided with the Jewel Jet Steamer caution against steam cleaning most gemstones except rubies and diamonds. After some online research I learned that steam cleaning is not recommended for tanzanite, emerald, topaz, etc. You can read more about this at http //www.andrewberry.co.uk/gemstones_care_of.htm. Although the Jewel Jet cleans most diamond and ruby jewelry, you will need use the "soapy water and soft brush" method for everything else. If I had known that steam cleaning was so limited, I would not have purchased the unit. That's probably why there is no warning about steam cleaning jewelry in the product write-up. I should have done my research before ordering. <end>  GREAT PRODUCT  I am impressed with how easy this machine is to use. The directions are straight forward, and the machine is ready to use almost immediately after plugging it in. Some reviewers said that this was a HUGE machine, but I didn't think it was big at all. It cleaned my diamond rings and other jewelry really well. It even shined my gold bands that had become quite dull (I didn't even notice how dull they were until the Jewel Jet made them shiny again as I was trying to clean the diamond on my ring). Overall, I think this is a great product, and I enjoy the fact that I no longer have to take my jewelry anywhere to be cleaned. <end>  7 years owned and STILL LOVE IT  This is a very well put together constructed Steamer, I have owned this machine for 7 years and counting, I steam my ring sadly every other day if not every day. I first use a delicate liquid cleaner and then I dry it and Steam it, I get results that are beyond amazing, I love to keep my jewelry shine going. I honestly believe anyone who purchased this item and USED IT, would have nothing negative to say, in time you will learn to hold your bracelet with the jewelry tweezers provided. I clean my necklaces, bracelets, ring and Studs and so can U. I too wanted something that would not have me running to the Jewelry Store every week, I go every six months and do this daily. SO, GO for it, you won't regret it.It is August 9, 2009 - I just got finished cleaning my rings, chains, husbands earring, and wedding ring. WOW, the diamonds sparkle like none before. The unit hasn't let up yet, it has went through daily use after daily use for months then down to weekly use at other points, you will love it. Weather using long spurts or short spurts you'll get the hang of what your jewelry like and your preference. The price tag is worth it. TRUST and believe it last. 7 Years and counting, Still loving my Jewel Jet that sits on my kitchen Counter.  ) <end>  Awesome product!  I love being able to clean my rings without chemicals, which I am usually allergic to. This product is tops! I only wish the tank was larger so I didn't have to refill as often; however, I still highly recommend it. I love the way it gets the gunk out from the back side of my rings just behind the diamonds where it is very hard to clean. <end>  love it  I love the jewel jet because it is exactly what my jeweler uses except now I can clean my diamond at home when I want.It is easy to use. Just follow the directions. <end>  Works as advertised  Easy to use and effective. Jeweler quality cleaning without making the extra trip. I highly recommend this product. <end>  Very good for all kinds of jewelry.  This is a great product if you have LOTS of jewelry. This cleans everything perfectly, no more harsh chemicals. Very fast and sufficient. Certainly worth the money. <end>  BEST 99 BUCKS I EVER SPENT!!  I purchased this little beauty after reading the reviews posted here. After using it once all I can say is WOW! It is so easy to use. As soon as I received it I grabbed my fianc&eacute;s diamond engagement ring and put it to the test. The results were AWESOME! Her ring looks beautiful. I was going to buy one of those ultrasonic cleaners that you can find at the local gadget store in the mall but I wanted something close to what the jewelers use. This product is great and does the job better than I could have anticipated. <end>
 B0002MR9DW  Silver Forest Hummingbird Dangle Earrings ||	  beautiful!  I received these earings rather quickly and when I opened the box, they were just as I imagined. They are light and delicate. The earing is also three separate pieces so its cute when it dangles because the three pieces move. Also, you get what you pay for because the color seems to be painted on and I hope over time it does not fade away. Nonetheless, I like them and would recommend purchasing these earings. I have received many compliments on them  ) <end>  Beautiful!  As with all Silver Forest items, these are great quality! Loving everything about these!Purchased for my wife as a Christmas gift. She's happy! <end>  ELEGANT!  pictures do not do these earrings justice! they are absolutely elegant!beautifully crafted! antique look to them!!! BUY THESE AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! <end>  Pretty earrings  Purchased these as a Christmas gift for a daughter-in-law who loves hummingbirds. I like the three colors, and although they are a bit smaller than I expected, they are very pretty. They arrived promptly, and I'm sure she will like her gift. <end>  bough as a gift  Bought as a gift. They look nice. Personally, I wouldn't wear them but I have a grandmother who loved hummingbirds and these are right up her alley. <end>  hummingbird earrings  Just got my 2 pairs of SF hummingbird earrings. They are just as beautiful as I thoughtthey would be and go great with all the green clothes I wear. I got one pair for myself and the other was for a friends birthday. She loved them too. The earrings were shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.The only negative is this company does not participate in the SF sticker program. (buy 5 pairs, get 1 pair free with the stickers.) <end>  Silver Forest Hummingbird Earrings  This is the third pair of these earrings I've bought (Not all for myself! Two pairs for gifts. They are beautiful, and I absolutely love them. The ones I gave for gifts were greatly appreciated. Since buying these, I've purchased another pair of Silver Forest earrings and love them too! <end>  These Earrings Make a Wonderful Gift  I purchased these beautiful earrings as a "just because" gift for my Mom and she loves them. These earrings are great and it's hard to beat the price. I received them within 3 days of purchasing them, which was well ahead of the estimated delivery date. <end>  humming bird earrings  As with all my Silver Forrest collection of earrings , I was delighted when these arrived. Shipping was fast and a breeze. <end>  beautiful, elegant, and under 20 bucks!  i ordered these Earrings, for my mom's birthday, she loved them and really are proud of them, i will be doing business with this company again, the order was processed very quickly and arrived several days before the actual due date! i would highly recommend this company for business <end>

 B0002PE1GW  Moonstone necklace, 'Cascading Light' 1" W 16" L ||	  Beautiful Idea  I LOVE the style of this necklace -- it is beautifully made and quite unique.The stones are not as vibrant as I was expecting; a friend of mine has a pair of moonstone earrings that provide an incredible rainbow effect which set my expectation of what moonstone looks like...When I saw this necklace I was disappointed because the rainbow was not as obvious. I've given it a chance and have worn the necklace with more vibrant colors and the stones pick up the colors and compliment just about everything.When I thought I was going to return the item, the customer service people were very helpful and responsive.I have decided to keep the necklace and will wear it often.I would have given it 100 stars if the stones had a stronger rainbow to them, but they are more milky with strong cat's eye quality; while not exactly what I was expecting they've grown on me and I love the necklace. <end>
 B0002PR25Y  Silver Forest Turquoise Filigree Earrings ||	  turquoise earrings  These are really pretty. I love Silver Forest earrings. Wish I could find merchants who honor their earring club. No one seems to carry the card/stickers needed to receive a free pair. <end>  beautiful  These are just gorgeous. I received several compliments on them when i wore them to work. seller was prompt. very satisfied with service. <end>  Disappointed  I was very disappointed when I received these earrings I ordered from Amazon. They are very small and the "turquoise" background is actually plastic with a small piece of turquoise mounted to the metal (not silver). When I purchased these, they were advertised as sale priced from $40 to $18. Now they're advertised at $13.50. These are not the quality I expected, and I won't be ordering jewelry again. <end>  Cheap Earrings  Watch out with these. I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart. The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off. They are useless now. Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive. The back of the earring is a flat separate piece of plastic and is not connected to the metal part of the earring so it flaps around.These are cheap and fall apart quickly. <end>  elegance in turquoise  I ordered these earrings for my daughter. She loves them and said they are the most elegant turquoise earrings she has ever seen. <end>  Very nice earrings.  I would buy jewerly from this buyer again. The earrings where nice and shipped right away! <end>  SHOULD HAVE LISTENED  Before I purchased these earrings, others had commented on their poor quality. These are cute but not really a very high quality. <end>  beautiful earrings  Package arrived promptly and in good shape.Loved these beautiful earrings.I ordered them for a gift but almost kept them for myself.May have to order another pair for myself. <end>  Beautiful earrings  Purchased with a necklace on amazon and these match perfectly. The size is just right and they are so unique that I get compliments on them. <end>  beautiful ear rings  received ear rings and very very happy with the quality, color and style. Will purchase another pair for my daughter. The only down side, is it needs some kind of backing. these come off my ears without me knowing it and I don't want to lose them. Otherwise, they are great!!!!! <end>  LOVE IT!  Bought for a gift and they look so good want to keep for myself! I am impressed with these earrings. <end>
 B0002PYLEE  Doberman Pincher Charm -XAC369 ||	  Nice but thin  I love this charm- I just wish it was a little thicker. It is a thin piece of gold and even sounds thin(if that makes any sense). It was a gift bought for me off my wish list- if I spent the money myself, I would have returned it. <end>
 B0002PYWRA  Cat Charm -XCH377 ||	  Cat Charm  Love this charm. I purchased two so that I could attach them to hoop earrings. Highly recommend. <end>
 B0002PZ6GQ  Golden Gate Bridge Charm -A1069 ||	  Better than the photo...  This is a great looking and great quality charm that looks much better than shown in the current photo. It has a nice weight and a solid feel. Unseen in the picture it also has the words GOLDEN GATE engraved on the underside of the bridge deck - which is also curved rather than straight. <end>
 B0002RQN70  Masini Vanita' - Blue Murano Glass Stone Ring USA 6.5 | UK M | IT 12 ||	  Awesome quality and design  I am very satisfied with the ring, it looks exactly as on picture and even better.

 B0002SSXHM  Irish Shamrock Bracelet - SF295 ||	  FABULOUS!!!

 B0002ST434  Snowman Charm -K205 ||	  What you see is what you get  I love this little snowman charm. I got it for my sister for Christmas. It's adorable. This is my 2nd order with this company and I have no complaints. The items always ship fast and they arrive in attractive boxes or bags. <end>
 B0002TA1W6  Medium Sterling Silver Endless 2" Hoop Earrings - 50mm Hoops ||	  Great quality!  I love these earrings. They are beautiful and very good quality. Sometimes the endless hoops can be flimsy, these are nice and substantial. Still very light in the ears though. I think I may buy another pair soon. <end>  Great Earrings  I was looking for some silver earrings, but not expensive. These are great for the money and they were the perfect size. Love them!! <end>  excellent hoop earrings  I got these earrings for my wife who only wears hoop earrings and is very particular. She loves these earrings. They are the right size, good quality and they do not give her ears a rash like some other earrings that are cheap. Excellent price as well. <end>  Nice and Lightweight!  I love these hoops and the light weight of them, and they don't irritate my ears like some of the cheaper ones I have bought. I usually buy them cheap because I have a habit of losing earrings a lot (I often end up with only one of a pair). The price for these is reasonable enough that I won't be out too much if I lose one, but I will be bummed if that does happen. However, the wire insert for the closure is very long and I'm not as worried about them falling out as I am of damaging them when I'm closing or opening them (which is why I'm only giving them 4 stars) . The delivery on these was super fast. I received them overseas at an APO address within a week of ordering them. <end>  Great everyday hoops!  I already have a pair of these great hoops and wanted a 2nd pair...just in case i loose 1 earring. <end>  Great Earrings  I like these. They are big and shiny fun earrings. You will love these. They are a great addition to any wardrobe! <end>  GORGEOUS!  I ordered these for myself and I was extremely impressed! I am a perfectionist and can be picky so I knew what I wanted - sterling silver, not too big and not too small, but larger than the 20mm hoops I already had, and not cheap looking. When I received these earrings, I was very pleased! Not only did they have a beautiful shine and solid feel but they were the PERFECT size; just what I was looking for! <end>  everyday wear  These hoops are the perfect size. I used to wear large hoops, but now that I am getting older, this size is great! I wear them almost everyday. They are super shiny and really light weight but substantial. <end>  Wearing earrings now!  Product came on time,( maybe a little early) as described, and ready to wear...I needed cute hoops that were not made of cheap metal...they suit me well! <end>  Gorgeous!  Hoop earrings. What more can you say about them? LOTS! They are beautiful and just the right size. They hang low enough to look classy but not so low you'd require a nameplate necklace. They are so beautiful, my girlfriend wears tehm pretty much daily now and she looks fantastic. Worth every penny!!! <end>  Great Gift  While they were a lot bigger around than I realized they are narrow so they still work. They were a gift and she liked them too so win win. <end>
 B0002TA1WG  Small and Simple Mother of Pearl Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Christmas gift  I bought these for my sister for Christmas and she absolutlely loved them! <end>  Elegant earrings  These earrings are very pretty and classy. They are simple but very beautiful, they arrived quickly and look great. I was worried because I have purchased earrings in the past that looked good online but once they arrived they looked cheap. This isn't the case at all. I recommend them. <end>  pretty, but small...  I was pleased when I received my earrings, however, they're smaller in reality than what's pictured on the website.But, they're still pretty! <end>  Beautiful earrings, but...  I ordered nine pairs of these earrings, all of which are really beautiful. I was somewhat dismayed to find that they were all shipped in the same pouch, instead of each in their own individual pouches. I was planning to give them as gifts, each wrapped in their own pouches, but will now have to find other wrapping materials for them. <end>  too small  These earrings would be GREAT for a little girl under 13 NOT for a grown woman <end>  I had some issues  The earrings themselves are nice, they say Mother of Pearl but the person I bought them for instantly thought they were a soft stone such as Opal. These earrings are very small though and the ones I was sent were very dirty. I did have some issues at first with shipping as well. I was sent an empty green pouch the first time in the mail. I contacted the seller and they VERY quickly replied and sent me the pair I gave someone. <end>  Very attractive jewelry  This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. It is just what she wanted and the photo depicted the actual item perfectly. <end>  Beautiful, elegant earrings  As another reviewer notes, the picture simply does not do justice to these earrings. They are absolutely lovely. The mother of pearl is so lustrous and pairs beautifully with the silver setting. Delivery was super fast and I was very pleased with every aspect of my purchase. <end>  Mother of pearl  The mother of pearl is really lovely. The picture does not do justice to these earrings!Great earrings especially for the price. <end>  My Favorites.  These earrings have been my favorites for the last 4 years. I wore them from the second I took them out of the box. They are a perfect size for everyday wear, not too heavy or ostentatious. They are tasteful, simple and elegant- and will match almost *anything*. I have recieved tons of compliments over the years.At any rate I am thrilled to see that Silver Insanity & Amazon still carry these, as I left my first pair in Costa Rica after a wild night out in Quepos. <end>  Great Gift  I bought these earrings as a gift for my mother. She loves mother of pearl. She likes her jewelry small and simple rather than big and bulky. She absolutey loved the earrings. I also found a mother of pearl ring on amazon that matched the earrings perfectly. <end>
 B0002TG9IG  Diamond Love-Knot Pendant in 14K White Gold ||	  My daughter loved the diamond love-knot pendant  My daughter had seen this pendant and my husband and I tried to discourage her from wanting it because we didn't know that it would be what she really wanted. We were afraid it would be really tiny and she'd be unhappy with it. However, she loved it and it was perfect! <end>
 B0002TGA8U  14K Pearl & Diamond Pendant ||	  Wel made, not Cracker-Jack  For the money & value, I'm very happy with the item and so is the wife. It is real gold, diamond & pearl and fit into my weak-assed budget for a 30th anniversay gift rather well. Roll Tide. <end>
 B0002TPH6Q  Single Ice Blue Rose Belly Button Ring ||	  Don't buy this.  The only reason you should buy this is if you want to wear it for one day. I was wearing this for signifigantly less than a week when I realized the inside of the "rose" was gone. I didn't care that much because it was cheap, but still, it's not worth ordering unless you realize it'll be good for one wearing and don't mind. <end>
 B0002TPH70  Single Limon Rose Belly Button Ring ||	  Wonderful!  I bought 5 of these in different colors for my Wife, aside from the bar being just a little too long for her (she had a shorter one to use) she absolutely loves them and switches them out to coordinate better with her mood and outfit. If there were more colors available, especially black, I would buy them all! <end>
 B0002TPPJU  Single Violet Rose Belly Button Ring ||	  pretty but painful  this belly button ring is beautiful, but unfortunately the petals are very sharp. after wearing the ring for a few days I had to take it out because the petals were cutting my belly button. I tried to flip it so the rose was on the top of my belly button, but it stuck out too far and got caught in my clothes. I really hate not being able to wear this piece because, like I said, it is beautiful, but it's not pretty in a belly button that is cut to pieces! <end>  Wonderful!  I bought 5 of these in different colors for my Wife, aside from the bar being just a little too long for her (she had a shorter one to use) she absolutely loves them and switches them out to coordinate better with her mood and outfit. If there were more colors available, especially black, I would buy them all! <end>

 B0002U3VZY  ST. CHRISTOPHER MEDAL PENDANT OVAL 8X7mm 14K Yellow Gold ||	  Pay attention to the size! This is really tiny.  This is a beautiful medal and I thought the price was too good to be true... buyer beware... this is a very tiny medal (I have never seen one sooo small!). If that's what you're looking for, you'll be thrilled. When I opened the box, I was amazed... Get out your rulers.. Do you really know what 8mm looks like? <end>

 B0002V3R0M  Trillion Cut Sapphire and Diamond Ring 14K White Gold ||	  Exactly as pictured  My fiancee wanted a sapphire ring rather than a diamond and specifically wanted a trillion cut, dark sapphire. This ring was exactly what she wanted and matched the picture perfectly. She was thrilled with it.

Just got them yesterday and so disappointed as I was looking forward to wearing them. However the packaging is superb. <end>
 B0002V4W74  Hawaiian Plumeria Flower Bracelet ||	  Not what I was looking for  I purchased a plumeria anklet in silver from a local vendor and since they do not carry a matching bracelet, I ordered this one hoping that it would be a good match for the anklet that I have. The price was comparable and the picture online seemed close enough. However, the delivered product is much too shiny and 'cheap' looking. I will upload a photo as soon as I am able.NOTE  This particular bracelet may be enjoyed by others, it just did not meet my needs. <end>

 B0002VG6VY  Medium to Large (M/L) Size 14k Gold Endless 2mm thick Hoop Earrings 1 1/2" (1.5" or 38mm diameter) ||	  My new favorite earrings!  Years ago I had a pair of 14k gold endless hoop earrings. I don't believe mine were as large as these. Anyway, I asked Santa to bring this pair to me and, WOW, I am very pleased with them! They are the perfect size and light weight, yet feel sturdy. Even though I am 55, I feel these earrings are not too "over the top"! <end>  Great!!!!  My first initial review of observing the gold endless earrings is that they were a little thin from what I expected. However, they are large and it has a beautiful shine. Having slanted eyes these gold endless has really emphasized on bringing out my eyes and I LOVE IT!! Delivery was prompt and they consistently kept me updated about the shipment via email. I'm really happy with this purchase. The closure is definitely a plus. <end>  very pretty and comfortable  I had a pair of earrings like these but much lighter. These are nice size but still lightweight. I like the look of them very much. I do not wear heavy earrings since I have seen what they do to earlobes after years of use. I like the 'endless' hoop since it seems safer to wear around small children-if they pull on one it's more likely to open rather than tear the earlobe. <end>  Great earings!  Got this for my mom for x-mas.They're not too small or big,just right.Perfect gift for moms. <end>  Large Gold Hoop Earrings  These are terrific earrings and are reasonably priced considering their large size. Like the previous reviewer said that she slept with them on and they stayed in, I had the same experience. I also wear Sennheiser over the ear cupped headphones to listen to mellow music to fall asleep. The earrings stayed on and I didn't have to go searching in the bed for them the next morning like I had with other hooped earrings. I also washed my long hair and they withstood the turbaned towel on my head. They look great, have substance to them and most of all--THEY STAY LOCKED. <end>  Large endless hoop gold earrings  I was so pleased to find these earrings. I had been looking everywhere for many months for this style. These earrings are special because they are thicker than the average endless hoops but light enough to be comfortable. I leave them in all the time. <end>
 B0002VJ06C  Genuine 10K Yellow Gold Length Adjustable Heart Anklet ||	  great value  i was looking for a anklet for a mother's day gift. None of the local stores had one so I took the chance and ordered thru Amazon. The price and quality are great <end>

 B0002VM5JQ  ST. CHRISTOPHER MEDAL PENDANT 12X9mm 14K Yellow Gold ||	  st, christopher's medal  This medal is quite a bit smaller that the typical st. christopher's medal, but very nicely rendered. I bought it for my wife and she is very happy with it. So far, it has not turned her neck green, so I'm guessing it is real gold. The gold is a nice change from the usual silver. <end>
 B0002VR6ZE  Contemporary Asian Jewelry Chest / Box (horizontal) - rosewood, 8 fabric lined drawers ||	  Rosewood jewelry box  Rapid receipt. Well packaged to prevent damage in transit. Disappointed that back of jewelry chest is plywood. Description on Amazon.com was misleading, claiming chest made entirely of rosewood. Therefore, item is overpriced. <end>
 B0002VRRVW  Sterling Silver Grey HEMATITE Poison Box Ring Size 7.5(Size 6) ||	  Cool Novelty!  I love this ring! It looks great and feels comfortable!

 B0002VRTA6  3mm Sterling Silver 18" Inch Black Rubber Cord Necklace ||	  You get what you pay for.  After wearing the rubber necklace for less than one month, the necklace broke, leaving me with a useless pendant. The moral of the story is  You get what you pay for. <end>
 B0002VRTAQ  Sterling Silver 3 Stone Garnet Choker 17" Inch Necklace ||	  Good necklace!  This necklace has good quality garnets, and is quite nice. I took a star off because the silver is not finished off very well - the edges are a bit rough and could have been polished to a nicer finish. <end>  very cute  I bought this to go with my prom dress and it was SO pretty. For its cost, I didn't expect anything stellar but no one really examined it too closely anyway. Unfortunately I lost this while moving but if I could order another one, I would! <end>

 B0002X0AVY  Cute Stretchy Hematite Bracelet ||	  Neat huh!  The stone in this bracelet looks like a metal. It is shiny and bright. Nice bracelet for a man or woman! <end>  Lasted less that week.  Bracelet is strung together on strecthy band type string. Found it to be very bothersome to wear due to it expanding on wrist with any kind of arm movement. Finally on about 3-4 time wearing while at work and moving arms it stretched too far and broke and the piecec went flying and some shattered. I wouldn't buy this again. I recommend something more strung together with wire type string. <end>  Shiny!  This bracelet is about 7 inches (18 cm) around and stretchy. As apposed to many of the coolstyle bracelets, the fibers used to keep this together are very thick and black. The beads are very shiny and dark, this could easily be given as a gift to a man or a woman. <end>
 B0002X4P0Q  Sterling Silver HUGE Golden Faceted CITRINE Pendant ||	  Lovely  I bought this to give to one of my bridesmaids as a gift. I was so happy when I received it..and she was as well. It is a substantial piece without being too big. It makes just the right statement. The colour of the stone was true to the picture, and the price was right! <end>  Really pretty & eye catching!  I put this item on my wish list - any my wonderful husband made my wish come true by getting it for me...and it's really spectacular. You can see some slight areas where the silver filigree welding is not top notch, but overall good quality for the price. The !WOW! factor that people have to seeing it is great. <end>
 B0002X4P60  Sterling Silver Lady in Moon Genuine Amethyst Dangle Pendant ||	  Pendant quality was poor  I bought this pendant as a gift for my daughter. Pendant was received in a timely manner. Very pretty but crystal fell out within weeks. <end>  Really pretty  bought this as a gift for my mom and she loved it.

 B0002XP1OA  Sterling Silver Intricate Detailed Filigree Long Slide Pendant ||	  Beautiful!  Pendant is beautiful and looks even better in person. Many people have commented on it. The back has a different design than the front--wear it both ways for variety. <end>  buyer beware  This pendant looked horrible when it came in, it appeared to almost have a white powdery look to it- definitely not a shiny silver finish like in the picture. It was no way worth the price and the sellers took over a week to respond back, I returned this item and it took them almost a month to refund my money. <end>
 B0002XP1QI  Sterling Silver Red Agate Filigree Heart Locket Pendant ||	  Stunning!  When I received this necklace as a christmas gift, it was absolutely breathtaking.

 B0002XYRFY  925 Sterling Silver Purple Psychedelic Heart Toe Ring ||	  Not Too Bad  The ring actually isn't too bad, I got it for a friend and ended up keeping it for myself after I got something a little nicer for her. The ring itself is sturdy and it looks good, perfect for warm weather since it's flashy, but still comfortable. All around it's not a bad ring. <end>
 B0002Z43QA  New 10K Two Tone Gold 4mm Ring Diamond-Cut Wedding Band Size 9 ||	  Eve & Steve from PA.  I ordered this ring to replace my old one. This ring came quick and is beautiful. My husband saw the ring & wanted one for himself, so I ordered him one too. This ring is very comfortable to wear & it really sparkles! Also, it is really worth the money. <end>  Just OK  I wanted two weeks before I received the ring. The Ring is rather pretty. But the waiting is too long a time. Hope it could be faster next time! <end>

I found out several days after I ordered this item, that it was unavailable. I did finally get a refund after much headache between contacting this store and contacting Amazon. What got me the most was that there was no communication between this third-party and Amazon. Nothing was correct on my account. And worst of all, nobody ever changed this item to show that it was unavailable! I worry about some one else making the same mistake.

 B0002Z7LQY  Ornate Sterling Silver Adjustable Spoon Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11) ||	  Beautiful spoon ring  Love this traditional looking spoon ring. you can wear it for casual to dresser style outfits. It blends to make that prefect look. I wear it at work, going out on weekends, etc. I would recommend it. It's true to size. <end>  Nice ring...but...  Nice...but once you have adjusted I would HIGHLY recommend to bring it to a jeweler and have it soldered. Makes a structurally stronger ring. <end>
 B0002Z7LYG  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Amethyst Drop Hook Earrings ||	  earrings  These earrings are adorable, they are light weight. You dont even know they are there. <end>  Stunning  I bought these as a gift, they are beautiful, loved them when I received them, the person who got them also loved them, great quality and they look exactly as the picture shows them. Love the whole collection they had the earrings are really a great find! <end>  Very Nice Silver Jewelry  These earrings were bought as a gift and I was very pleased with the quality given the price (very good price). The silver looks really nice and they are well made. Beautiful piece of jewelry. <end>  Delighted  Absolutely thrilled with this product! So delicate, feminine and beautiful. The stones are not as dark as they look in the picture, however I still adore these earrings. Another fantastic product from a great company. <end>  NICE!  Really nice and lovely earrings  true to image, beautiful stones and qualityProduct arrived in time, in nice packaging, important, too. <end>  a great gift  I bought this for my mother and mother-in-law.They both loved it and they look high-end earings.The only thing I didn't know and I didn't like was they are heavy and it shows when you are wearing them. <end>  Celtic delight  The quality of these earrings is excellent. They were originally bought as a gift but I liked them so much I also bought some for myself. <end>  CHEAP LOOKING!!  I ordered these as a gift they looked so pretty online and they got good reviews so I decided to purchase them. BIG mistake!! They are very cheap looking. I realize I didn't pay that much for them but I could have Bought a $5 pair and they would've looked nicer!! You can tell on the earrings where the stone has been molded into the other part of the earring...absolutely horrible!! The reviews for it have to be fake! I have learned my lesson not to buy jewelry online. <end>  Nice but cheap looking  The metal looks like it was poured into a mold so looks a little to manufactured. I was hoping for a little irregularity that would make it look more handmade ... still, I am sure my wife will love it. <end>  My wife loved them  I gave these to my wife for Christmas and she loved them. I deducted one star because the back of them 'look' a little cheaper than the front. <end>  These are pretty!  I wear these a lot and I just love how they look on me. They show up on me real well,they are bright and shinny. <end>  Pretty  Very Nice earrings for the price. They have a little of that authentic look to them which I love. I bought these for my mom for christmas and she loves them. Very Pretty! <end>  =)  My boyfriend bought these for me for our 6 months. I absolutely love them! =) <end>  Beautiful Item  Beautifully crafted! Perfectly crafted, and includes a sterling silver hook, for those with nickel allergies! A perfect gift! (That's how I received it) <end>  Intricate and beautiful  Silver insanity rarely lets me down and most certainly hasn't with this amazingly intricate Celtic knotted dangle earring set. The amethyst was exactly the color shown in the pic and the product looked heavy duty and well made whilst retaining a definite feminine feel. Not overbearing but not tiny either I felt I definitely got my money's worth with this pair.Treat yourself for less than the cost of a couple of lattes! <end>  Nancy  This product is the same as the ring, very good looking and the person it was purchased for is very pleased. <end>  Silver Celtic Knot Amethyst Drop Hook Earrings  I didn't expect the earrings to be so beautiful, and they're really easy to wear <end>  beautiful  Silver Insanity continues to produce gorgeous items of Celtic jewellery. The drop hook earrings come with nice size Faceted Oval Synthetic Amethyst Stones. Very light weight. Looks like you would pay 4-5 times the price. Silver Insanity just delivers time after time. <end>  Gift for a friend  These were a gift for my best friend who loves amethyst and celtic knot jewelry. They arrived in a gift pouch, and the stones were a good color. She loved them. I was very pleased with my purchase. <end>  OK but not great  I was a bit disappointed in these earrings. Although pretty, I wish the quality would have been better. They look nice on though. <end>  Small but Cute  These earrings are smaller than I thought they would be. They look very beautiful when you look at them from far away, but up close they look sloppy. They have a lot of scratches from production that were just polished over instead of being sanded out. Also, one of the earrings dangles in an odd, off center kind of way. Since they were so inexpensive, I am going to keep them and I'll wear them when I see grandma, since she can't see that well.  ) <end>  About what I expected  These earrings are pretty, but the quality is certainly not top of the line. The casting is a little rough, and the stones are just so-so. You basically get what you pay for on these. If you like the design, they are nice to have, but not good enough for out on the town. <end>  Nice Earrings  These earrings are very pretty. Maybe a little flatter than I thought from the picture, but still very nice. <end>  Great  These are so beautiful. I've ordered a few pairs of earrings from SI & I have found them to be durable, cute & a good match to the online picture. <end>  My New Favorites!  These earrings are beautiful and I plan on purchasing the necklace that goes with them. They were received promtly and in excellant condition. <end>  Very Beautiful!  I love these earrings! The price was perfect and the shipping was so fast.They are just what I was looking for. They are beautiful!I will absolutely shop with Silver Insanity again!ThanksColleen K. <end>

 B0002Z7M22  Large Sterling Silver Mens Gothic Cross Ring(Sizes 9,10,11,11.5,12,13,14) ||	  a masculine ring for someone who may not normally wear a ring  I first found, and bought, this ring in a booth at a large 'biker' event - Bikes, Blues and Barbeque - a fe years ago. I'd been wanting a ring for some time, but never found anything that appealed to my tastes - masculine but not gaudy or overbearing/overlarge. I've gotten numerous compliments on it from strangers....and was sad to let it go when a lady-friend asked for it as a keep-sake (lol).I missed it and wanted to replace it, but was skeptical that I could find anything that fit 'me' so well. I began searching Amazon under men's rings..and I was thrilled when I found the exact ring here.This ring actually even sparkles - glinting off the edges - in sunlight. I gave one to my best frined for his birthday the other day and his wife and daughters love it on him. <end>
 B0002Z7M86  Sterling Silver Yellow CITRINE Poison Ring Size 4.5(Size 4.5) ||	  SS Yellow Citrine Poison Box Ring  The seller was very slow to respond (minus 1 star) to my email (days). I actually ordered the ring before I received a response.The citrine stone is light but it is clear and shiny. The stone is more yellow than the picture shows. However, I wanted it more on the yellow side. The silver is nice and shinny and not antiqued like the picture shows. The quality of the ring is great and it is very pretty. It is true to size.It arrived on time and it was packaged well. I have shared this sellers site with many friends. Great prices and great quality. <end>  Attention Grabber!  I received this item off of a wishlist I had created for graduation and I love it. The picture can be a tad misleading because the Citrine is actually very, very light (like a watered-down apple juice) but it's still pretty.Every time I wear it, without fail, people always stop to tell me how much they like it. It makes your hands look very delicate and feminine, which is nice the ring is a nie weight and size  it's not to bulky and it doesn';t have a tendency to catch on things.I give this ring 4.5 out of 5 because the picture is misdleading, but otherwise it ROCKS! <end>  Sterling Silver Yellow Citrine Poison Box Ring  I'm very satisfied with this ring. the descriptions match the actual product. The reason why I gave this review 4 out of 5 is because the shipment was 5 days late, but other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase. <end>  not as it looks in the pic  the product looks great in the pic, but actually it is toooo small and the material looks cheap and you can bend it with your 2 fingers. <end>  Just treat it gently?  I love the ring, I had some trouble with the stone coming out of it but the seller was very nice and replaced the ring. I really can't complain. And for the price I would still recommend the ring and I would most definately recommend the seller, "Silver Insanity". They shipped very quickly as well. The ring is slightly smaller but brighter than you may think from the pics. And it runs true to size. <end>
 B0002Z7MBI  Sidhe Sterling Silver Celtic Birth Charm Pendant for May 17 - June 8 ||	  beautiful!  On time, nice packing in a cute velvet bag. Charm comes with a small book on Celtic birth signs. This birth charm is adorable!Has nice antique look to it. I wear it all the time with a black silk cord chain that I purchased with the charm. It is eye catching - people always ask me what is it. <end>  Dissapointed  This was a very pretty charm until the antiqueing wore off. Now it's a ulgy charm................Not for everyday wear. <end>

It blends to make that prefect look. I wear it at work, going out on weekends, etc. I would recommend it. It's true to size. <end>  Nice ring...but...  Nice...but once you have adjusted I would HIGHLY recommend to bring it to a jeweler and have it soldered. Makes a structurally stronger ring. <end>
 B0002Z7NBC  Pretty Sterlng Silver Filigree Dragonfly Hook Earrings ||	  Small but to the point  These dragon fly earrings are very small and cute. They're so light that I'm afraid I'm going to bend them every time I touch them, but I suspect they're a bit more hardy than they feel. Personally I'd prefer them to be just a little bit bigger but they're nice. <end>  Beautiful  I bought this as a Christmas present for someone and when I received it I almost couldn't part with it. It is simply beautiful and shipped quickly. The person it was for fell in love with it and the matching pendant immediately! <end>  sterling silver dragonfly earrings  I ordered this item a Christmas present for a close friend and she was really pleased with them when she opened them.I was really pleased with the quality of these earrings and would order from this company again. <end>  Pretty & Lightweight My New Favorite Earrings  Pretty, yet lightweight that you might forget you are wearing earrings.These earrings are sterling silver filigree and look nice enough for dress or casual with jeans and are just the right size for everyday wear.My only wish is that these earrings came in two lengths, the one you see here for everyday use and a longer more dangly style for evening wear  ) <end>  Dragonfly earrings win approval  When I purchased these Sterling Silver Filigree Dragonfly Hook Earrings, I should have bought more than one pair. I have had so many women ask where these were bought. They are very pretty and quite detailed. <end>  Nice craftsmanship  Although the earrings are a bit bigger than I had anticipated, I still enjoy wearing them. The craftsmanship is beautiful. <end>  Silver dragonfly ear rings  Beautiful. They are just like the ones I use to get at the Renaissance Festivals. <end>  nice earrings  i recently bought these for my stepdaughter. i was very pleased with the purchase. they are sturdy and not flimsy at all, yet lightweight. My stepdaughter loves them! they were a little larger than i had pictured, but they look great in her ears. shipping was quick and the rest of the order was great too. expect quality items from this vendor. <end>
 B0002Z7NHQ  Rosycroix Silver-Tone Pewter Gothic Druid Immortality Rose Pendant Necklace ||	  Beautiful but not as described  The pendant is gorgeous, but the chain is a cheap non - silver necklace, so drop it and just take the pendant.N. <end>  Beautiful  I think the necklace is beautiful, it's exactly what I expected. I really love it!! <end>  I have had this necklace for 3 years!  I have had this necklace for 3 years and it is still in perfect condition. It looks just as nice as it did when I first purchased it. None of the red has come off, it doesn't bend easily, and it has retained its shine. This is one of my favorite pieces of jewelry so I wear it a lot. <end>  My daughter's Lucky Charm  My daughter loves this and wears it all the time. She has gotten a lot of compliments. Only problem is the little thing that holds the pendent to the chain is weak that is why it has 4 stars not 5. My daughter considers it her lucky charm. <end>  very nice  this item looks all most exactly like in the pictures very pleased shipping was ver fast had the item 3 days after order with choosing stranded shipping worth the $$ any time <end>  hmmmm........  i bought this necklace a week ago and it just reached todaythe pendant is very cutei was slightly disappointed since it looked way better in the picture (the red color on da roses are pretty light compared to the picture. u can barely see it)the gift box is smaller than i expectedthe quality of the chain is very cheapall in all it isn't that bad but i suggest that people should prepare a back up chain for the pendant <end>  Holiday Gift  I purchased this as a holiday gift for a friend's girlfriend. I thought it would be like the seller's picture. It was close, but sadly not quite as nice looking. I found myself kind of embarassed to give it to her and if I had more time I would not have. Silver Insanity is always a delight to work with, they ship quickly and you are never left guessing when your product will arrive. However this product just was not what I expected.  -( <end>  Was Decent  Bought this for my mom once, and to be honest she didn't seem to liek it. It was made pretty cheaply as well. But it did come in a cool little box. <end>  good and bad  I bought this for my girl back home.she was very happy to recieve it,called it pretyy and said that she simply loved it.she wore it one day and the chain broke.I am very upset.I hate having to buy extra things just to fix the item I originally bought to try to make it better.I should come brand new and well made.lets face it who like to buy faulty items.On the upside the rose was very beautiful she said.so unless you wanna buy an extra more expensive chain do not wast your time. <end>  Great  This is a great necklace! I constantly get positive remarks on it everywhere I go! The only problem is that the chain broke after a few days, but it was a very easy fix thanks to a pair of players... I recommend this product <end>  cool  Silver Insanity does it again, bringing high quality, unique jewellery to the masses at affordable prices. This necklace is so gorgeous one has to see it up close to fully appreciate it. It is so detailed, even the tiny thorns are so delicate and perfectly placed. This is such a beautiful piece of jewellery that no woman should be without. This Valentine's Day (or anniversary or birthday) instead of buying your woman chocolates that she doesn't need or flowers that will die after a few days, buy her a gorgeous, unique rose that will last forever! <end>  Receive as a gift, VERY disappointed  I had this item on my wish list for a couple years and finally got it this Christmas from my Brother in Law. I was SO disappointed! It looks like it was made in the dark or by a 2 year old. The red on the roses was uneven and missing at the top of the large rose. It just looks really bad! The pewter is fine, no issues with that and as most necklaces, the chain is crap. I am sad that whoever made this didn't care how it was going to look. <end>  beautiful  I loved this product. The chain wasn't that great but I had plenty of others. The charm itself was exactly what i was looking for and I get questions about it all the time. I work in an upscale restaurant and my guests are always shocked at first glance but love it once they get to look at it. I would definitely recommend this product. <end>  Got it Dec 23, 2011  Such a beautiful piece of jewelry, the box that came with it was a nice touch to it. The picture of the item does not do it justice. It arrived on the earliest estimated delivered date. Would defentaly continue to buy from Silver Insanity. <end>  Charming.  The necklace is pretty, but the chain and link to the chain are a bit low quality. <end>  Nice but not spectacular  I'm glad that I had the customer images as a baseline, because it did not look much like their advertising image. If you want to know what it looks like, check out the customer images before buying. In addition, the chain (which I don't like much anyway) has two kinks in it, and it was threaded backwards (for a lefty not a righty, and righty is standard).Update 8/27/11  As it turns out, this has become one of my favorite pieces. The chain is still kinked but I've gotten used to putting it on backwards. <end>  Rosycroix silver tone necklace  This necklace is offered at a great price. It combines the beauty of the rose and the spirit of the cross in a pewter finish. You will get many compliments on this pendant because it is so unique. The shipping was very reasonable; the jewelry gift box that it came in is as pretty as the necklace. This is a true keepsake! <end>  i love it.  i love it. i haven't taken it off since i got it out of the mail. <end>  EXCELLENT!!  the picture doesnt do the pendant justice.. its simply beautiful.. my g/f loved it.. infact she wears it everywhere.. its a nice change from the constant hearts and beads and what not that stores only carry.. if your looking for a necklace that will stand out and looks great detail wise this is a wise choice.. its not to dark as the description makes it sounds.. and it comes in a neat little box that has a "spell on the inside".. great gift idea fellow guys who are wondering about buying... <end>  amazing necklace  I got this for a present for my wife. This is a really pretty necklace. Very good quality and reasonably priced also. My wife really loves it and I am thinking of getting another one for myself. <end>  The Most Beautiful Rose Necklace Ever!!!  Silver Insanity does it again, bringing high quality, unique jewellery to the masses at affordable prices. This necklace is so gorgeous one has to see it up close to fully appreciate it. It is so detailed, even the tiny thorns are so delicate and perfectly placed. This is such a beautiful piece of jewellery that no woman should be without. This Valentine's Day (or anniversary or birthday) instead of buying your woman chocolates that she doesn't need or flowers that will die after a few days, buy her a gorgeous, unique rose that will last forever! <end>  happy gifting for teen  our teen niece seems to love this necklace, she's really into 'goth' look, and she wears this everywhere. so good buy. <end>  Wife loves it...  ...which means of course, I do as well. Really pretty piece. Well made and of apparent high quality. Silver insanity has some really unique pieces. I suspect I will be sent here again. Birthday's coming up, doncha know? <end>  Beautiful necklace  I love this necklace. It's beautiful and works with casual or dress clothing. It's a good accent to any outfit or can act as the center of attention. I've had lots of compliments about it and wear it often. <end>  Not very impressive Not like the pic  I thought this would be much bigger and better made. To be honest, it kind of looks like it came out of a gumball machine. I would give this to a little kid, but never an adult. I kept it, but it is expensive for what you get. Looks cheap and not as nice as I had hoped. <end>  Alluring  I was expecting this necklace with high hopes, and they were definitely not disappointed!It was just the right size and the cord was just the right length. It had this gothic, otherworldly feel about it, and it was simply beautiful. Just, extraordinary.Plus it came in this small black box with the picture of a dragon and a moon in the front - extra brownie points. 5/5 stars, overall. <end>  Decent Pendant, But cheap chain  The Pendant is very nice and good looking, But the chain it comes with is very cheaply made. I bought this for my Girlfriend and the first time she put it on she almost broke the clasp on the chain. If you buy this necklace then I would suggest that you get a better chain to go with it. <end>  Beautiful Pendant  I am very pleased with the pendant. The chain it came on is really crappy. However I wasn't purchasing the chain. Be prepared to buy a new chain for the rosycroix. Silver Insanity was fantastic with shipping and customer service, 5 stars to them!! I am purchasing a silver chain from them to go with my new rosycroix. <end>  Very Large, Looks Like a Crucifix, The Red is Poorly Done  Very large, looks like a crucifix, the red is poorly done and the chain is crap. I wasted $20. There's not much to write, it's junk. <end>  Cool Necklace  I ordered this the week before Christmas. they shipped the next day and arrived in time without paying the extra recommended shipping. The box is cool, the necklace is well detailed the only negative is the red enamel. either a better job applying the red or just leave it off all together it really doesn't need it anyways. Good for an inexpensive gift. <end>  Rose Necklace  This necklace arrived very quickly in good condition. I do not have problem with the chain as other customers had mentioned. Mine seems sturdy and i think it goes well with the pendant. The only issue I have it that the gel stuff they use to give it the red color... it's as if my necklace was filled just a bit too much. I would have liked it to have a little less red so I can see more of the silver beneath it. But other than that, it is beautiful, and has great detail, and receives a lot of compliments. <end>  Gorgeous  Very detailed a very beautiful piece. My daughter is thrilled with the necklace. Another really unusual piece that is so worth having. <end>  as always  what can I say, again the design is gorgeous and the craftsmanship is top notch. When I order from silver insanity I get excited because I know I will get the best of the best. Beautiful and sturdy. If you don't own it get it!!!!!!!! <end>  Beautiful piece of jewelry!  Fabulous and unique necklace! I love it and wear it all the time. As most of the other reviews stated, the chain is awful but I threw it away and kept the pendant. I put the pendant on a black silk cord and it is stunning. <end>  It broke!  This necklace broke imediately! It came with a chain I didnt wanted so I tried to unhook the pendant from the chain and then the "ring" which was attached to the pendant broke! So now I have to forget about it or pay even more money and wait longer for it to be fixed at a smith! Very bad!Otherwise beautiful piece. <end>
 B0002Z7NIA  Sun with Moon and Star Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  very attractive  These earrings are so exceptionally shiny and cute. The are a nice size and look very well made. A couple of small drawbacks  The pointy edges of the sunshine's rays are kind of sharp and also, the hook part seems to be extra thin because a normal small rubber back does not fit and will slide right off but if you wear the earrings without a rubber back, they will slide out and you will lose them (I know this because I had to backtrack in the grocery store only to find my missing earring in the produce section!). They DO provide a rubber back that fits but it is so very very tiny that I could easily lose it and it's hard to handle with fingernails. BUT don't let those things stop you from buying these earrings because they are so distinctive and attractive. I always get lots of compliments when I wear them. <end>  cheap  I was dissapointed with these earrings. They look and feel cheap (which they were!) I was hoping for better quality as I read the reviews before purchasing them. I never wear them because they are so thin and cheap looking <end>  sun and moon earings  these earings make a wonderful statement. If anyone knows where I can purchase them, please let me know. I lost the moon earing...I purchased my original pair at Macys <end>  Love these earrings  I had these same earrings years ago..When I found them again I was so excited! Also the price was Great!! <end>  Great earrings.  Thanks these earrings are just what I was looking for and can highly recommend them. <end>  Beautiful earrings...  I just received these earrings today and I love them. They aren't overly big or showy but are very pretty and different from any other earrings that I own. They don't come with rubber backs but the backs I already have fit fine, though the hooks are thin like the other reviewer mentioned.I am very happy with these earrings and I will definitely order from Silver Insanity again. <end>
 B0002Z7ZII  Sterling Silver and Yellow & Green Amber Pendant ||	  Amber Pendant  Nice size. My wife was very happy to receive this item as a gift. The only downside was the sterling silver appeared a bit tarnished / dull to when delivered. <end>
 B0002Z85DC  Freshwater Cultured Pearl Bracelet w/ Adjustable Pink Leather Band, 7-8" ||	  Elegant, pretty, adaptable  This bracelet overall is pretty and elegant enough to wear with an evening dress, yet the leather and silver allow it to work with denim (even your most faded jeans), and the classicism of the pearls make it look great with a dress or a suit. It's a lovely combination of tough and classy. Everyone who's seen it loves it, and the pink seems to go with everyones' skin tones. Pink and olive skin doen't always go together, but this particular pink makes olive skin look delicately peach-toned. I'm so glad I took a chance with this unusual design! <end>
 B0002Z85E6  14k White Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl 7.0-7.5mm Necklace, 18" and Bracelet, 7" Set ||	  Beautiful, lovely, but would like a different clasp  The set is absolutely gorgeous in person, and I'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster. The clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design, and it's incredibly secure when fastened; however, it's difficult to maneuver and I can't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on - or get it off - without assistance. That's the only reason I wouldn't give this five stars - the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great. <end>  beautiful!  Very beautiful pearls. There are visible blemishes, which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed. The uniformity is very good. All pearls are more or less same size. Beautiful clasps too. However I have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help, especially the bracelet. Took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist. The color is slightly yellowish. The shape is good  kinda semiround rather than potato. They'll make great gifts. <end>  a christmas present  my wife was surely surprised when she rec'd this gift now that she is in a retail lsdies shop. To dress up and add pearls looks fantastic. thanks well worth the price. <end>  Got these as a gift for my daughter  I was surprised at the quality. The bracelet and necklace matched perfectly. It was a great gift for my 23-year old daughter. She loved them. <end>  Could have been nice...  I understood the necklace and bracelet to be a matched set. When the pearls arrived the necklace was a different color and grade than the bracelet. It was really too bad because the bracelet was really rather nice looking. The neklace however was some kind of peach color and so full of flaws, Yeach... <end>
 B0002ZG12Y  Pugster Sandle Red Dangle Italian Charms ||	  Nice Charm, Weak Link  I loved this little sandal charm! It was dangling nicely on my Italian charm bracelet, until one day, I looked down, and it was gone! Apparently, it got hung up on my clothing, and it broke the gold looking chain. I felt blessed to find it again, So I know that it was the round bead at the end of the chain that broke off. Funny thing, is that I did not know when it broke, I just looked down & found that it was gone. I must find a better way to hold the charm on the bracelet. Know that it's cute, but I'm giving it 4 stars because the chain broke, and I almost lost it. <end>

 B000300YTY  Mens Sterling Silver Gothic Wrapping SNAKE Ring Size 7(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Good looking, but horribly fragile  I ordered this ring about three and a half months ago, and after wearing it nearly everyday, it recently broke literally in half (so now I have to "C" shaped pieces). I was taking it off, it fell on a hard surface from about two feet and cracked on the weld located directly opposite the snake "head" part. I was never excessively rough with the ring, so it had to be craftsmanship. Also noticed was that the silver plating had begun to come off rather quickly around the edges of the ring, and it turned black. The plating wearing off wasn't too bad looking but I was rather dissapionted when it broke in half in a situation were most rings would leave unscathed. I am giving it a two because it looks good and feels heavy, but is simply made to a standard not fit for everyday use. I would only recommend it to people looking to use it casually, once or twice a week. Otherwise, it will break, it is not a ring to wear everyday. <end>

 B000300YWG  Sterling Silver Wire and Chain Mens Band Ring Size 11.5(Size 7,8,8.5,10,12) ||	  Great ring...  I like this ring very much, it is actually the first ring I have ever purchased for myself, and fits my appearance well(Im, kind of a rocker guy). The only negative things about the ring is that it can damage some things due to the deep ridges. Also, do not wear the ring if you are using a bar of soap, because it will literally dig chunks out of the soap, and get stuck in the ring. It is easy to wash out, but reaps hell on your soap supply, haha. However, I feel that this was a great purchase, and I actually feel "naked" when I take the ring off. It almost feels like it's meant to be on my hand at this point. Which I've only worn for a little over a month. Also, if your fingers are very close together, I would not reccomend this ring, I have boney more spaced out fingers. However, if you do not have a boney more thin spaced out fingered hand. You are most likely going to have sores on your surrounding fingers from the width of the ring, unless you put the ring on your thumb. I even had a sore in the webbing of my fingers. However, I like the ring so much I left it on and the sore went away....P.S. The ring also seems to protect my hand. If I make a fist or touch something with the outside of the hand. The ring always seems to make first contact. <end>  Loving Ring  I bought this product as a second ring to wear when I was dressed casually. After I recieved the ring it has become my number one choice to wear. It is comfortable and actually has a classy look to it.I wear this ring all the time and get many compliments on it. When I ordered this ring I never thought I would love it as much as I do. This ring was a great find. <end>  Nice Ring  I love this ring. I purchased it from Amazon about a year ago and I wear it everyday. I get many compliments about the ring. I would recommend this ring to anywho who is into silver. <end>  christmas  the ring is sturdy, and heavy, worth the price, came quickly, my husband loved it. he wears it all the time., <end>

I didn't realize how small it was until i got but i love it! Its small enough that you can still tell what it is but not large enough to weight your neck down! Its also great quality the chain is really great! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a durable nice looking necklace. <end>
 B00030DBQM  Solid Sterling Silver 8mm Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Good product  The items from this site are beautiful and fairly priced. Shipping is quite fast. Thank you! <end>  Buyer Beware  I bought this ring to use as a junker substitute wedding band when out in the woods/backpacking/etc. To be quite honest, the price is right here for a nearly disposable ring. It really is dirt cheap. But, you get what you pay for. As I wore the ring today to get a feel for it, I noticed the seam where it was sized as the solder showed up as a distinct dark strip with a large pool at one end of the seam. It is insignificant due the role this ring plays for me, but you should be forewarned that the quality, at least in my case, is directly proportional to the price. If you're looking for something nice that you will wear on a regular basis, you may want to spend a little more money, but if you want a beater to take damage you would rather not inflict on the wedding band you invested in, this is perfect.&lt;edit> Well, to seal the deal, it turned my finger blue over night due to the sloppy solder job. <end>

 B00030DCFC  Sterling Silver Pentacle or Pentagram Hook Earrings ||	  Pretty Earrings  I bought these earrings more than a year ago and they have held up very well. They are dainty and just the right size in my opinion. They look great and I can wear them all the time. <end>  very pretty  These earrings are very pretty and perfect size. I really love them, and wear constantly. <end>  Nicely Made, but Small  These earrings are very well made, but they're only 11mm wide, not 1/2" as stated in the description. That doesn't sound like much, but it would have made a difference. I wouldn't mind paying a couple more bucks for a bigger earring. I do like them, though. <end>

 B00030FHXC  2mm Sterling Silver Antiqued Popcorn Chain Necklace(Lengths 14",16",18",20",24",30") ||	  love the texture  I love the texture to this item but remember that 2mm is very small. I really wanted something a bit bigger but that is my fault, not the company's. <end>  great item, I'm wearing it now  Hi, these bracelets are great purchases. I have two of them now. they are long lasting and very comfortable. <end>  Silver Antiqued Popcorn Chain Necklace  I had ordered from Silver Insanity in the past and was pleased with the overall quality, attention to detail, fast shipping and reasonable price. this time was no exception the chain is well made and has an antique look, I bought the 16' choker and was not disappointed with the attention to detail. I'm a very satisfied customer and will continue to order from Silver Insanity. <end>  a great pendent chain  I got this chain for a pendent i was giving as a gift, the necklace that came with the pendent was a simple rope that didn't really seem right with it, this is an excellent chain and a great price.One thing, i didn't take into account how short 20 inches would be, not a problem as it is a gift for a younger sister, but something to be aware of. <end>  Antiqued Popcorn Chain  Looks like black gold. Lovely necklace to wear alone or with a trinket. I love it.. <end>  Recommended  Stunning and sturdy. I needed a chain for my larger pendants, and this one is perfect. <end>  Well made; great for male or female  I was looking for a chain that would match a pewter medal with a small bale for my boyfriend. This was so perfect, I ordered a second one for myself. Good value. <end>  thank you  very good quality, good in use, nice color. perfect, recommending to everybody. i love it.thank you very much for it. <end>  Good buy  This goes great with the sun pendent I purchased. They set each other off in a complimentry and looks good for every day wear. <end>  Little disappointed in the beginning  This one ended up turning out a lot thinner than I expected. After another disappointment with a different seller I had to use this chain. Not only has it proved to be 100% silver, but it is also sturdy and very resistant. I've been wearing for months with a very heavy piece of silver hanging from it and it has proven to have been the best choice I've made in months. <end>  Beautiful  This necklace is much better than I expected. It is great quality, strong, and looks great too with all my charms! <end>  Great quality chain  I wasn't expecting much with the price of this chain, but was really pleasantly surprised! It's as good or better quality than other sterling silver chains I've purchased for much more. Will definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  good chain , but please order your size  well i this chain is a nice one and was shipped very fast, so will buy for the seller again,its is nice to put amulets on because thats what i got it for, it looks nice and brings out my amulet, jus please order the correct size, i ordered a 16'' and it seemed preety small, but its a good size if u dont want a rope around your neck, nice chain once again <end>  nice necklace  I bought this to hang the anchor from that I also bought from Amazon. It was too small for my husband so I kept it and got him another one. <end>  Beautiful strong chain  this silver chain was an excellent buy. Smaller around than I expected but well worth what I paid for it. <end>  Antiqued Popcorn Chain  This chain with it's antique finish is the perfect companion for some of my pendants. <end>  Cool little necklace  This necklace is delicate yet durable. I used it with larger and smaller pendants and it works great. <end>  Very good chain  Even though it is not quite what we expected (we thought it would be thicker - very difficult to judge from a picture)it is actually quite nice. It complements the silver dragon pendant that it was bought for, and, on second thought, it is actually better than a thicker chain would have been. A larger chain would have taken away from the actual pendant, and this is very like it in colour, so it blends well. My son is pleased with it, and happy that he can again wear his dragon pendant since he was born in the year of the dragon. <end>  Simple Chain  This chain has a very nice design that drew me to it from the moment I saw it. I enjoy the way it looks and feels when paired with the silver pendant I have for it. <end>  Silver chain that matches with lots of pendants  I was looking for some necklace to match with some pendants that I have. This is perfect. Sure that I could have found one better than this, but not with this price! <end>  junk  Sent back same day I received it. Broke right off my neck. made in China crap like everything made in China. Buy USA!!!!!!!!!!!! <end>  The silver cross was exactly what I wanted..But chain is too short  The silver cross was exactly what I wanted..But chain is too shortto get over your head.. The clasps on the chain are too small to keep undoing and clasping.. The slide on and off of about a 28" to 30" chain should suffice..for the average head.. You might add that with the sale of the crosses..and other pendants.. Don FL <end>  Short lived  A nice looking chain but too thin. Chain kinked and broke within 3 months. Nornal wear and tear of an active man was too much for this chain. Should be bought for a woman. <end>  Picture Does Not Do This Justice  I was looking for a chain to wear with a marcasite pendant someone gave me. I had been shopping around for quite some time searching for the "antique" look in a chain and came across this. I was hesitant to order it based upon the picture, but I took the chance and was very pleased. It was perfect. <end>  Lasted 8 wears  Chain had a nice weight/feel to it. But (as other reviews state) it lasted about 8 wears. Then snapped. Used it with a small light pendant. But as I took it off, I looked at it and it appeared to have a hole in it. I went to look at the hole/chain closer, and it just snapped in two. Not at the clasp or ring... the chain itself. Only wore it to hang out, so nothing extremely active or anything going on. Waste <end>  Great necklace!  I purchased the 20" variety of this necklace, and it is great. When a charm is placed on the necklace, since it is a popcorn chain, the charm easily slides around it. When placed on a desk, it easily piles and doesn't get tangled or twisted. The small end of the clip is ~2mm in size, allowing a charm to easily slip on.I have been wearing it nonstop for the past week, and it is a great necklace that I would buy again if I needed to, but it feels pretty strong so I might not need to for quite some time. <end>  flimsy clasp  The chain is nice enough, but I only got it around the first of December and already the little ring that attaches the chain to the clasp has fallen off and I almost lost the chain AND the pendant I had on it. I would have expected the chain to last longer than 2 months! <end>  Didn't last long...  Loved this chain when I received it but the lobster claw clasp broke in my hand after only two months of daily wear. Great looking chain but not too sturdy. <end>  This is a very  nice neck chain for the price. I bought a longer length and love the dark color so my husband can hide it (and his cross) under his shirt at work. He never has to take it off. It doesn't show any sign of wear and someone at the beach yesterday asked where he got the chain. Don't expect a big chunky chain. If you are looking for something flashy, this isn't the one for you. This piece is thinner and lays perfectly next to an open collar shirt or under a t-shirt without irritating his skin.The quality of the silver cord is good and sturdy so I don't worry about him catching it on something and having it break.I'm very satisfied and he loves it! <end>  thinner than you think but very nice  This is a very nice looking chain, just be aware that it is more delicate than the enlarged picture. Still a great value and a nicely made chain. <end>  Looks good with marcasite - too bad not a little thicker  This chain looks good with any marcasite or oxidized pendant. No problem fitting the end through the bale of any pendant. It's definitely thicker than the starter chain that comes with pendants. I do wish this chain were a little thicker (2 1/2 -3 mm?) I have a marcasite enhancer that is a 1" square and it looks a little thin for it, but the dark tone of the chain does go well with the marcasite. I think the picture of the chain on the web site is a pretty accurate representation of the color - a medium gray. Hope this will be a nice, strong chain for my pendants.The lobster claw clasp did break after a few wearings as some of the other reviewers reported. We replaced the clasp and the chain is now wearable and is fine. Clasp should not have broken but at least I have a wearable oxidized chain. <end>  Love It!  I purchased 2 of these chains. I just love them. They are very attractive and have never pulled or got tangled in my hair. They are perfect with my pendants to give them an antique look. Also they are very well made so I don't have to worry about them breaking. I'm very happy with them and if you want a nice sturdy, attractive chain that doesn't pull your hair, this is it. <end>  Perfect for a pendeant  This is the fourth one of these i have purchaed. I have a pendant that i constantly wear, i am prone to snagging it on things, but short of the abuse that i put these through, they are well designed, dont pull the hair out of my chest, and are designed where the clasp is small enough to put a pendant through, a quality that i have had trouble finding. <end>  FOR A GIFT TO A LIL GIRL IT WORKS  FOR A GIFT TO A LIL GIRL IT WORKS. ITS NOT MADE TO SUSTAIN THE WEAR BY THE DAY IN DAY OUT DUTIES AS A WORKING MAN NOR WORKING WOMAN. I KELP IT TO GIVE TO A LIL GIRL FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE WILL LOVE IT. DID RECIEVE PRODUCT IN REALLY GOOD TIME. GOOD DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU. <end>  you just have to 'see' jewelry before you buy it...  this is an ok chain. it's good weight for the price but it just doesn't look spectacular. also, it catches on and pulls my wife's hair so she can only wear it when she has hair in a ponytail. it's just one of those cases where the picture is considerably better than the real deal. <end>  Looks great and very well made!  The 2mm Sterling Silver Antiqued Popcorn Chain Necklace 24" looks great and very well made! I like it very much! <end>  Very nice necklace...  I bought a popcorn necklace as well from this seller. The necklace was shorter, because I didn't realise the option to select length was one click away. But I prefer it shorter.The expedited international shipment length is not true. I got the package in 14 days or so, in Romania. The seller is nice though... Did combine packages also...And, also did refund part of my shipment, the shipment of this necklace, because my package didn't arrive in due time...It's more gentle, this way, shorter... Though, I guess that this type of necklace is nicer when it is a bit longer, I'm not sure...Mine it is the minimum length on the website...I do hope it will last long. Reading the comments here, some wrote it didn't always last too long. And I'm quite worried...Though, I do really enjoy it... <end>  Perfect little antiqued chain  The chain was perfect for what I was looking for. I wanted a chain that looked antique to go with an antique pendant. I also needed a 14 inch chain as I have a rather slight neck and it seemed impossible to find until I found this! <end>  Lovely Anitqued Popcorn Chain Necklace  I wore this chain with a Marcasite pendant and recevied many compliments! I bought the 30" and it's perfect to wear out on formal occasions as well as casual depending on how you dress it up or down. <end>  nice chains  I got 3 chains, 2 gifts & one for myself. Loved the color and thickness of them. I use them for Pandora type beads and they are great and casual. The only drawback is that they grab bits of yarn from my sweaters. I still love them. <end>  Great chain for price and practice  Good chain. popcorn style is great alternative to traditional chain links. had one break on me when I pulled a shirt off and it got caught. not the strongest build but fairly durable and good looking. Recommended. <end>  Great Chain  The chain is sturdy and pretty. I purchased it to use with a pendant I bought in Mexico. I am very happy with the product. <end>  love it  My boyfriend got me this when he got some electronics for him self about a week ago. When I got it I was very happy to find that it was exactly what i had been hoping for, the only thing that confused me was when i got it was 20 min after i had checked that delivery stats that said it had not even been shipped yet. This is not really a bad thing just confusing. But the product over all it wonderful looks amazing and is something different than what most expect to see. <end>  it's ok  My wife bought this chain. The chain is just ok. It's not as heavy and more 'fragile looking' than she would like. She says she'll wear it but, intends to keep looking for another. The clasp is tiny, she wishes it were larger so it would be easier to open and close. <end>  Perfect for the 1 3/4 inch Celtic cross I purchased  I had a hard time deciding on this chain because I didn't know how thick 2 mm would be and a lot of reviews referred to it as too thin and not weighty enough. I disagree. The thickness was perfect for the cross I purchased for my husband. I also liked that it was an antiqued color as I didn't want a shiny sterling for a Celtic cross. Additionally, other reviews referred to the chain as being fragile. We wouldn't describe it that way at all. It looks WAY more expensive than it is. <end>  I like it enough to buy another  I originally purchased this item in August of 2008. I used it to hold my wedding ring as I was unable to wear it on my finger. This chain worked perfectly I wore it every day for the last 2 1/2 years.Just today the chain broke right next to the clasp. The clasp did not break but the chain itself did. I was most likely the cause of the breakage. I always take it off and twirl it around my fingers having it whiz through the air. I probably end up doing this several times a week at least. I am surprised it has withstood my abusing it for so long.When it broke I immediately got on amazon and looked up my past order to get the exact same chain as a replacement. In fact I ordered the new chain, then showed my wife the broken chain.This is a good chain. As long as they have them I will use this to hold my wedding ring everyday. <end>  Excellent but tiny!  I picked up the 20 inch model but reconsidering, I might have gone with the 24 inch instead. Additionally the chain is very thin; when they say 2mm, you better believe it. Over all a great product though. <end>  Beautiful  I love this chain I was a little concerned over purchasing this chain I was not sure about it. I was afraid with it being antiqued a dark chain it would look cheap,but I love it I am glad I went ahead and bought it, it does not look like an old tarnished chain like I was afraid it would, it is unique the chain goes so well with a certain pendant that I have it works perfectly with it. So all I can say about the Antiqued Popcorn Chain is you will not go wrong in ordering it, it is a very nice chain. I ordered the 20" and it hangs perfect I wanted it to hang low on my chest and it is just right. <end>  PERFECT for Antiqued Silver Pendants  I was seeking the perfect chain for sterling silver pendants that were antiqued. I'm an "earth mother" type, and I have several pendants that just didn't work on the silver chains I already had. I came across this antiqued popcorn chain by accident while looking for another 18" chain, and was thrilled. I was even MORE thrilled when it arrived, and I slipped my pendant on it. Seriously perfect! I will be ordering another 18" chain, plus a 20" and 24". I also love the fact that this chain doesn't catch the hair at the back of my neck. <end>  Just as Promised  One reviewer stated that this chain wasn't as dark as shown so I was hoping they were correct. Unfortunately, it was just as dark as the picture. I prefer lighter chains but liked the design of this one. The seller shipped it promptly, it came in a little velor pouch. Good quality. It's not a light chain nor a heavy chain. It will withstand wearing all the time but is really antiqued, looks exactly like the picture. <end>  Is just like advertised.  I ordered this and the 5mm bracelet. I would love it if they made the necklace in a 5mm as this one did not match the bracelet. I will probably give it as a gift rather than return it. <end>  My fault. Still really great though  )  I love this chain! It's a great, different look for me, and also for those who buy it. Only problem was... well, I ordered the wrong size. 16" is my neck size, so I guess that's what I was thinking when I ordered it. Oh well, it's still great though. I guess I'll let my little cousin have it, as he could have no trouble fitting it. <end>  This chain is GREAT!  I'm so happy with this chain; I had a pendant that came with a short chain, so I needed a longer one. The length wouldn't be a problem to find...it was the color that would be my quest. The pendant is an amethyst stone is surrounded by marcasite and dark silver. Bright silver wouldn't be right. So I went looking here on Amazon, and found this chain. My daughter said she didn't think it would look good....man! was SHE wrong! The chain appears darker in their photo than in real life. It is PERFECT with the pendant! See my user photo, shows truer color AND shows what 2mm looks like next to a dime. It's a great chain, at a great price. Oh, and get this  I ordered it Sunday night, got an email Monday morning that it had shipped, and received it Wednesday afternoon! EXCELLENT. Don't hesitate...buy it! <end>  For the price....  ...you just can't beat this chain. It's slightly unsual and goes very well with some of my silver pendants. It's not really shiny silver it's more muted and darker but very nice. In fact that's why I liked this chain so much. It doesn't compete with the pendant but matches a certain style of pendant perfectly. I have a green man pendant that it looks like it was made for. It's not too terribly thick and comfortable to wear. <end>  Great Chain for a Great Price  This chain is a great deal! I bought it for a pendant I already had, and love it, it is very antique looking and also doesn't snag the hair, which is very important! <end>  Clasp Broken  I recently purchased this item as a gift for Christmas. When I received the chain the clasp was broken. I e-mailed this company two times regarding their return policy. I have yet to hear back from the company. I am VERY disappointed in my purchase AND this particular company. <end>  Broken Clasp  The chain looked great when I received it. However, the problem I had is the Lobster Claw Clasp broke after a couple of weeks wearing it. I would not recommend this chain for someone wanting it for everyday wear. <end>  popped chain  I purchased this chain last year, I had worn it only twice and then it just fell off my neck. I was so disappointed.  ( It broke in two pieces.It was my favorite chain, I wont buy this style again. <end>  Didn't get the order at all nor the explanations  I didn't get my order at all and neither the company provided any explanations as to what had happened. <end>  Not what I expected  This chain is nice enough, but very thin and flimsy. The detail is not as prominent as the description and picture indicates. The chain is weak and would not hold up to addition of any "charms" as I had expected to use it for. From even three feet away, it appears like a bit of hardware store cord, not jewelry. <end>  Nice chain  This is a nice chain to go with my marcasite pendant. It deserves a 3.5 for its price and appearance. I got the 16 inch which works perfectly. However, the chain thickness is a little small. I would've preferred a 3-4 mm chain and that was my fault. I was so excited about the reviews that I overlooked its thickness is 2 mm. Buying the correct length of chain is key. If your neck size is 17", the absolute shortest length you should buy is a 20" chain. <end>  Best chain ever  This chain is *beautiful*, looking to me like a tiny slinky snake, and the darker color is fabulous! I've had trouble finding a darker silver chain that is also nickel-free, so this is a great find. Now I want to buy it in all the lengths! Very fast shipping from the seller/USPS too. <end>
 B000406HG2  Star of David Necklace from the Artazia Collection #063 JN ||	  Beautiful work - Good communication - no problems  Very happy with all products that I purchased from this seller. Also purchased silver Chai's that were perfect gifts for my children. This Star of David necklace was beautiful. If it hadn't been a gift, I would have gladly kept it for myself. <end>  beautiful and different  i have had this pendant for a while now and am very happy with it. very different and unique, get lots of compliments on it. delivery and packaging were very good. price was great too. <end>  Original item  The star looks lovely, most certainly out of the ordinary. Unfortunately I am a little alergic to the chain, silver would have been better. <end>  Beautiful gift  This was purchased as a gift for a teenage girl. The pendant was absolutely beautiful. I was proud to give it as a gift and would not hesitate to purchase again from Artazia. <end>
 B0004HAUX6  Cross Pendant with 18 inch necklace 14K Yellow Gold 38X26mm ||	  Beautiful  This is a beautiful cross pendant. I receive many compliments on it. I combined this with a Patron Saint Medal and felt the chain was a little thin for the added weight. So I did end up changing the chain to something more durable. I have had this cross pendant for a year now and am very pleased with it. If you are wondering about the back of this pendant, it is smooth. The pattern doesn't repeat itself to the back and the cross is not hollow. The pendant is also light in weight. It is a little larger than I prefer, but it is a lovely pendant. I am very pleased with it. <end>
 B0004HC32W  Cross Pendant with 18 inch necklace 14K White Gold 22X16mm ||	  great  I am very pleased w/ the quality of the cross, but the chain was a little small. <end>
 B0004HCKDY  Cross Pendant with 18 inch necklace 14K White Gold 16.5X12mm ||	  Worth the money  It's a little small, but this necklace is beautiful. I love it. I think it was worth the money. <end>
 B0004K4BO2  Star of David Judaic Earrings from the Artazia Collection #275 JE ||	  Nice size  I've bought similiar earrings before & they always seemed a little too small These are a nice size & colors are lovely <end>
 B0004K4BR4  Cat Earrings from the Artazia Collection #333 NE ||	  Beautiful and nicely crafted  These were a little spendy but are very cute for my 8 year old who is very allergic to nickel. These stainless earrings are her favorite and they don't bother her ears.Thanks Artazia! <end>  Uniquely pretty. Now about the packaging...  These earrings appeared well made and delightfully detailed. My wife receives many comments and compliments about them. So why not a fifth star? The box they arrived in made them look like a dollar store purchase. Though the box usually gets thrown away, these are worth a better initial presentation. A minor complaint really. Certainly worth the $$$.Consider buying the cat pin as well. You won't be disappointed! <end>  A xmas gift  it was good, she liked it. <end>
 B0004K4FCA  Star of David Judaic Earrings from the Artazia Collection #360 JE ||	  Lovely star of David earrings I found on Amazon!  These earrings were a gift for my daughter. It was very hard for me to tell just looking at the photos from Amazon online exactly what size they would be or the weight (I have learned over time not to trust descriptions too much), but they were very lovely and I knew she would like them. I was not disappointed. She loved them. The craftsmanship is excellent. The design is balanced, eyecatching, and while symbolic, not over the top. I would recommend this designer/craftsperson to anyone. It is an outstanding product. <end>
 B0004K4WFA  Peace Dove Necklace from the Artazia Collection #062 JN NN ||	  Chain needs an upgrade  I received this necklace last week for my birthday. It is gorgeous and so unique; definitely a piece of art. The only disappointing element was the chain that is basically cheap and could have come from any teen jewelry store from the mall. It's like hanging up Rembrandt with a thumbtack. I will get another chain, but in the meantime I'm concerned that the chain could break if I wore it now. <end>  Artazia Peace Dove necklace  Pretty dove pendant, maybe not quite as colorful as the photo but still very nice. Definitely a unique art-type item. Also store shipped quickly which was great. We will likely buy more from Artazia. <end>  Artazia Peace Dove Necklace  The Peace Dove itself is as beautiful as the picture. My wife has gotten many compliments on the piece. However, the first thing she did was replace the chain. <end>  Peace Dove Necklace  Beautiful piece, only thing I did purchase a stronger chain, as the first time i wore it, it fell off, YIKES, did not want to loose such a beautiful piece.Again I absolutely love their pieces, keep them coming. Thanks <end>
 B0004K5CD6  Bat Mitzvah Necklace with Hebrew "Bat Mitzvah" from the Artazia Collection #401 JN ||	  Bat Mitzvah Necklace  My grand daughter, as well as my daughter were delighted with this necklace. Beings as she now has so many Star of Davids to choose from, to wear, this is something different, and as Sarah say, special. The workmanship is very fine, and the only recommendation would be a better quality necklace part. The pendant is superb. <end>
 B00061FBKC  Sterling Silver Genuine Red Garnet Celtic Knot 7.25" Bracelet ||	  Looks even nicer than the picture  I put this on my wish list based on just the picture. When I opened up my Christmas present, I was very pleased. It is well made and looks even better than it did in the picture. <end>
 B00061FC74  Solid Sterling Silver 8mm Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Good product  The items from this site are beautiful and fairly priced. Shipping is quite fast. Thank you! <end>  Buyer Beware  I bought this ring to use as a junker substitute wedding band when out in the woods/backpacking/etc. To be quite honest, the price is right here for a nearly disposable ring. It really is dirt cheap. But, you get what you pay for. As I wore the ring today to get a feel for it, I noticed the seam where it was sized as the solder showed up as a distinct dark strip with a large pool at one end of the seam. It is insignificant due the role this ring plays for me, but you should be forewarned that the quality, at least in my case, is directly proportional to the price. If you're looking for something nice that you will wear on a regular basis, you may want to spend a little more money, but if you want a beater to take damage you would rather not inflict on the wedding band you invested in, this is perfect.&lt;edit> Well, to seal the deal, it turned my finger blue over night due to the sloppy solder job. <end>  Good product  The items from this site are beautiful and fairly priced.

 B00061OLEE  Yellow Jade Dangle Earrings ||	  Very Pretty  I have a yellow jade necklace with chips and was fortunate to find the right color and style match here on Amazon com.

 B00061RG00  Emerald Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Ring Sterling Silver Band Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  Beautiful Ring  I got this ring so that I would have something that would match a pair of earrings I had. This ring is perfect. It shines beautifully and I don't think anyone but a jeweler would be able to tell the difference at first glance. I love my ring. I think it's perfect. I think the sellers helped make the experience a lot better. By far one of the best sellers I've dealt with on Amazon thus far. Gorgeous gorgeous ring!! <end>  Just right.  I love this ring!! I have small fingers. (I wear a size 5 on my ring finger) I was worried that the stone would be too big and have that "fake" look. But that is not the case with this ring. It looks very real and I've had a lot of complements on it. And it hasn't turned my finger green like a lot of other silver rings do! I totally love it!! <end>  Awesome  This item unfortunatley did not fit but I loved the ring so much and the packaging I ordered myself another one and kept this on to give away! I WILL be purchasing from this vendor again and again <end>  This ring is awesome.  For $8, you can't get a prettier ring. I wear mine all the time. It's not perfect, but seriously, if you're looking for perfection with $8. . .I don't know what to tell you. I'm seriously considering buying the other shapes of solitaire rings that Gem Avenue has for sale. Awesome!! <end>  Awesome Product  I really love and appreciate their service and the product was incredible and i hope to always get my stuff from here. <end>  Misleading picture  I usually love rings from this company but be warned that this ring doesn't look anything like the picture. The ring I received had a super long rectangular stone, not a nice square as seen in the picture. Mine was also tarnished or looked like it had torch marks up the side. I will definitely be returning this ring. <end>  Beautiful!  You get exactly what you are looking at, no surprises...a beautiful sparkly ring. It arrived quickly in a pretty gift box, and my wife loved it - unfortunately I got the wrong size, so I am returning for the right size...and so far the return process is going smoothly! <end>  Perfect temp!  Ordered this as a temporary replacement for my actual engagement ring and to wear when I'm out hiking and doing other stuff where losing my ring would not be cool. It's perfect and the price is perfect. Most people don't even know that it's not the real thing. <end>  dammaged goods  the first time i got this ring which was last year i got one that was really good, but when i ordered this one this year (2009) I got it bent and it looked like the diamond was lop sided with the ring, i guess that's what you get for a cheap ring under $10Not buying from Gem Avenue again. <end>  not good enough  When I received this ring, I was not happy because its box looks very cheap. I was not stunned by the ring, it looks simple. But it doesn't really look fake at first glance. The stone though got loose. And the polishing is not good! <end>  Im from Brazil !!!!  My cousin that living in USA brought to me this ring and i love it very much !It is so brightness!!! <end>  Nice But Not What I Expected..But still very nice.  For the money that I paid for it, I was not disappointed. It's a very nice ring, but you can def see that it's not a real diamond, which is fine by me. I was hoping it looked a little more real, but it's good enough for me. A nice gift to give someone just to say you love them. <end>

 B00061RGC8  Brilliant Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire 3mm Band Sterling Silver Ring Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  Pleasantly Surprised..  I ordered this ring and it took a little under a week to get here. It looks very similiar to the picture. The cz is a nice size. The band is a little thinner than shown. I'm very happy with this purchase =)***Update 10/14/11***Ive been wearing this ring since 2007 and I still get compliments on it (and some people even think its real)! It still sparkles like new FIVE YEARS later! <end>  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!  We love this ring. Everyone thinks it is real, including people who know what to look for. We will definitely be purchasing from you again soon! <end>  From a distance, it looks expensive  I bought one expensive platinum + diamond ring for my wife that we afraid it would get damage from wearing it everyday, but instead she would wear it on special occasion. On the other hand, the sterling silver cubic zirconia ring would be okay for everyday wear. It had fooled some of my wife's friends into believing that it was an expensive one. I don't know it would fade/tarn like other reviewer indicated. Time will tell, but for the price it probably worth it. Only one thing, I wish the seller would send/mail out the ring asap since we know how much a $ 4.99 shipping cost would be for this light weight item is ... similar seller charges for only $2.99 for similar item ... then the seller should keep in mind of the buyer expectation and you know what I mean ... <end>  Don't buy it.  I liked the ring at first, but it was tarnishing within 2 days. <end>  Very pretty  I bought this as a gift to myself and I will admit that it is very pretty. It's worth the 10 bucks I paid for it. The setting is slightly off but you don't notice it unless you are really looking. I've washed dishes with it on and it still looks bright. <end>  cheap setting  Even though the stone itself looks really nice, pretty much identical with real diamond, the cheap setting makes the whole ring look cheap.The prongs are obviously asymmetric and disproportional. The band is really thin.I think even putting a real diamond on this ring would look like fake. <end>  brilliant cz sterling silver  i received the product in a timely manner after resolving an address issue the ring is beautiful and really stands up to the harshness of my job. I clean for a living and it really wears well. <end>  love it  the stone is so brilliant and shiny, i love it. the band fits very well also. i am very glad i got this ring. everyone thinks it is real. <end>  Great(  This ring is very beautiful, my fiancee proposed to me with it and i absolutely loved it. It is delicate mine bent a little while i do things, but you can bend it right back to its shape. I would recomend thjs to a guy wanting to propose or just give a nice gift to a lady( <end>  Impressed!  Very pretty ring and awesome service. It was so pretty i just bought another one  ) The ring looks like its worth more than $10.99, it could almost pass for a real ring, especially if you dont analyze it, and honestly who sits there and analyses your ring besides your best friends? I bought this to go on a vacation to Mexico and not have to bring my real Tiffany's ring and i was very please with my choice, looks just like my ring. I was a little nervous about not getting in time since there was a time frame of such date-such date, but the seller delivered as promised the first date that showed on the time frame, i was a happy camper  ) thank you! <end>  love it  I've had this ring for a few weeks now and it's still very shiny. I would highly recommend this ring. very pretty and can easily pass as a real diamond, why waste money on a real one. size of stone is perfect not too big, not too small. <end>  Get what you pay for  I've ordered from Gem Ave before (2x) the band is not 3mm and looks cheapyou get what you pay for. The package was ripped and the box was what looks like pulled apartthe plastic bag the boxed ring came in looked like it had punch though. On top if I'm wanting to returnit I have to pay shipping which was cost of half the puchase not worth it I'll give it to my niece very disappiontedGem Ave <end>  Almost perfect  I would've Liked it so much better if it was princess cut instead of round. It's a beautiful ring and I wear everyday. <end>  Cheap  It looks like it came out of a grocery store gumball machine. I know that it was only $16, but I guess I was expecting a bit more. The prongs were off kilter and the band looks really flimsy. <end>  daughter loves  My Wife and I bought for our 4 year old daughter after she asked us to buy her a ring....She absolutely loves this ring <end>  Great gem crappy band  Great gem crappy cheap band great for the price. Runs a little small. So size up a half or so. <end>  very nice and a very nice price  It looks real enough to pass and even if it didn't I wouldn't care--it's just &#34;bling&#34; and wearing it makes me feel special.... <end>  Meh. Quality is lacking  This ring has a "diamond" that is over sized for how light the actual ring is. Snags on things and the prongs are not sturdy at all. I also bought this other ring and it is way better  [...] Round Cut Cubic Zirconia CZ 925 Sterling Silver Solitaire Ring 0.84 Ct - Nickel Free Engagement Wedding Ring <end>  Nice size stone, good sparkle  Ring is exactly as pictured. The stone is a nice size, not too big and not too small. I wear a size 7 and this fit perfectly. It is light weight and comfortable to wear. <end>  pennypincher  I LOVE this ring! I wear it with my wedding band that is platinum and everyone beleives it is real! <end>  Looks real!  Beautiful ring-good quality for cheap price. I'm asked frequently if it's real. Comfortable and true to size.  -)  -)  -) <end>  Beautiful!  This ring is really pretty and it sparkles, looks real. I wear it when I go out for dinner with friends and I get lots of compliments on the ring. <end>  UGH  It was ok except for the fact there was a chip in the stone I was not happy with the result sorry <end>  Lovely for the money  This ring is just what I wanted - it sparkles and brings me pleasure for MUCH less than a genuine diamond ring. I love it. Much better quality than I was expecting for the price. <end>  Looks so cheap!  Not like the pic! Band is very thin. Looks extremely cheap! Don't think of purchasing. Thinking of sending mine back. <end>  Fake  This ring is very fake looking. The Cubic Zirconia is not clear...I returned it. The size was true, the band is nice, but the rock is very fake looking. <end>  beautiful  This ring is real sterling silver the stone is clear cubic zirconia, its beautifully packaged and for the price ,I got value for my money with this one. <end>  Nooooooo  The 'diamond' is obviously fake. And sooo much bigger than in the picture. Cost wayyy to much for what its worth. So regret getting this ring. <end>  FABULOUS  Where do I begin? I haven't had my ring too long like some of the other comments but... I LOVE it. It was bought as kind of a "just for now" ring until a bigger and better!! But I love it. It sparkles and shines just like real! Couldn't be happier its a great buy! <end>  Beautiful ring  This is a very simple and beautiful ring. Will use on those days traveling when I don't want to risk loosing or having an expensive diamond ring stolen. Good replacement <end>  Gorgeous  This ring is absolutely gorgeous.The sparkle is unbelieveable.The fit is perfect.The stone was a little larger than expected,but still fantastic. <end>  Excellent quality for the price  I purchased this ring during my pregnancy when my fingers were too swollen to wear my real engagement ring. To a casual observer, the ring looks real, the stone has a nice sparkle, the setting is secure, and the band (although slightly lighter weight than gold would be) is attractive and a good simulation of white gold. The product description says it is between 0.925 and 1 carats, but in actuality it looks about 1.3 carats. I've only owned it for a week, so I can't speak to how it wears long term, but I work in a hospital and wash my hands/use hand gel multiple times per hour and so far it still looks great. Also, you can't beat the price. Would definitely recommend. <end>  Don't pass this ring up!!  After having to sell my original wedding set due to a tough economy I was fervently searching for a suitable replacement. I ordered MANY CZ rings and they always left me wanting. I thought I would try one LAST time and BOY I was glad I did! This ring was WAY LESS than all the others and looks twice as nice. It is NOT cheaply made and the stone is totally believable. I will be wearing this with PRIDE until I can afford the "real" thing once again in the future. All I can SAY IS BUY THIS!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!! <end>  Beauiful  I got this ring and it was even more pretty than the picture. I have had lots of compliments about it. <end>  Great Buy!  This is a great product for a great price! My girlfriend (fiancee!!) didn't know it wasn't a real diamond - we agreed that CZ would be fine anyway as it's just a symbol, and she's worked in jewelry before and even she couldn't tell the difference! <end>  OMG!  I love the ring! The diamond is much bigger than i expected! Its a good looking ring for the price <end>  Beautiful ring  I just got this ring and I am very happy with it. The ring arrived in perfect condition. The stone is beautiful and the sparkle from it is amazing. <end>  Beautiful  When I first ordered this ring it was for a kind of temporary engagement ring, me and my boyfriend picked it out and though he wanted to spend a lot of money on a piece of jewelry I figured that could wait till we got more financially stable. When this ring arrived it was honestly more than I expected, the stone is clear cut and the band itself is very durable. People tell me all the time they think it is the closest to real they've ever seen and when I tell them how cheap it was (I don't really mind them knowing, for those I do I just smile and nod), they always gasp and take a second look to see if they can spot a flaw. I may actually keep this ring for a lot longer than I expected it is just beautiful! <end>  Good fake for when I need it  I got this ring because I wanted a ring to wear in place of my engagement ring for an active travel trip abroad to New Zealand. While it doesn't sparkle or look real like my amazing engagement ring, it is still pretty, knocks off my real one enough, and does the job for keeping my fiance close to my heart and ensuring the safety of my real ring while I'm roughing it white water rafting, hiking, kayaking, and swimming abroad. <end>  Nice  I bought this for my son to give his girlfriend as a promise....lol IF She only knew! What a GREAT GOOD DEAL I got on it..this was my 3rd purchase from GEM AVE, and I have to say I cant wait to buy AGAIN! EVERYTHING they have-sell is nice and AFFORDABLE! Shipping is LIGHTENING FAST!!!! <end>  Beautiful engagement ring  This ring is perfect I say why spend thousands when you don't have to? The ring shines perfectly I love this ring! <end>  Sparkly  This diamond is a lot bigger than it looks on here! It's makn me feel all Bling Bling and stuff!!! <end>  Lovely!  Just got this ring in the mail, and I am very impressed! For the price, I was expecting much less, but this ring is very elegant yet simple and petite. It's very sparkly, too! I'm using this as a temporary wedding ring while I wait 3 weeks for my other ring being fixed, but in the meantime, I really like it. Can't yet comment on durability, but I think the stone could pass for a real diamond. Very pretty! <end>  Sparkly  This is a very pretty little ring. From a distance, it's very deceiving. The only thing is that it does have a slight (very slight) white tinge to it, which is actually kind of pretty. It's fooled a few people so far and you can't beat the price. <end>  Amazing!!!!!!!  This is absolutely beautiful! It was a little smaller than I expected. GREAT BUY!!!! It even sparkles in the light. DOES NOT SPARKLE AS MUCH AS A DIAMOND RING BUT STILL A LOT. <end>  6 prong solitare.  The ring came in a cute little present ring box. The band is shiny and the diamond is sparkly. However, when you look closely at the prongs, it looks a little flimsy. However, overall it looks nice. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  She literally thought it was a real diamond ring! It looks amazing! The ring looks as if it could be a $150 diamond ring, when it's actually a CZ $15 one! She loves it, very happy with order. It is a little big, so order a half size down. <end>  Very nice  I am very satisfied with the product. It's not so fragile that it will break or bend quickly, but it has a nice, delicate look to it. <end>  Its alright  Its not a horrible ring. The picture looks a bit better than it actually is. It does have very delicate look. If you look up close, u can tell the thing that holds the stone does not exactly have the "real" look, but I like this ring any way. Of course it doesn't get as many compliments as my real diamond wedding set, but it is good enought to wear to work when you don't wanna get you real stuff messed up. It is pretty...just pretty. Noting more than that. <end>  twoshoes  I was very pleased with the ring when I recieved it! It looked exactley like the picture!And was beautiful.Have gotten many compliments and no one can tell that it isn't real. Even next to my wedding band that has real diamonds in it!Will definately by from Gem Avenue again! Can't beat the price! <end>  Great for an imitation cubic ring  While this is a very inexpensive cubic zirconia ring I think it looks just fine. I'm not trying to fool anyone into thinking this is my engagement ring, but I actually believe that would be entirely possible Unlike some negative comments regarding this product- mine arrived in perfect condition. I found it to be a really great value for the price and if you are shopping for something to fool people with- this might do the trick, but if you don't agree then you have to remember that it is only $8. <end>  great value  nice ring looks very nice considering the cost. Just looking at it i would have guessed considerably more $. <end>  beautiful!  My ring is beautiful! The setting, band size is great! Just what I wanted. <end>  Great Item  Item was what I expected when it was received. The only problem I had was that I ordered the wrong size. Pay extra attention when sizing rings online, or you might get the wrong one when it arrives. <end>  It looks like an engagement ring!  I didn't expect much of this ring, because it cost so little. I thought it would look like something out of a cracker jack box. But it didn't, it exceeded my expectations. It looks like a diamond ring. The silver is shiny and the CZ looks like an expensive brilliant cut diamond. <end>  Nice looking ring  This ring looks very nice. Be careful though, I've already got a scratch in the cz. It's not that noticable. The ring itself hasn't tarnished like another user said - of course, I don't wear it when doing the dishes or taking a shower or anything. It's a nice costume ring that looks great in the daytime or evening. <end>  so-so  in 2010 everyone should be using grade a cz's for these types of fake rings...... i have all kinds of fake cz jewelry and this ring obviously looks fake. there are some great grade a cz rings on ebay if you guys want something that truly sparkles like the real thing... i put this ring next to one of those and it doesn't even come close....... it's a nice little ring, but you can get better for less money.....if you know anything about diamonds this one obviously looks fake and is less brilliant than the picture shown <end>  Awesome  I really liked or i can say love my product which was a ring from this company it was very beautiful and pretty. The service here was incredible and what i really liked about it was how well they parcel the product. They were awesome and i have them 100 percent for there service. <end>  Fine C Z Jewelry  It looks like the real thing. Cubic Zirconia jewelry is very popular these days and this particular jewelry item shows why! <end>  it was a great ring  i bought the ring it shipped in quick and my g/f loves it so if ur looking for a cheap ring that looks good get it. o teh diamond is a bit big but it stil looks good. <end>  great for the price  I think it is a great ring for the price. I already got a couple of compliments about this ring both from guys and gals. The only reason I gave it 4 because I suspect that the shine will become dimmer as the time passes by. Still I think it is a great purchase and I will buy again. <end>  The picture does it no justice  its way prettier in person. although the silver does tarnish, all silver does that. so if you're picky about that just think  "do i want a ring that tarnishes or one that turnes my finger green?" my only issue with this ring is that it easily snags when i try to put my hand in my pocket. <end>  Nice ring  This is a nice ring, but the CZ is too big for me. I bought this and the .925 sterling silver princess cut CZ (from Gem Avenue) as engagement rings because some of the reviews mentioned that the 'stone' on this ring was a little larger than expected. I wanted a small (less than 1k stone), and this was just too big on my hand. I had originally really wanted a round-cut but the princess-cut has a smaller 'stone' and I actually ended up liking the cut better after comparing the two. This is still a nice ring for the money though! Gem Avenue's shipping is quick also! <end>  simple and very real-looking  I have to say that the reviewer who stated that the CZ was slanted in the setting was right -- it is! BUT, it is hard to tell unless one removes it from the finger and examines it closely. I am very happy with the ring. I have a real one exactly like this one but since I dropped it down the sink once and had to have a plumber retrieve it for me (paid the plumber $125), I decided to get a look-alike for daily wear.  ) I am very happy with this ring and have been a loyal gem avenue customer since I purchased the first item from them in the summer! No disappointment yet so far (have purchased 5 times already). I've been wearing this ring since I bought it in September and my husband has not even noticed it (he thought I was wearing the real one). <end>  This ring is pretty good for the money.  This ring is not bad. Basically, I lost the diamond in my engagement ring. The prongs broke and my diamond fell out somewhere on the streets downtown as I rode my bicycle through the city. I was very sad. And my hand felt very lonely. I've been married for 7 years and I've worn that ring for 8.We had a few choices. I could buy a new ring or a new diamond. The thing is, I'm not much on jewelry. My wedding set is all I really own. It was a lovely gesture for my husband to buy me a $1,500 ring when we got engaged, but I can't see spending that sort of money again. When we get our tax return, I'm buying a $1,500 bicycle and I some how have to believe I will get far more enjoyment from that than a ring.I thought about dropping a few hundred on a nicer "fake" ring, but you know what, when it comes down to it, I just want the symbol to be there. I figured if this ring sucked, it was $10. No big deal.When the ring arrived, the cz looked larger than I expected, but I guess I didn't read the description very well. It's about a carat size. I think it would look less fake if it were a tad smaller, but oh well. The band is a bit lackluster next to my actual white gold/diamond wedding band, but it's not terrible.The cz sparkles very nicely in low light settings like bars, restaurants etc. In direct light, it's a bit iffy, as the large flat top surface reflects light instead of refracting it. (I believe this is the correct term.)Overall, it's worth $10. I've worn it for about two weeks and received some compliments. No one has questioned it so far, but I'm also not flat out showing it to people/flashing it around. I'm simply wearing it as I have worn my other ring for the past 8 years.I will say that the band is already scratched up, but I'm very very tough on jewelry. I never take my rings off and my gold band is pretty roughed up at this point as well. <end>  not what i expected  the ring was nothing like I thought it would be. It was cheap looking. Maybe others who ordered this ring and wrote great reviews got a better product. The one I received was so cheap. I will be returning this ring. <end>  Too nice for it's price...  More than what I expected. Got it for sale. Very pretty for a very affordable price. I did not regret buying this. <end>  BEAUTIFUL  THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT IS WONDERFUL. I'M PLANNING TO BUY ANOTHER FROM YOUR SITE. THANK YOU AGIAN. <end>  decent  Why oh why do the people who make CZ rings insist on having the stones be eqivalent to 1 ct + diamonds. I looked for an inexpensive .5 CZ for over a week and finally bought this one even though I thought it was a little big. It is, it looks slightly bigger than a 1 ct diamond, and it looks fake. I did find some .5 CZ from a couple of "high end CZ" sellers, but they wanted over $150 for the end product.., way more than I was willing to spend.My .5 ct solitaire diamond engagement ring went missing, but I still had the "wrap" that went around it to complete my wedding band set, (I still have no idea how they became seperated, and suspected theft).., and I ordered this to fit in wedding set.., it did fit. I wear a 9, and the band was actually closer to an 8.5, so it just barely fit. (and you may want to order up if you choose this ring) The band looks a little smaller than pictured, but I think that's just because the stone is really too big to look real. The band is comfortable though, and even though I think it was sized slightly small, it is a decent band. The stone is set a little high for me.I read a lot of reviews in my hunt for this ring, and I think the sellers could really benefit from reading this.., BUYERS WANT ACCESS TO .25 AND .5 CZ'S THAT ARE STILL IN BANDS OF REAL METAL, and priced well. One of the prongs was bent outward a little, but that was easy to fix. Overall, for the price, I would have to list it as a good purchase.., the quality of the CZ, the band, and the setting were all very good for the price.., and because the description was accurate as to the size of the stone, I gave it 3 stars.PS. I found my diamond ring! No one stole it, it was under a dresser.., still have no idea how that happend..., <end>  Thank you, science.  Five years and counting, that's how long my wife and I've been married and she still thinks her engagement ring is real. Well, I owe it all to the jewelry magicians over at Gem Avenue. Having to get married was bad enough, but no way was I going to shell out the long green for a relationship I wasn't even sure was going to last. So when I found out $7.99 was all I had to cough up to quiet down my old lady and lock in a cush job at her Dad's cardboard box factory, it didn't take me long to pop the ol' question. Criminy, I spent more on the dinner at Bennigans than I did for the ring. It was that darn potato skins appetizer that put me over. Anywho, she totally went for it, and to this day she still thinks it's a genuine carat diamond. Sure, she only has one good eye resulting from a freak macram&eacute; accident, but her family and friends seem to have bought off on it too. And when the old conscience flares up and I start to think maybe my whole marriage was based on a big lie, I like to tell myself that I'm not fooling my wife so much as I'm embracing a new cost saving technology. <end>
 B00061RGDM  Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire 3mm Band Sterling Silver Ring Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  Great Replacement  I had to get larger rings while I was pregnant and wanted something nice to wear. This ring is very beautiful and I got several compliments from admirers. This is pretty close to the look of my original wedding/engagement ring, so I felt right at home wearing it. <end>  disappointed  The ring looked foggy and not clear. I wore it for two day's and took it off. I'll probably replace the stone with a better one because the setting was sterling silver. <end>  Gorgeous Marquise for such a low price!  Exactly what I was hoping for. The Cubic Zirconia is sparkly and the perfect size. Fits accurately and the color is perfect Sterling Silver. The only thing that made me a bit sad was the band, which got marked up a little somehow, either in warehouse or during transit, but luckily it's not enough to make me fuss, plus for the price, if need be I could replace it at some point rather than return it for shipping costs that are pricier. <end>  Gorgeous marquise ring  I love my ring, it fits perfectly, I ordered it on a Saturday, it arrived Thursday.I had been wanting to buy a ring for quite a while now, and I love this one.The stone is gorgeous, it shines in low lighting. My only complaint is that the band has received many scratches since I got it.. I blame it on my wearing it almost non-stop, but then again I don't do anything extreme that I would expect to scratch it. The band is very thin, it hasn't lost it's shape, but it took some getting used to a band this thin.Overall, I still love this ring, the scratches aren't enough to make me regret getting it. <end>  great product, not so great shipping.  The ring is very nice but shipping took longer than expected. <end>  Not bad for the price  Gem i shinny. It is real silver. I am allergic to anything other then silver. The Gem is a little over sized for the band but overall it is very pretty. I ordered it and it actually arrived earlier then the date they estimated. <end>  Good ring for the money  The only con to this ring is that the prongs were a little miss aligned. And other were some small scratches next to mounting.Pros - .925 and it seems like a good sturdy ring, and the CZ is clear and exceeded expectations <end>  Pretty, for a great price!  The ring is exactly as its pictured, the solataire cut is gorgeous and sparkly. My only concerns are the height of the stone (I am constatly getting it caught on things or bumping things with it) and the stone itself is a tad bit crooked, not enough to really notice though. all in all, I love it. People are always complimenting me on it and they think its the real deal! <end>  big stone but nice ring  The only thing I don't like about the ring is that the stone is a bit too big for (for me). I like the smaller stones and didn't realize it would be this big. But... it is a nice ring for the price. The CZ looks real. <end>  SS Marquiz solitaire  I love this ring. My wedding band is gold but I wear a lot of silver jewelry and wanted something to match without spending a fortune. This is perfect. It matches my wedding ring and is absolutely beautiful. Super product, super price and super fast shipping. I couldn't be any happier. <end>  more than nice  this ring is beautiful. i see that one person got a foggy cz but i must say mine is gorgeous. the sparkle is amazing. i am very pleased with this ring. <end>  gem jewelery  this was the 3rd ring I brought from gem, the stone itself is flawless, the band is very nice and its silver, the price is far below what I think they could charge, the very same ring in my town retails for 29.00, they are selling it at a discount for 19.95, gem charges 6.99..and there jewelery is beautiful..there rings look far better then the photo makes them out to appear. they have won my business on these levels, PRICE, QUAILITY, SERVICE,thank you gem..please keep my email and let me know of future products and sales! <end>
 B00061RGDW  Clear Cubic Zirconia 3mm Solitaire Band Sterling Silver Ring Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  ok ring  The ring was real pretty and sparkly! But the band scratched real easily! I'll continue to wear it, till I get a new ring! What can you expect from a cheap ring! Brilliant Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire 3mm Band Sterling Silver Ring Size 5 <end>  Pretty Nice just one downside  this is a very nice ring, after i misplaced my other purity ring iam currently using this one. the only downside is it only comes with 4 prongs not 6 like viewed in the picture <end>  Love It!!  I just received this ring, and I'm loving it. It is exactly what I've been looking for. The ring is dainty, and the picture on Amazon doesn't do it justice. It also came in a cute box with a bow on it. The ring has 4 prongs rather than 6, but I still definitely recommend Gem Avenue.  ) <end>  A great ring "Faux" any occassion!  I received this ring yesterday. Sizing was spot on. Although it came as reviewed with FOUR PRONGS, it looks great. Super sparkle in a White Diamond facet cut. I only wish the top prong did not hide the Heart Cut notch.Best of the buys in CZ. <end>  Beautiful quality sterling ring for young girl  Since we are a family of non-yellow gold and allergic reactions to various metals, I purchased this for a young girl. The band is of sterling silver and quality made (doesn't bend or oxidize). The heart-shaped Cubic Zirconia is set in well within the prongs so as not to worry about it coming loose. It came in a heart-shaped jewelry box and the ring is kept there when not in use.I purchased it at a great price at the time. Overall, the small investment for this gifted ring was worth every penny. <end>  4 Prong, not 6 Prong Setting really loses the stone!  Arrived quickly, very pretty. Setting not as pictured. Ring only worn for two months (Not for chores or anything that could harm a ring). LOST STONE! Now pretty EMPTY PROMISE RING! Very disappointed. <end>  Pretty Ring  Pretty ring, but I think I'll give it to my daughter when she gets a little older looks more like a child ring. Be a great gift for a teen or an 10 year old <end>  not as shown  Disappointed... picture shows a bright stone. Mine was dull and the prong setting is not what is shown in picture. <end>  Cute for the price  Like other reviewers, the ring I received was also set with 4 prongs instead of 6, and is set slightly crooked - but no one else will notice! I wear a standard ring size 7, but this ring in a size 7 was a bit loose for me, so I wear it on my middle finger instead of my ring finger (which in retrospect is probably a good thing, because even on my middle finger I've had people think that it's a wedding ring). <end>  retromommy  Love the heart ring. It looks very elegant. No one can tell its a fake..sshhh.. and everyone asks " when are you getting married?" The silver keeps its shine. The stone needs to be polished up and cleaned in the back once in awhile. BUT its beautiful. I have my eye on the pink heart ring. <end>  Dazzling and bright!  I purchased this ring for myself, and I get so many comments on it when I wear it! It is so pretty and dazzling and bright on your finger..you will love this ring!! <end>  SO cheap looking  I have never written a review for any item that I have purchased at AMAZON, but this was so ugly and cheap looking. It doesnt even look like a heart, but rather like a pear shape. It look very cheap like a 25cents toy. I want a refund. <end>  Amazing for such a cheap price.  My girlfriend has a limit on how much I can spend on gifts for her, so I can't buy anything expensive. I wanted to give her something really nice but stay within the limit. This is the best looking ring I've seen for the price. I've been to places like Walmart and Target, but this simply beats them in comparison when I was looking for a sterling silver ring with a heart shape. The Cubic Zirconia looks brilliant and shines beautifully. I gave it to her today for our 1 year and she's very happy. She treasures it and it makes us both feel good that if she does in fact lose it during sports or school, we can easily replace it and keep a smile on our face. I bought two rings in different sizes because I wasn't completely sure on the size of her finger. The first ring fit and the second ring doesn't. The ring looks so good though, I decided to put it on a necklace to have around my neck so both me and my girlfriend can match even when we aren't together. <end>  Very cute  I was looking for a cute ring for my daughter. She loves it! Thanks. <end>  Sucks  Bought for every day wear. The stone in the first one fell out, so I returned it and ordered another. Same thing happened less than a week later. <end>  Exactly as Great as the picture  This ring is amazing! The stone is a perfect size, not to large or to small (which is what you run into with a lot of rings you find online), the band is a very pretty color and the fit is true to size! Very nice and highly recommended for any occasion! <end>  A perfect fit!  I LOVE this ring though the stone is alittle loose but I'm gonna find a way to fix it so I can wear it again!!! <end>  Love it  I love this ring and I hope my daughter does to.if not i will keep for my self.i love the ring <end>  wonderful ring  this product is amazing. the band like many mention is smaller than it appears on the picture but i'm perfectly fine with that.i have gotten many compliments since the moment i first wore it. i am very pleased with it. its small and simple but beautiful. the stoneshines like a real diamond and it looks amazing on. i recommend it to anyone looking for something affordable and cute. <end>  i wanted to love this  i recieved the ring today just now actually and i noticed it is a for prong ring not six and the stone is loose i hope i can get it fixed i really want to where this ring. the reason the stone is loose is because the prong is bent if i can straighten it out i might be able to where it. dissapointed <end>  My Wife Loves it!  I am glad I purchased this ring, it now one of her favorites! I like everything about it and and she loves it. I choose 5 stars because it made really happy. I would recommend this ring and others I purchase to any of my female friends and/or the boyfriends, husbands, and whatever.Thank you <end>  Excellent for the price, but the size is wrong  I bought this cheap ring ($14 included shipping) to try jewelry on amazon, and worked perfect. My wife has this ring for over 3 years and it still shines like new. The Zirconia is a bit scratched, but for the price is excellent. Just be careful with the size, according to the chart my wife was 10, but when she got the ring it was too big, she is a 9. It is better to go to a jeweler to get the size. <end>  Beautiful!!!  One of the most beautiful rings I own! No one can tell it's not a real diamond!!! I purchased a princess cut two years ago, and this is my second purchase. The rings are so pretty! My next puchase will be the marquise when they have it in my size!!! <end>  !  I ordered this ring to be a purity ring and I really love it. It's shiny and it's a great reminder when I look at it. The only downside is that it has been taken as a wedding ring a few times and that made for some interesting conversation. But it's beautiful and I don't regret my purchase. <end>  Perfect Purity Ring  My daughter has had so many compliments on this ring. It looks beautiful on her finger and she wears it with a smile. At 15, it is a little scary to spend hundreds of dollars on a ring that may get misplaced or lost so this is the perfect price and product for this time in her life. <end>  Ring  I absolutely love this ring. I always wear sterling silver jewelry and this ring matches with it perfectly. <end>  Add some sparkle to a drab day  I bought this ring for my daughter. She usually wears gold with gemstones and matches them to her outfits. I bought this fabulous ring for her along with a plain silver band to brighten up her hands instead of the same gaudy rings she has. Everyone at her employment has given her compliments on it and many of her customers have commented on how lovely it is. Her sister was so taken by it that I have just ordered a similar ring for her to enjoy as well. Great price and this seller is fantastic, this is the one I will stick with from now on. <end>  VERRY GOOD RING  I like the ring alot is perfect i just hope it does last and nothing happens to it <end>  Beautiful Ring  Nice, bold ring. I like the heart shape; it is cute. The stone is a little big, but if you use it with a plain wedding band, looks georgeous. In addition, you can use a stainless steel watch and the look is complete. <end>  Love It  Great Ring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ) love it got it on time can't ask for any thing more then at right??????!!!! will order angain soon <end>  Excellent ring for price!  I got this ring for christmas for my 14 year old daughter and she loved it. I thank you and would purchase from you again... <end>  great ring  It was great ring. i was not expecting that good ring in that price. It is great ring with clear stone. i would recommend that to every one. It can be really good friendship ring or you can give it to your girlfriends if you cannot afford fancy and expensive diamonds. Also seller is great we can trust them. Shipment was on time and in great condition. <end>  Promise Ring  Well I just want to say this is a beautiful ring and it is making my wife's day. I love it its the best. <end>  Wonderful  This ring is wonderful, and as one reviewer commented the craftsmanship is amazing. Nicely cut heart shape CZ placed in a sterling silver band ( very elegant ). It is a lovely gift that will be cherish a lifetime. Great price too. <end>  Disappointed...  The ring is cute, but clearly not very high quality...also the heart stone is slightly crooked which was just distracting enough to make me not want to wear the ring. If I were able to go back and re-buy this ring, unfortunately I would probably spend my money on something else. <end>  Looks great and good price too!  I gave this ring and a necklace to my girlfriend for our anniversary and she loved this heart shaped ring more than the butterfly necklace. She seemed very happy when she saw it and it was just a great buy!Just make sure you know your beloved's ring size before-hand  )Thank you! <end>  Marleene In Palm Bay, Florida  I love this ring, its so pretty. I would buy from Gem Avenue anytime. Very elegant ring.Marleene SPalm Bay, Florida <end>  Did Not Recieve It  The item never came but I am happy with the service they refunded me my money. A little disappointed that it did not come because I was looking forward to wearing it so much. <end>  Heart Cut Women's Ring  I absolutely adore this ring! It's perfect! It carries the appearance of a jewelry item more expensive than it actually is and I've received many compliments on it. 5 stars! <end>  Beautiful ring, poor creation  This is a beautiful ring. I wore it for 5 days & got lots of compliments. However, on the 5th day I looked down & the cubic zirconia stone was missing. I wondered, after I got it, if I should have had it tightened. I didn't and now I have a silver band missing the stone. <end>  nice ring but only four prongs  I got the ring today. It was delivered sooner than I had expected, which was good. The ring looks nice. The stone is clear and sparkle. The band width is as described. However, there are only four prongs, not six prongs as was described. I don't mind that it only has four prongs, but I expected six prongs from the description. Also, the stone is loose a bit. I can twist it and see it move. The stone could've been set tighter if it is six prongs rather than four. I hope the stone won't fall off any time soon. <end>  BUBBLE GUM RING  I thought I could wear this ring to save some wear and tear on my diamond but NO WAY would I have ordered it if I would have known it was so cheap. The stone looks plastic and the silver looks fake especially around the setting--looks like it came from a bubble gum machine.Worst of all the setting is not as depicted in the picture it is a four prong not six.Don't waste your time, this thing is going back no matter the cost to me just to make the point. <end>  Beautiful!  The picture does not do the ring justice. It is much more beautiful in person. The only potential problem I see is that the band of the ring is somewhat thin. It might bend in the future, but I can't be sure. (Note  The ring I ordered is a size 10, so that might affect the thinness of the band). But I love this ring - it is absolutely beautiful! <end>  NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE  so it shines a little but so many imperfections the metal band is cheap disformed and tarnished within an hour of wearing it, i think simply cuz its cheap metal and got wet. the heart doesnt look allot like a heart untill you get close up. cute if its gunna be a play ring or for a yooung teen. as far as wearing this thing im ashamed  ( <end>  Wonderful product!  I bought this ring for my teenage daughter for Valentine's Day and she absolutely loves it! She also loved the box that it came in. She wears it to school and just about everywhere. On the rare occasion that she isn't wearing it I like to borrow it for myself. The delivery was fast and the ring is of great quality. I am very satisfied with the product and Gem Avenue. <end>  Well done!  Gem Avenue did a wonderful job of getting this item to me in tip-top condition! I love the little box it comes in, and I know my girlfriend will love it to! I may have ordered it a bit small, but if so, I'll get another and she can keep them both! A great job and two thumbs up to Gem Avenue for speedy delivery, great packaging, and amazing craftsmanship! <end>  Prongs dissapointing, band small  The band width appears smaller in real life than the picture, and the stone only has 4 prongs not the six pictured. Fit is good and stone is nice and sparkly, it just doesn't look like the picture. <end>  Very surprised!  I purchased this ring as a travel ring, and I must say, I absolutely love this ring. It doesn't look or feel fake, and actually sparkles almost like a real diamond under the light. I received a four-prong ring, instead of the six prong shown in the picture, but that is hardly an issue to me, the ring is gorgeous.The only problem I had with this ring is that there were bits and pieces of fluffy material, sort of like tissue paper wedged under the prongs. It's not obvious, but on closer inspection, it's definitely there.I'm so pleased with this ring that I've went and purchased one in pink and aquamarine as well! <end>  Lovely Heart Band  I ordered this ring as a gift and I loved it! I wear it constantly and get lots of compliments! It does get a little dull over time and the heart on my ring was actually a little crooked! But this is hardly noticeable when I'm wearing the ring. The stone also shows no sign of falling out! <end>  Love it  This is a beautiful ring and for the money, it is a great value! I didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. <end>  She Was So Happy  Hi there i bought the ring for my finace and she was so happy that i bought the ring for her is trying to get use to it, and i am going to buy my wedding from GEMS. It looks like the picture Exactly and is perfect for the engagement ring or a gift for any holiday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SHE LOVED IT <end>  Perfect  I bought this as a promise ring. She loved it. And the Box. It was awesome. Wooooo! <end>  Perfect  My daughters eyes lite up so very bright when she put this ring on. She hasn't taken it off since putting it on her finger. It is beautiful. Very nice and shiney. High quality. This item was sent in a very pretty box and she keeps the box beside her bed. It is just perfect. I highly recommend Gem Avenue. Great items, super fast shipping, and no nonsense like with a lot of online purchases. The items are exactly as described. This seller is honest, informative, and very nice. I will purchase other items from Gem Avenue as this item was exactly as described. Thanks for making my daughters eyes shine. Joy <end>  I Appreciate this service  I really really adore and cherish their service because they do they possible best to please and serve there customers and the products are just so incredible and beautiful. <end>  You get what you pay for  This ring isnt very durable. The gem feels loose and the metal isnt very solid. It looks good but the quality isnt there. Great for a highschooler or a cheap promise ring. My girlfriend liked it though. But really its the thought that counts! <end>  Veeery nice  Very nice work,for this price it's totally a excellent purchase..This ring doesn't have the bad looking endings that I use to find in this kind of products..Also Gem Av. has a great service. <end>  Great As A Gift.  I bought this ring for my gf as a promise ring gift to her. She loves it and she wears it everyday, it looks really beautiful it stands out and to me it does not look cheap. Although its only near 10 bucks it looks nice and it stands out. <end>  Sparkles and shines  I bought this along with another solitaire as backup to my real gold and diamonds set. The stone is large enough to be noticable, but not gaudy and fake as some of the larger stones. Its a simple and elegant look. My hands are smaller, so the smaller stone looks realistic. My husband was even impressed! I like that its sterling and not a plated metal, so it will stand up to all the cleaning solutions my hands are in. I would recommend this ring to anyone who likes understated elegance. Its definitely not for someone who likes in-your-face flash. <end>  nice ring  )  looks just like the picture  big rock and shiny band. i just got it so hopefully it's last me a while because it's very cute & feminine. the rock is large but it's okay  ) <end>  Beautiful ring  My granddaughter saw this ring and loved it. She has a birthday next week and I ordered it for her. It is going to be a surprise. I opened the package and looked at it, and fell in love with it. We both love, and have the same taste in jewelry and I know she is gonna love it. Cant wait to give it to her. Great value for the quality. Very quick delivery. We love Amazon.com. <end>  Queen of Hearts  I absolutely love this ring and hardly ever take it off. It's brilliance is uncomparable.I ordered a plain band to forcus mainly on the beautiful heart ring. <end>  I heart this ring  My bf bought this ring for replace my stolen promise ring. It is absolutely gorgeous in person. The picture hardly does it justice. It sparkles almost as wonderfully as a real diamond. In any light it is eye catching ^,^ I am very happy with it. You won't be sad if you get this ring. It came in a very timely manner, we got it in just a couple days and we paid for standard shipping. <end>  Horrible product  I am very unhappy with this product. Not only does the CZ look plastic, it fell out after two days of wearing it. I have never been more disappointed with a piece of jewelry than this one. Do not buy it. The ring itself looks like it came out of a quarter machine. I'm not sure what kind of ring everyone else got to give it such glowing reviews, but mine was definitely nowhere near their descriptions. <end>  Shiny as I wanted  Nice ring for its price. I really liked how shiny it is. It has a good weight not light which makes it as a real ring. <end>
 B00062BISU  Sterling Silver Snake 1.4mm Chain Necklace 20" ||	  Very nice. Holds its "curve" when worn with pendants.  One problem I always have with pendants is that they tend to weigh down the chain into a "V" and then get stuck on a link and slip to one side or the other. This chain is thick and stiff enough to keep your pendants hanging straight. The stiffness also compliments more modern jewelry designs. <end>  Durable  i bought this over 6 months ago and i am still wearing it from that day, its perfect and durable, recommended <end>  Great bargain!  I really wasn't clear on the exact size of this necklace when I ordered it. I was ecstatic when it arrived. It is not too thin, not too thick, just right. It is well made and has a sturdiness to it. My daughter ordered one after she saw mine. It is a true bargain for the price. <end>  Much nicer than expected  This is a great bargain that can be used with many slides. I'd say go for it! <end>  Beautiful and sturdy  This chain is beautiful and sturdy... and shiny... not much else to say about it.  ) <end>  this is a beautiful chain  This chain is tougher than many chains, it looks nice, fits nice and is made of silver. I put a pendant from another necklace where the chain was too flimsy, I like this one much better and I fee it should last a long time. <end>  Do not buy it!  I have to clean it every time I wear it. It is not sterling .925. I have a lot of sterling and have never had this happened to me. So not worth the money  ( <end>  Great chain bought several......  Great chain bought several.....Sterling Silver Snake 1.4mm Chain Necklace 20"....great price nice quality!~Very Happy with purchase!~I recommend this chain great prime item! <end>  lovely chain  This is a very pretty chain - sturdy and smooth. Clasp is a bit tricky, though. <end>
 B00062J1G6  Designer Sterling Silver Citrine, Peridot, Garnet, Brazilian Amethyst Clip Earrings ||	  Pretty but flawed  The design and stones were very beautiful. However, one of the clips would not stay fastened and needed to be repaired before they could be worn. The recipient was very disappointed. <end>
 B00062J88W  Designer Sterling Silver Brazilian Amethyst Bracelet ||	  Looked more impressive online...  I'll be honest up front, I'm not much of an expert with jewelry. It looked impressive online, but when we got it I was somewhat disappointed. The latch (or hook, whatever you call it) was a bit difficult to use so it wasn't easy to put on the wrist. Also, the silver loops looked a bit cheesy. My wife states that she thought it was very nice so it could just be me. <end>
 B00063DN8C  Sterling Silver CELTIC Knot Green Crystal Ring(Sizes 6,7,7.5,8,9) ||	  Love it  D  My daughter says "It is really pretty and I love it." It does not stain her finger. A good deal! <end>
 B00063E4C6  Boma Sterling Silver Tiny Stud Earrings ||	  What it should be!  The earings are small but cute! They are great if you have a second piercing in you ears. They really compliment my hoops i wear in my first set of holes! Something silver is great to work with too! <end>  useless studs  The backs on both of the earrings were severly bent. After filing a complaint, they sent me a return shipper (they paid postage) and my account was given a full refund for the purchase including shipping. they were just as I expected, but the backs were just bent beyond use. <end>
 B00063K10A  St Jude Thaddeus Round Medal 14K Yellow Gold 18.0mm with 18 inch necklace ||	  18 inch necklace was excellent quality  The product was exactly what I expected and was delivered in a timely manner. <end>
 B00063NAGW  jc2321czm-7 Solitaire Pink CZ .925 Silver Ring Size 7 ||	  Very pretty  I ordered this ring with the intention of trying out different styles for a right hand ring. I was genuinely surprised with the size of it! I was expecting a nice dainty little ring but instead found a larger ring that shines beautifully. I've worn it for about 2 days and it hasn't tarnished yet. Here's to hoping that it doesn't. The stone in the picture is a little darker (as stated). It's actually a very pretty pink. The band nicks easy, but no one is going to look that closely at your ring. All in all, a very nice ring for the price. I'm gonna go look for more similar products to this one. <end>
 B000643G2E  Men's Panther Link High Grade Titanium Metal Jewelry Bracelet, 8" Long ||	  love it  I love this bracelet and wear it at least once a week. very light and very masculine looking <end>
 B000643PQ6  Pewter and Cat's Eye Bracelets ||	  Pretty but very poor quality  These bracelets were pretty online, and pretty in their box, but the clasps are cheap and every single one broke on the first or second use. They were a gift and by the time I found that out it was beyond too late to try and return them. Save your money, admire the pictures and spend your dollars on something else. <end>
 B000644W6I  Cute Stretchy Peach Aventurine Bracelet ||	  GREAT BRACELET!  I love these bracelets! I have about ten of them in different colors. This one is perfect with peach or tan colored clothing. Wish this seller would get these back in stock! They fit my 6 and ahalf inch wrist with a little leeway. Not too tight, but would not fit an 8 inch wrist. Mine is slightly paler in color than the pic, but still a pretty color. <end>  Beautiful Bracelet, Beautiful Price  The Peach Aventurine Bracelet by "Cute Stretchy Gems" is beautifully doneand fits a size 7" wrist very comfortably. <end>
 B00064A6WC  Sterling Silver Antique Style Filigree CZ Ring Size 5.5(Sizes 5.5,7.5,8.5) ||	  Lovely to Look At  This ring is certainly worth the price. It is a wonderful addition to my collection. A good buy. <end>
 B00064A6WW  Sterling Silver Antique Style Filigree CZ Ring Size 7.5(Sizes 5.5,7.5,8.5) ||	  Lovely to Look At  This ring is certainly worth the price. It is a wonderful addition to my collection. A good buy. <end>
 B00064CAX0  Oval Opal Earrings ||	  Oval Opal Earrings!!  I love these earrings! I had been searching for a YEAR for something to match a necklace that I already owned. These were PERFECT! <end>
 B00064URDA  Aesculapius Staff Snakes Wings Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Bad buy  This is a huge waste of money I had it for about a month when the part that holds the symbol to the necklace broke. I seriously not wasting your money on this low quality item <end>  Caduceus...not Staff of Asclepius.  Do your research people. This is a Caduceus...commonly mistaken for the symbol of the medical field. The correct symbol for the medical field is the Staff of Asclepius (found with different spellings) which is a worm around a stick. The symbol comes from the way a Guinea worm is removed from an infected person's body. It's rolled around a stick and removed slowly over weeks or months. One worm...not a snake...on a stick without wings.The Caduceus is a totally different story with a different origin and was mistakenly used as the medical field's symbol somewhere in history. <end>  Not the rod of Aesculapius!  Instead, this is the Caduceus--look it up. Nice try, guise, but no cigar. Not even related to the rod of Aesculapius, which has only one snake and no wings. <end>
 B00064UROO  Hard Rock Heavy Electric Metal Skull Pewter Ring, Size 9 ||	  Geat ring, great buy  I've been looking for the perfect skull ring and I finally found it. Great quality and workmanship. I have fairly small hands and was worried that the skull might be to big and cumbersome but its the perfect size. <end>  Looks better in person  Looks a lot better in person. Great ring... I get a lot of compliments on it. <end>  biker ring  I love this ring. It has a great great shape, shine, color and weight. This ring is worth the price. <end>  Fun!  Great ring, different that the others since it has a squat face. going to wear this one out fast, may need to buy another! <end>  A great ring  I ordered the ring on a Friday and got it the next Monday.Very fast shipping & the ring looks great.I will be buying from this seller again.Thanks!! <end>
 B00064URQC  Butterfly Filigree Print Pattern Pewter Bracelet ||	  Just Wonderful  I really enjoyed shopping with this company. I ordered the butterfly braceletBUTTERFLY Filigree Print Pattern Silver Tone PEWTER BRACELETas an stocking stuffer late around December 18th for my daughter-in-law. I did not pay the extra shipping and to my surprise it arrived on the 22nd!!! I appreciate the prompt and excellent service and the product was very nice and sent in a cute little draw string pouch(a nice touch). My daughter-in-law loved the gift.

 B00064US7K  Skull And Crossbones Pewter Bracelet ||	  Nice  I am very impressed with the bracelet. Nice thick material. I am very pleased with my purchase and service I received. <end>  Good service but...  I bought this product and it broke (snapped in half) within an hour of wearing it. Bad quality. But great service. <end>  Very Nice  This bracelet is great, I've had it for years and it's never broken or stained. The metal is very flexible and has never broken even though I've adjusted it a million times. I really love it! <end>
 B00064US8Y  Chinese Virtuous Rabbit Symbol Pewter Ring Band, Size 8 ||	  I Love it!!!  I will sum up this product in three words that describe it. I Love it!!! <end>
 B00064USCK  Celtic Dolphin Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Quite nice  The Celtic Dolphin is quite nice. It is a welcome addition to anyone who loves dolphins and is Pagan. The Celtic design makes the dolphin pendant extra special. <end>  unique dolphin/celtic pendant  This is a unique gift for the person who loves dolphins and is of Irish descent. Beautiful workmanship and design. <end>  Unique Celtic design  Another animal-inspired design from this excellent vendor, beautiful crafted. It is detailed, hangs balanced, and is sturdy. I bought it as a gift, and it was really appreciated! <end>  DOLPHIN PENDANT  MY WIFE LOVES THE PENDANT AND NOW WEARS IT OFTEN AS SHE CONNECTSWITH MARINE MAMALS AND VOLUNTEERS AT A RECOVERY CENTER <end>  Not Bad  Hanging eye is unusually large. Only finished on one side -- the other side is hollow. Overall not bad with a nice design, but slightly disappointing in the execution. <end>  Beautiful  This is a beautiful, yet different looking dolphin pendant. It would be much better if it came with a silver chain necklace instead of the rope, but I love the dolphin. <end>  Good Looking  Great pendant and looks fantastic. Eye is a little large but works well. It is just what I was looking for. <end>  Good quality and service  This is a present for my Grandson. The quality is very nice. He had one just like it before and lost it. He really loved it, and asked for another one for Christmas. <end>
 B00064USEI  Red Rhinestone Celtic Thor's Hammer Pewter Pendant ||	  Nice quality  This item has a nice pitted/hammered reverse.The weight is just right not too heavy or light.The black string adjusts to any lenght from 16" to 32" after you put it around your neck,as do alot of the black string items. <end>  Beyond Satisfied  I was so happy when i saw that i had received this in the mail, it had only been a couple days since i placed the order. And i may not be a jewelry expert but the size and material this pendant is made of makes this purchase totally worth it. Not to mention the price cannot be beat. I highly recommend you buy this if you are looking for any pagan peaces. <end>  celtic cross  This came in very quickly and packaged very nicely. I would order again from this company! <end>  Thor-oughly lovely!  My grand daughter loves the Avengers so I bought her this Thor's Hammer neclace for Christmas and she really liked it. It is bigger than you expect it to be but is a great gift item. <end>  Exactly What Thor Would have wanted  This fine piece of jewelry was exactly what I want in a Thor's hammer. I wanted something heavy, stylish with character and its exactly what I wanted. I haven't taken it off since I got it for close to no money it is a very good pendant. Its heavy enough to notice but not to heavy and the design of Celtic type knots are very well done. I was very impressed by this piece! Definitely worth it. =] <end>  My 2nd one  I love this hammer, this is the 2nd one I have purchased from Dan Jewelers as the 1st one I lost along with my necklace. <end>  Cool hammer  I've worn this since receiving it in the mail. Its a nice design ad I find it comforting. A number of people told me they like it. <end>  mighty Thor  This is my third purchase of this Red Celtic Thor necklace. I brought one for myself, one for my man and now a new one also for my man who lost the first one. Necklace looks regal and packs a mighty energy source to it. Great for those in love with Thor Hammers <end>
 B00064USF2  Spiked Scimitar Sword Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Nice necklace, but I found it for much cheaper than on here  I got this same necklace in a 2 for $10 deal at the South FL Fair. Same exact necklace. On the card I got was the website [...], where you'll find it for $5.95. They also sell a bunch of other really nice pendants, all for the same price. I was surprised to come across it on here for so much money. <end>
 B00064USLG  Tribal Style Chief Totem Pole Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Utterly bendable  I'm used to the malleability of pewter, but this was ridiculous. Bent all-to-hell just from normal wear. Wouldn't suggest to a friend. <end>
 B00064USOS  Skull Thor's Hammer Thor Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Cool Necklace  This came exactly as advertised and expected. It is a very sturdy piece of pewter, and comes with a good string to hang around your neck, but offers a good sized hole at the top to accommodate other chains, ropes, etc. <end>  Got what I paid for  You get what you paid for here. It looks good, but a bit small. Exactly what is shown in customer review pictures though. For what I paid for it though, not a bad buy. <end>  An Excellent Necklace, I just Wish It Came With a Chain  This necklace looks great, I'm really impressed with the design and detail. My only grip is that it has a string and not a chain, but this can be changed if you really want to. The item got here quickly just like all my other orders from Dan Jewelers. <end>  Skull Thor's Hammer Pendant  I got this for my boyfriend and he is very happy with it and hasn't taken it off since I gave it to him. Thanks!-Kelley <end>  Thor's Hammer Necklace  Mjollnir, Thor's Hammer, with a skull where the hammer meets the shaft. Pewter.Nice workmanship.Speedy delivery. No flaws. Good previous service. Will continue to work with vendor.Awesome product. <end>  Everything I hoped it would be...  Buying jewelry online is always a hit or miss and I've done both several times, but this was EXACTLY as advertised and perfect like the picture. No 'enhancements' whatsoever. I gave it as a gift to someone dear to me, and got those wonderful "It's exactly what I wanted" which is always the best. You never want the "Oh...thanks...I'll..I'll put it on later" Hah! <end>  Amazing  thats all i can say amazing, great quality. fast shipping, and it comes with a discount code!!buy it! <end>  A damn fine product!  I ordered the Skull Thor's Hammer at the beginning of the week, and recieved it under a week later. Speedy delivery is always note worthy. It arrived on the same day as another Mjolnir pendant I paid over triple the price for . . . and I must say . . . I'm VERY impressed. The craftsmanship is superb on this pendant. Additionally I bought a silk chord to put it on, only to realize I didn't need it, as the chord included is very nice, and has a great adjustible set up. If all the Dan's Jewelry pieces of of this quality, I see no reason to buy from anywhere else. <end>
 B00064USPW  Celtic Pattern Butterfly Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Go ahead and buy it  I gave it fives stars for arriving on time and just as described on the web site. The rest is up to your taste. <end>
 B00064USWA  Oroborus Dragon Circle Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Very cool looking!  I'm using this as a car a charm and it works very nicely. The circle diameter is about 1 inch in length. <end>  perfect  I absolutely love this. I wear it everyday and it doesn't tarnish, is scratch resistant, and is overall a great buy. The only problem I had with this is the strap that holds the oroborus. After adjusting it a few times, the slip - knot closed and is extraordinarily difficult to re-size afterwards. <end>  Nice detail  Great pendant! Nice intricate detail, the detail is on both sides. The item shipped fast. Black cord with the pendant and nice pouch for the pendant; but the nice thing is that the cord you can adjust the length. <end>

 B00064UTD8  Regal Royalty King Dragon Real Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Amazing Dragon-ness!  I got this pendant last year, and I LOVE it. I wear it multiple times a week and always get compliments on it. It's a nice size and I love the simple black cord it comes on. I highly recommend. It's great quality w/ nice details. I'm definitely going to shop this jeweler again. <end>
 B00064UTFG  Jewish Star Of David Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Poorly made  It broke the star from the piece that holds the string after only 24 hours. It arrived on time and looked very nice but the total quality was weak and soft so it would not hold up to wear. <end>  Very nice...but not very wearable.  This is a nice pendant. It comes with a black rope cord necklace that is adjustable which is also very nice...but it is bigger than I expected. The only other disappointing thing is it is completely flat on one side so it doesn't lay against you well and when it flips it looks funny.The front is very nicely detailed and a nice sort of brushed metal pewter/silver. It is a nice piece to hang on the wall, but maybe not around your neck.It came in a very nice dark blue velvet bag as well. <end>  not as shiny  the picture shows a bright shiny star of David right? Well it so is not the case. It does not even look like silver! <end>  Beautiful Star of David  I was delighted with this beautiful Star of David. Yes, with effort it can be manually twisted and deformed (it is pewter, after all), but it has been durable enough for routine wearing by an adult male. Mine has not broken in six months of use. <end>  Disappointed  This picture makes it look better than what it looks in person. Its darker (I guess antiquing is what its suppose to be?) Definitely for A man. <end>  Thank you or your reviews  While the pendant does have a nice, unique look that we were looking for for my daughter's boyfriend, I am remeinded after reading your reviews why we shouldn't stray from stronger metals for jewelry. Thank you for preventing me from making a mistake. <end>  HUGE  the star was huge i thought it was going to be a necklace but the star was more of a big keychain. <end>  perfect  My son recently converted his religion and I bought this to support his change. He loves it and wears it proudly. He likes the fact that it's not "dainty", but suits a man. <end>  Great product and fast delivery  This is a great product. The delivery was quick. Great to work withthis company! <end>
 B00064UTHY  Holy Egyptian Cat Statue Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  egyptian cat necklace  Very nice quality item. It arrived in a package from Thailand and we were so excited. The shipper included a postcard from Thailand too! My daughter loves it and wears it constantly. <end>  Daughter loved it  The necklace is great. My daughter had one a few years ago and lost it. She loves it and wears it everyday. <end>
 B00064UTJM  Noose Dead Hanging Skeleton Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  This necklace is absolutely amazing.  There is something about nooses and skeletons that just take my breath away so when I saw this necklace on Amazon I was so happy. It is a great price and the deliver fast. The necklace is perfect, there are no flaws in it whatsoever and I am very excited to purchase more products from these guys. You will not be disappointed. <end>  Pendant Review  The pendant necklace was perfect. It looked exactly like the picture/description and arrived very fast. I plan to use this seller's store many times in the near future. <end>  its about to snap in half  i love this pendant, but its very fragile and it feels like its about to just crumble to pieces if touched. im afraid to wear it, and afraid to touch it. <end>  ..  I bought mine a few years ago, and I've loved it every moment I've owned it. The cord is surprisingly nice (not some skimpy bit of nylon), but I did eventually replace it with one I made so it would be longer and easier to tuck away at akward times. It's an ideal gift for self-identifying villains and victims alike. <end>  He's Adorable!  I bought this for my son's birthday.I can't wait to see what he thinks.But I think he's great!Fast ship and his own little pouch. <end>
 B00064UTVA  Light Comfortable Celtic Trinity Pewter Bracelet ||	  Looks better in picture than in real life.  This bracelet looks better in the picture than it actually is. I thought it was going to be silver but it is more putty colored and of very rough quality. I probably won't wear it. <end>  Not so much.  I don't mind that it doesn't look like fine jewelry. I wasn't expecting it to for the price. But the fastener is like an open hook that doesn't close and it doesn't lay nicely on the wrist. I have it hanging in my window as an ornament, but won't try to wear it. <end>  Cheap quality. Don't plan to ever wear it.  Doesn't even have a clasp--it links by an S hook. No great loss if it fell off, though. <end>  Attractive but needs different clasp  The bracelet was even nicer looking than its picture. The only problem is that the fastening is not good and the bracelet falls off easily. It had to be attacked with a pair of pliers and permanently closed. Luckily it was big enough to fit over the hand without the clasp having to come undone. <end>  disapointed  I wish I would have read the reviews befor I ordered this item, Not happy with it at all,does not look like the photo.Was a waist of money and will never wear it. <end>  Nice but not quite what I expected  It is a nice bracelet but has more of a plastic feel then pewter, also it is not as silver toned as it appears in the picture. <end>
 B00064UU1Y  Hypnotic Spiral Shell Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Really, a ten-star item!  Of all the wonderful pieces I have found at Dan's Jeweler's, this is my favorite! It is crafted in the shape of the koru, which is inspired by the uncurling fern fond commonly found in New Zealand. The koru represents peace, tranquility, personal growth, positive change, and awakening, and has been traditionally worn by Maori people to signify wew life, new beginnings, and harmony. Dan's rendition of this shape is beautiful in its balance and finish. <end>  Spiral Pendant  Love the design.However, mine had several noticeable imperfections. I don't mind, gives it a somewhat "grungy" look. Just keep it in mind.Also, I love the nifty adjustable cord that comes with it.Rating  4 stars (I would rate it 4,5 if rating system allowed me) <end>  Pewter Spiral Shell necklace  This is a very nice necklace. I don't like the cord it came on because the knots fall right to the side of my neck and show. I am planning on buying a different cord to hang it from. Otherwise, I liked this item and will wear it often. <end>  Gets the compliments  I thought I would like the other designs I ordered from this seller the best and got this as an afterthought but it looks the best on with many types of outfits. And many people have noticed it and complimented me on it - it is a simple spiral but just, well, very nice. <end>  Fine jewerly craftmanship  Upon receiving the Spirel Pendant - it has fast become one of my favorite pieces of jewerly to wear. I receive many compliments on the piece and in fact one friend asked me "why didn't you purchase one for me!". Ordering from this vendor was easy and fast. I received the necklace in record time. Thanks Amazon.com for offering this piece.- chris. <end>  Beautiful!  I read other's reviews prior to purchasing and have to agree - this is an amazing piece, especially given the reasonable price point. I'm very happy with the necklace and have received a lot of compliments on it. My only (admittedly picky) issue is that the string it comes on is a bit rough. I love that it has adjustable knots so you can decide on the length that's best for you but if you have sensitive skin you may want to trade the string out for satin cord. <end>  I like it  The necklace is really pretty and a good size but the cord is kinda thin and I'm scared that if I have it on while I'm asleep the cord will snap. other than that it is one of my favorites. <end>  Love this!  I love this item, wear it often, and am constantly complimented on it.It's casual, yet interesting and exactly what I like. <end>  Great simple necklace  I put down a 2 star for review by accident. I actually really like it. It was a mistake. I give it 5 stars <end>  very nice  Got this as a gift for a swirl collector, and you really cant go wrong with this.one. The price is right and its very cute and made sturdy. Will go with many looks, cords/chains. Would recommend! <end>  lots of compliments  I really loved this when it came and found people seeing it loved it too. <end>
 B00064UU82  Winged Unicorns Knight Crest Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Very nice...  I really like it. It looks just like the picture but suprisingly lighter than I thought. It is very lovely.It's great! <end>
 B00064UU9G  Blue King Crown Tooth Pewter Necklace ||	  Neat little piece, but only from the front.  I like it, I got it as a part of a Halloween costume and overall I'm pretty happy with the item for that purpose, but I didn't notice from the picture that it was one sided, hollow in the back, so that may be an issue for some people looking to buy this.Overall not bad though, I'll probably buy more pieces from this seller. <end>
 B00064UUBE  Gay Pride Rainbow Flag Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Necklace Review  I bought this necklace because it was just enough to show off my pride. It wasn't screaming to the public my sexual preference, and I liked that. My only issue with the pendant is that the cord came untied within the first day, and I have to keep tightening the knots to prevent the necklace from slipping off my neck. Other than that small inconvenience, the product is great. I actually bought a second one to give to my boyfriend. <end>  Cute "little" necklace  This necklace is a very nice item for someone who is wanting to discreatly wear their pride without flashing the cliche rainbow. I like it because it's very different and has a simple design. The only flaw I have seen is that it is smaller in size than it appears in the photo -- its only about an inch or inch and a half long -- other than that, it's really nice. <end>  Love it  I ordered this to show a little bit of pride without being a walking rainbow. I LOVE it and I get many complements on it. <end>  Excellent Quality  I love this pendant. Purchased one for myself and another for a gift. It has a nice weight/thickness, the colors are bright and can be worn any length. <end>  Wonderful!  This is a wonderful piece of jewelry! It looks really great and it has some nice things like the adjustable string. I really love this product - its very stylish and even a little discrete. I only gave this 4 stars because of one major issue  wear. I've only had this for about a month and there are way too many scratches on it - and they change the texture of it and makes it look bad. I've only had it on for really general usage - nothing that should have scratched it so it isn't the most durable. As for other's saying the string comes loose, that has not been a problem for me. Also, just to note, the picture looks like the pendant is beveled out (looks like its bulging out) when in reality, its beveled slightly in. Also, the metal is a brushed metal, not a solid color metal. But don't worry, I think it looks better than its picture! <end>  Great pendant  I got the product in really fast despite my shipping method choosen the necklace has little slip knots that makes it easy to change were you want it to be at so its very ajustable the colors are magnificant and not too bright and it is small enough that it dosnt weigh your head down and it comes with a little case/bage that you can just pull the stings up as well to put your necklace in it it is a truely grand item and I would buy it again <end>  Subtle and Classy  Good quality. The necklace is easily adjustable which makes for great customization  it can be worn at dog-tag length or as a choker. Plus, donning and removing is simple, over-the-head... there's no fumbling around with clasps. I find it to be just the right volume for everyday pride. I can wear it anywhere without feeling out of place, yet it still gets the message across. Overall, I love this product. <end>  ok...but a small problem  I wore it, and one of the ends came apart, but I retied it. Not much of an issue...overall, I'd buy from them again <end>  great  this was better than i thought it would be i got lots of compliments for it. <end>
 B00064UUGY  Hip Hop Robot Dancer Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Too cute  This is such a cute piece. I was surprised at how heavy it was, but just love it.Fun piece to wear to dance class. <end>  Broke  My 9 year old daughter loved the design, but the arms broke off within a week.Great looking but not durable enough for kids. <end>  Nice but fragile  Purchased this necklace for my 12 year old son. it lasted maybe a week before it broke at the neck.Definitely should not be worn by active children. Necklace was nice with good detail. Should have been made in a heavier metal to last longer. <end>
 B00064UUIW  Labyrinth Maze Amulet Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Nice look  This product has a good look about it. It adds a bit of flavor to whatever I happen to be wearing. Just as well, the pewter has a nice feel to it. This usually is important to me since some metal's textures can irritate my skin.Also the cord has a nice sizing aspect, so you can wear it low on your chest, or tighten the cord so it sits just between your collar bones.Very nice amulet. <end>
 B000659OFQ  14k Yellow Gold Anklet w/ Heart Charms, 9.5" ||	  First Time Purchase  I am very impressed with the quality of the merchandise as well as the service I received. Due to being a new buyer online I was very skeptical but, I am enjoying my purchase. Thank You <end>  like it  I lost one of the hearts the first day, probably my own fault. I wore it under socks to work, and pulled the socks off and with it came a heart. It is cute. Nice color gold. I kept it even with the heart off since I have the heart I could have it put back on. It still looks cute with out it. <end>
 B000659OIS  14k White Gold Rope Bracelet w/ Heart Toggle, 7.25" ||	  Picture is larger then it may appear.  After our dog ate my mothers day bracelet, my husband offered to replace it. I decided to go simpler and choose this braclet.Now keep in mind that most of the jewelry pictures is no where near as large as it is pictures. This bracelet is delicate and rather light. The toggle clasp is not the best, as it fell off of my wrist several times. I had to take it to the jeweler to have a lobster claw clasp put on in it's place.I can't complain- it is a pretty, simple bracelet. But the clasp is just terrible. <end>  size  It wasn`t big enough for me. But was well worth the money. Good quality, & I wish it fit. Thankyou Willa <end>  Beautiful But Fragile  I bought this item for my girlfriend. It's been one of her favorites gifts she's gotten. Some bad notes about it is that it tends to fall off the wrist because the clamp is not totally secure. After a couple of weeks, the rope broke from the heart. Now it has to be fixed and safely secure it.Overall, the bracelet is a wonderful gift for its beauty but very fragile. Can break or fall off. Beware....2 months later.....she didn't know it, but it came loose and now....lost.But still would purchase it but send it to be fixed. <end>
 B000659OLA  14k Yellow Gold Fancy Hoop Earrings ||	  Beautiful Earrings  I bought these as a gift and could not have been more pleased with them. The detail work on the beaded chain wraparound on the hoop is well done and adds a nice quality. Amazon packaged them very nicely, sending along a care guide and warranty information. Check these out - you won't be disappointed. <end>
 B000659OLU  14k Yellow Gold Double Link Charm Bracelet, 7" ||	  Pretty but petite  This is a very pretty bracelet. It was a little smaller then I believed it was and it was a gift for a friend who is not exactly small. I would purchase it for myself, but I would've liked a width measurement. Overall a good bracelet for a good price. <end>  If I could give less than 1 star I would  I ordered one for my sister and it arrived with one link missing in one place and another link dangling in another place. I immediately returned it for a refund. Thankfully I got everything back. This bracelet is really flimsy and not worth the $99 price tag. Save yourself the headache with this one and get a different bracelet. <end>  Not what I Wanted  Returned it as soon as I saw it. Not at all what I thought it was going to be. Good thing I had a fallback plan. Amazon was wonderful though with the return!! Great company that stands behind their orders to make things right when they don't work out for the customer! <end>  Gold bracelet  Beautiful 14 kt gold double link bracelet. Any women would enjoy and would make a wonderful self purchase or gift. <end>  Great add on  I wear this alone many times however it is a great layering piece. Easy to wear does not get in the way. The cut is nice Not to thin. Nicely done. <end>
 B000659OUQ  Children's Freshwater Cultured Pearl 4.0-4.5mm Necklace, 13" and Bracelet, 5" 14k Yellow Gold Set ||	  Children's freshwater pearl necklace/bracelet  The pearl necklace and bracelet were well crafted. The pearls were well matched. The packaging was beautiful. Sent as a christening gift and was very well received. <end>
 B00065FYQE  Jewish Star Of David Skull Skulls Pewter Pendant ||	  star od david  it's amazing!!!it's smaller than i expected. i wear mine proudly every day. you wont reget buying this.i get a lot of compliments at work. <end>  Awesome!  This is the best necklace. I could never decide if I wanted to wear skulls or the Jewish star and now I can wear both. I'm very happy with it. I took off the black string and put on a silver metal clasp chain just because the black thing was kind of annoying to tighten and get off. Still, this is the best necklace I have ever gotten. The skulls are a perfect size to be noticed but not be too overwhelming. I recommend this to every Jewish person who likes skulls. (I wonder how many of us there are in the world.) <end>  Perfect for Jewish goths  I ordered this Star Of David with skulls on it because of 2 reasons. 1  I'm of Jewish decent and 2  I'm a goth. Thus both my Jewish heritage and gothic lifestyle are both satisfied. The skulls on the Star Of David are subtle so as not to insult the Jewish faith. The pewter material really adds a nice finish and look to the design. It is extemely rare to find any Jewish iconogrphy in gothic jewelry. I dare say that every Jewish goth should go out and buy this necklace and wear it with pride and style. <end>  Darkly satsifying!  If you're like me, you are absolutely tired of the endless Christian symbolism (even though most of it is used to mock or parody Christian symbolism) in the Goth subculture that we inhabit. Thankfully this jeweler came through for us and made a wonderful pendant that shows both our dark nature and also our Jewish heritage.The pendant is well designed and sturdy, the rope that holds it up is creative with the two knots to tighten the necklace around your neck, though it can be frustrating if you realize suddenly you put it on the wrong way after tightening the knots! It does feel a little heavy, but really that's what you want when you want it to hold close to your chest and not have the pendant move around too much.I am hoping (though it is a more expensive hope!) for this design to made into a silver piece with a silver chain one day. Otherwise, it is probably the best Jewish Goth jewelery piece I have seen yet. <end>  gift  I love this item. I was only surprized by the shortness of the cord attached. But this was nothing I couldn't work with. <end>
 B00065FZE0  No War Peace Protest Stop Fight Pewter Ring ||	  Cheap metal.  (  I wore this ring for a day and it looked like it had been through Vietnam. It fit well and looked awesome at first. The scuffs and dents are a little too distracting. <end>  Great Buy!  I have a small finger so the letters turn a bit and it's kind of hard to read...but I don't mind because it's such a cool statement ring. It's definitely BIG! Fits great and doesn't look cheap. <end>  very nice  the product came very fast and was just like how amazon explained itthe ring is very clearly written NO WAR and thick which i likebut i guess if you like small rings this isnt your ring <end>
 B00065FZEK  Hare Trinity Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  HARE TRINITY PENDANT  This is a lovely little pendant. Not too big or too small. And its double sided, which is an added good feature. <end>  Just ok  Product was much smaller than i thought it would be.Product was over boffed to the point that much of the Detail was lost. <end>  Beautiful Necklace  Since I had always loved rabbits, I decided that I wanted to buy a rabbit necklace. So I was searching among the jewelry portion of Amazon and I cam across this beautifully crafted and I was not disappointed with this product! I got it for a great price and its definitely worth the purchase. The rabbits are very adorable and sculpted well and clear on the pendant. You also receive a black cord that comes with it. I was surprised at that. I thought it was just the pendant that I bought. It looks a lot bigger than the picture and a bit thinner. But its a purchase worth buying. Don't hesitate when buying this, just do it! <end>  Cute Piece  I bought this pendant because of the celtic style and rabbits. It's well made and it looks interesting. It's exactly what I expected and I wasn't disappointed. If you have any doubts about buying this pendant, dont! <end>  Gorgeous necklace, slow shipping  I was pretty excited for this particular purchase, but disappointed it took like two days for it to ship after I'd ordered it.The product itself wears quite nicely, and I have worn it since I've gotten it. <end>
 B00065FZM2  Ugly 2 Skulls Skull Heads Head Spine Pewter Ring, Size 8 ||	  Lovely  this bracelet always brightens up my day and makes me want 2 sing. every ghost spirit i see compliments this braclet. ever since i bought this braclet and put it on i feel like smashing peoples heads against brick walls. sometimes i even have the urge 2 beat myself up in public places with a light saber. and 1 time while wearing the braclet a man came up 2 me & speared me with a tridentgood times, good times <end>
 B00065FZXG  Cowboy Horse Saddle Pewter Finger Armor Ring ||	  size  It's a great looking ring, and there was no problem with the sipping; but the size is the issue. There was no place to pick a size, but nowhere else did it say the size of the ring. So for future buyers be aware of that...the ring I have is about a size 10. <end>  Cowboy Horse Saddle Silver Tone Pewter Finger Armor Ring  The ring was exactly as pictured, nice and heavy. It was delivered promptly, much more quickly than I had expected. As it turned out, I couldn't use it (I'm a 5-foot female). I had thought that maybe I could wear it on my first or second finger, but it was way too big. Still, it was too nice to return so I passed it on to a friend. <end>  Close but not quite  The Quality was right up there but I had no idea of the size and it ended up being way to large, have big hands for a female and it was really loose even on my thumb <end>  Excellent  It fits my index finger perfectly. I have gotten many compliments on it and I have yet to see anyone else with one like it. I have worn it with all types of dress clothing and it really stands out as unique and decorative. <end>  Cowboy horse ring  I love my ring. It goes with everything. It came to me on time. The service was awesome. Could not ask for anything better. Thank you. <end>  Not worth the money.  This ring was bulky and didn't fit correctly. Wasn't made well, very large, size 12 or 13. <end>
 B00065G080  Grinning Lucky Powerful Dragon Pewter Ring ||	  powerful statement  this ring is not as shiny as the picture provided;however,the quality is there.this a hefty piece of jewelry that will definitely get noticed on your finger.i have gotten many comments from people,when i wear it.the only bad thing is the dragon ears are sharp and catch on everything.if your looking for an unsual piece of jewelry,that will last a lifetime this is it,and the price makes it a steal. <end>  very large dragon  i only gave this four stars because the horns catch on everything. The ring is very attractive and bright. It is a heavy ring. I was able to bend the horns into a position so that they dont catch on everything. nice ring <end>  Nice... But  Nice ring good quality piece feels heavy not flimsy, for the price, but it lost its shine and luster 3 days out the package. <end>  Sturdy ring  Gave this ring as a gift. The recipient liked it a lot. 2 things though, the horns are quite sharp, and it would be nice if the ring had more size options. Other than that, if you like what you see, that is what you get! <end>
 B00065G0C6  Celtic Yin Yang Design Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Creative, Awesome and Exactly What I Was Looking For  This is great piece. Wear it constantly. The Celtic spin on the yin yang design is perfect (I was looking for somthing unique as opposed to the traditional yin yang. Wanted something a little "old world")...And this is it. Seller got it to me in great condition and very quickly. Thumbs up on quality and service! <end>  Nice piece for the price  Very happy with the looks and size of the pendant. Looks expensive. Comes with a black fabric cord. Nice product. <end>  Celtic yin yang pewter pendant necklace  I really like the pendant. It goes with a couple scrub tops I wear to work. <end>  Cheap Jewelry  I liked the design on this but the necklace broke after a few weeks and the pendant itself turns a darkish color after a while, maybe it is oxidizing.. I don't know. Its just kinda cheap I guess. <end>  So so  Pendant size is larger than a quater making it a bit gaudy. The leather cord it comes with would probably not fit over the head of most children, so it's useless. <end>
 B00065G0H6  Circled Triangle Circle Knot Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Adoption symbol  Not as high quality as it looks online. But still nice. Rope isn't highest quality either. But adoption symbol things are hard to find. <end>
 B00065G0OO  Celtic Design Axe Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  A Bit Bulky  I enjoyed the style of the pendant and chain but it is to bulky to wear causally. I'll wear it for occasions but it's not right for every day use. <end>
 B00065G0SA  Greek Christian Cross Real Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  I bought this as a gift and she was absolutely thrilled.  This piece of jewelry is so heavy, and well as beautifully designed, but the weight of it is what makes it seem so fine and expensive. My daughter had it on her wish list so she knew she'd like it to start with, but she was even more thrilled when she actually had it in her hand--and around her neck! The adjustable-length cord makes it even more desirable. And the seller sent a 20% off coupon for the next purchase! <end>
 B00065G0SU  Maltese Cross Celtic Irish Pewter Bracelet ||	  Lovely braclet  I recent had gotten this for a birthday present. Since it will fit to the size of your wrist, great is you have skinny wrists when most bracelets won't fit. however I do not recommend wearing this when moving boxs etc as I lost my first one when having a lawn sale. I did however order another because I liked the first one so much. <end>  MALTESE CROSS Celtic Irish Silver Tone PEWTER BRACELET  Bracelet is very nice. Overseas delivery was very prompt. I'm very happy with the service I received <end>  too narrow for me  i bought several for gifts and this one was too thin. This is the only one that we didn't like <end>
 B00065G0UI  Anarchy Rocking Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  anarchy neckless  Great quality. Like the adjustability of the neckless length. Quick shipping.And they did all this because it was in their best interest; no one had to make them. <end>  Cool Neclace. Dosent look too cheap.  Great. About the same or better quality of jewlry you would find at a Fair or Headshop. Happy with product. <end>
 B00065G0XU  Celtic Bird Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Heavy  This pendant is very pretty and has all of the details shown in the picture. I especially like the black cord on which the pendant hangs because it is adjustable, so I can wear it with many outfits. However, the pendant is VERY heavy, which is never mentioned. If I had known how heavy it was, I would have thought twice about buying it. <end>
 B00065G0ZI  Chinese Horse Symbol Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Chinese Horse Pewer Pendant Necklace  Nice pendant, nice leather holder. Fast delivery, safely packaged. Glad i ordered it. Dan's Jewelry did a very nice job. <end>  Perfect!  The pendant was the perfect size with an adjustable cord which I loved. Thanks Dan! <end>  More than I expected  This Pewter symbol necklace on a black cord was even better in person than in the picture. The cord is adjustable so it goes with many outfits. I've received many compliments on the jewelry. Would definately purchase another item from this vendor. Arrived within stated time as well. <end>  Well worth the price  This genuine pewter pendant came with a adjustable black rope necklace in a pretty velvet bag. It was shipped directly from Taiwan (we kept the mailing envelope just for the address and stamp) and included a lovely postcard of Taiwan. All of it including the packaging was quite a keepsake for my daughter. <end>  Better than the picture!  I purchased this necklace for my 13 year old niece who loves horses.We had an early Christmas gathering and gave her this necklace. She LOVES it!The necklace looks even better in person.Thanks Dan! <end>  Pretty nice  I loved the sign part of the necklace but I think they should have used a chain instead of a rope. Other than that, it was very nice (it would be very simple to change to a chain anyway). To be straightforward, it was simple, but meaningful. I liked it. <end>
 B00065G12A  Chinese Lucky Dragon Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Lots of compliments  I bought one of these for myself (Tiger symbol-also by Dan Jeweler) and got lots of compliments on it. A friend liked it so for her birthday I bought her the Dragon version. she is also very happy with it. It is pewter rather than silver and very light in weight, but I don't mind that because if it were heavier it wouldn't hang as well on a chain. It comes with a cord that is little more than thick black string. You will probably do what I did and cut it off the string. I bought the "Sterling Silver Snake 1.4mm Chain Necklace 20" and it is a really nice balance for the modern look of the pendant. <end>
 B00065G12U  Celtic Knot Pattern Druid Irish Pewter Bracelet ||	  Sleek Celtic Bracelet  Like this bracelet a lot. Really looks good when you're going to work, out with friends, wherever. I love it! Have to be a bit careful as pewter is a softer metal than sterling or stainless.Celtic Knot Pattern Druid Irish Pewter Bracelet <end>  Very dissapointed  The product is very cheaply made and with the slightest pressure bends all out of shape. I would not recommend purchasing this at all. <end>
 B00065G14I  Chinese Dog Character Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  sastified  I purchased this necklace for my teenage son and he really liked it. The necklace was good quality for the price. We were definitely satisfied with the purchase. <end>  Very Nice  The necklace was exactly as illustrated. I've received many compliments. <end>
 B00065G17K  Oroborus Universe Amulet Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Results  Though the upper part of the Ouroboros face was messed up to a visible point (being the only upsetting part because it cheapened it), overall, the general detail of the pendant was alright. It surprised me that the size of the pendant was that of a quarter (take or add), which I actually liked, because I couldn't imagine wearing a huge thing. Delivery was very quick and the packaging was professionally done. <end>
 B00065G17U  King Arthur Sword White Crystal Pewter Pendant ||	  soft metal  The hilt is beautiful and well done but the sword itself is soft pewter and bends so easily I'm afraid it will break off. I was hoping for a necklace that I could wear all the time, but this one is so soft I don't dare sleep in it. It is very fragile. <end>  Very Nice  Arrived very promptly and was much nicer than what was shown on the website. Will order from this vendor again! <end>
 B00065G1FW  Blue Crystal Star Of David Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Exceeded expectation, prettier than it looks  Unbelievable price for this beautiful Jewish Star with the Blue Crystal in the middle.Great quality.My 11 year old son was thrilled. Now I am looking to order a similar one for me !!Jon <end>  blue crystal Star of David pewter pendant necklace  This necklace looks beautiful online but is cheaply made--the pewter is very, very thin and the blue stone looks like a cheap piece of plastic. I previously purchased another pewter Star of David necklace and am very happy with it; however, this piece was definitely a HUGE disappointment! I would advise against buying this particular necklace. <end>
 B00065G1Q6  Claws Spikes Pewter Finger Armor Ring Spike ||	  Stunning piece of work  a truly amazing piece of work, it was great to watch my son qwivering with exitment and joy upon opening the gift. Of note if you want to bring this product into australia one needs to fill in customs forms and get 'permission to import weapons other than fire arms' filled in by the firearms branch of the state police. I don't quite see how they could be used as weapons. it is a very beautiful peice of jewellry <end>  for all the ones who buy in the future  The item does not have a full ring to it, so it is adjustable. The item comes built so tight that the prices barely move. This is ok. Let me reassure you, the prices can be coaxed to move if you slowly flex them. This is done so the wearer can adjust the ring to the desired flexibility. The ring part that is supposed to mold around the fingertip is also adjustable and can be adjusted by hand. First rate and you should know, very heavy. <end>  Disappointing  Ordered this one along with another, and this was the more sturdy of the two. The other broke withing 10 minutes of opening the package. This one is still fine, but I'm shelving both. This one is very uncomfortable, and does not bend easily. <end>  Cool looking ring  I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday 3 and a half years ago and it arrived fine. People were impressed at seeing this ring, it looks pretty awesome and a little intimidating I guess for people who aren't use to seeing them worn. Within the first year the bolts started coming loose, so I brought it to my jewelry teacher back when I was still in high school and he put new bolts in and it fit much better! More snug and moveable. It's worth a buy but don't expect it to last forever if you wear it often, you should get new bolts put in place when they get loose.But I can't buy any more of this from Dan's jewelry, as it says it won't ship here, I don't know why as I bought two finger length rings from here before.Oh since I bought it for my boyfriend the ring fits fine but if you're a woman, it might be big to wear-it was a tiny bit loose on him, I'm not sure what size he wears. Also the picture looks bright but the metal is much darker than the picture, but still nice looking. <end>  total garbage  This item is poorly crafted and the pics are misleading. I dont collect claws for display, i actually wear them in everyday life. This product is not wearable nor does it bend for show. Those of you who collect might find this very under par for your collection.Claws Spikes Pewter Finger Armor Ring Spike <end>  Failure and disappointment  I decided that I wanted something that would go well with my personality, so I decided I would buy one of these and try it out. When I received it, I was amazed. The craftsmanship and overall design were beautiful, and I thought that this would be it. The one thing to bring my chaotic nature to the forefront. With about two months, either the hinges or the hinge holes had broken completely leaving only the base and finger piece intake to a usable point. Then to make matters worse, the base has a slowly evolving crack in it, making adjustment to size impossible with out completely breaking it to pieces. and the fingertip is also beginning to develop a crack in it.Overall, while being initially impressed by the craftsmanship and design, this was an overall fail. I am sorely disappointed in this product and will not be buying and of Dan's Jewelers other products. This is a disappointment and, to be honest, an embarrassment. <end>  crap  this was complete and total crap. i've never been so disappointed in a purchase in my life. i would've rather recieved flaming dung than this. it was bad quality, would only fit on the finger of a fat giant, and didn't even bend properly. if u buy it, you're a complete fool. <end>
 B00065G1W0  Lucky 13 Horseshoe Good Luck Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Charmed  I'm very pleased with this pendant.Used it for a necklace for a while thenhung it on my rearview mirror. <end>
 B00065H10G  Wolf Wolves Werewolf Were Dog Pewter Bracelet ||	  LOVE this bracelet  This bracelet is beautiful! I love wolves and this is just what I wanted. The detail of the wolf is perfect and I love the cuff style. I would defently recommend this bracelet for anyone who loves wolves. Beautiful craftsmanship! The pewter does bend easily but the detail and crafts-ship of the wolf is worth the carefulness you have to take in bend the bracelet on and off. <end>  Great Wolf Bracelet  I love this bracelet! It is absolutly beautiful. The wolf is awesome looking and has great detail. I really love this bracelet and I plan to wear it a lot and show it off. <end>  4 items ordered; 3 going back  Wolf Dream Catcher is actually smaller than pictured. While it is nice, one must look closely to figure out what the medallion actually is. Light but sturdy. The beaded adornments slide along the cord freely and with some work on your part, it might hang at its longest nicely.However, the cord is quite thin and disappointing and seems to be permanently curled from packaging and shipping position. No matter what I do, I cannot seem to straighten the cord so it hangs evenly. There are several twists and curls in it that make it look dumb. Although it is adjustable by a simple pull-the-knot-through-the-loop closesure, it doesn't stay where you put it. The slightest movement and it drops back to its longest.This would be much nicer on a chain that hangs appropriately. However, the openings in the adornment beads is so small, I doubt purchasing a separate chain would work. While the chain might fit through the beading and the bail for the medallion itself, I have yet to figure out how to get the loop at the beginning of the chain (that the lock attaches to) through the beads to begin the threading process. Don't think there is a chain out there small enough to fit yet strong enough to hold. Now, if one wanted to remove the loop for the closure on a chain, thread the chain through the beads and medallion and then reattach the closure loop, I am sure that would work. I just don't want to go through all that work. This is going back.p.s. I also purchased, at the same time, the Wolf Tooth necklace. Same holds true for that one. And in the picture online, the wolf's head appears to have varied colors on it distinguishing it from the 'tooth'. However, mine is all the same color so, once again, unless one looks closely, it is difficult to determine what the medallion actually is. The cord is the same as above. This one is also going back.The Wolf Earrings, on the other hand, while small, are great. Sturdy post that doesn't seem as if it will bend easily. These are very small so look best as a second piercing adornment, but can be worn alone for a more subdued look.The Wolf Cuff bracelet is nice, and looks much sturdier than it is. The first time I put it on and tried to gently bend the sides to fit my wrist better as one must do with most cuffs, the section where the wolf is attached got 'bend marks' in it. So now the cuff looks like a 3-sided box - actual bend marks showing top and both sides. I'll keep it because I bent it but doubt I'll wear it often. <end>  Stunning  This is one of my favourite pieces of jewellery. It's beautiful, a great talking piece and extremely comfortable to wear. <end>  Wow  So I bought the bracelet about a week ago and it was delivered extremely fast and I got a few others things to, and thier all fantastic, really well crafted, just make sure not to resize the bracelet too often of it could break. <end>  The picture does this justice not!  This is a wonderful piece. Others say it is easily bendable but its nothing compared to the other metal banded bracelets I have purchased. If your thinking about buying it stop hesitating! <end>  pewter bracelet  i love my bracelet, I wear it everyday. I like the old world look about it. The only drawback is the fact that pewter is a soft metal,& bends easily. I have to be careful not to push it too tight on my wrist. Love my wolf bracelet. <end>  I'm guessing its because its Pewter  I don't really like the quality of it. When you start to bend it around your wrist you can hear it almost crackling. I'm guessing this is because its Pewter which I'm not familiar with but I'm sure I wont purchase anything Pewter again. It looks like it would be a nice weight and feel but it just feels thin and brittle, when you bend it you can sort of see it get bubbled cracks(thats the best way I can describe it). I thought from the previous reviews that I would like it.. But I don't. It's a 50/50 product I guess. All in all, I'm dissapointed and I know I won't be wearing it anytime soon. <end>  The Broken Bracelet  The look of the bracelet was exactly like the picture. It looked great on my wrist and for a month of wearing maybe 3 times a week. it broke. The metal broke right at the tail of the wolf. Maybe it is a weak spot at the wield, but I was shocked that it broke so easily. I liked the look and feel, but duribility is a big question. I would not buy this item again. <end>  Wolf totem  I wasn't that familiar with pewter jewelry until I purchased this and the Trinity knot bracelet from Dan's Jewelers. Both are much nicer than pictured!! Not being a "frilly" woman, I love the simple, yet somewhat detailed design, and I'm elated to have one of my totem animals on such a striking piece of jewelry. <end>  It suxs  I just hate this product and ill tell u why. For starters its to flimsy it bends way to easly. After a few days from having it it stareted to get a hair line crack right next to the wolf. I wore it to dinner with my husband and it got snaged on my purse when i was geting something out and it just bent all the way back and snaped off. This pruduct suxs and im glad they arnt selling this awfull thing no more. I would not recomend it to no one. and yes this product does have a beautifull wolf on it but its just not a good sturdy metal. <end>
 B00065LHJW  Sterling Silver August Birthstone Baby Brat Boy Pendant w/ Peridot Color Cubic Zirconia ||	  Small  The pendant is very small but is still cute. My wife's big complaint is that it was pictured with a chain and did not come with one. In the listing I see that but I'm only conveying the message. <end>
 B00065LHZG  Sterling Silver November Birthstone Baby Brat Boy Pendant w/ Citrine Color Cubic Zirconia ||	  Birthstone baby brat boy  I was very pleased at how fast I received this product and I am also very please at the quality of the product. If I find something I like again from this company I will order from them again. I highly recommend them to anyone who loves sterling silver . <end>
 B00066967Q  14k Rose Gold Tuscany Link Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Rose Gold Bracelet A+  This bracelet is exactly what I was hoping for  very light, pretty and totally wearable every day. I never take it off! <end>  lovely little bracelet  This isn't something you will run into anywhere else. Lovely contrast of textures, deep rose color, comfortable enough to wear all the time. It arrived in two days flat, too! <end>  Jury is Still Out  I won't dispute the other reviewers' comments about this bracelet being attractive. It is very nice looking. The one thing I was shocked about was how light this is. At first I thought this was rose colored plastic. Granted, it is stamped 14k and ITALY and everything is soldered, but the weight seriously made me question. They must be rolling these sheets out paper thin in order to make the links. So if you're looking for a bracelet with some weight, best keep looking. <end>
 B0006696AS  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Stud Earrings ||	  Very nice quality and great value  True, these studs are large and I was a little surprised when I opened the box and saw them for the first time because I didn't expect them to be so large, but I decided to keep them because they are very pretty. Despite the larger than average size, they have a beautiful color, faceting and setting. If you like a large stud, you will love! <end>  Not exactly subtle  I purchased these for my wife and immediately up on receiving them ran to the local jeweler and replaced them. They're certainly fine for what they are ... nice quality, inexpensive, and large, no humongous, nope - make that huge honking earrings. They're probably best suited to people with a genetic predisposition towards spectacularly sized heads and ears.The three stars are for quaility and value, not asthetics. <end>  Just Stunning!!!!!  I ordered these as a gift for someone. When they arrived, I was so pleased with them that I am contemplating keeping them for myself! They are just stunning! The sterling silver setting could fool anyone into white gold (as long you keep them clean) and the topaz stones are very large and remarkably cut. The topaz stones seem to be flawless. EXCELLENT quality Amazon! I will definitely be ordering jewelry through amazon.com again. <end>  These are monster size topaz stud earrings!!!  I purchased these to go with another pair of earrings. Little did I realize that the other reviewers were NOT exagerating. These suckers are huge and you do need the right type of face to be able to pull off wearing them.I really like them and I am sure they will go with a lot of stuff but I don't think I would purchase anything similar.Yes, the earrings are just that big.WOW!! <end>
 B0006696C6  14k Yellow Gold 4mm Diamond-cut Hoop Earrings ||	  Gold hoops  I was disappointed as to the size of the hoops. The picture was not actual size and the details only told the width not the diamiter of the hoop. I looked but could not find them. They are nice and were a good price, but in the future the diameter of the hoop would be be helpful. <end>
 B0006698AG  Sterling Silver Pink Mother-of-Pearl Heart Pendant ||	  Simply Sweet  My husband bought me this because he knows I like mother of pearl, and I collect silver jewelry, and my favorite color is pink. Can you say perfect?What do you expect for $15? Here's what you'll get with this  an 18" long sterling silver (Italian-made, I might add) snake chain and a pretty pendant with mother-of-pearl inlay.The pendant is not all perfectly pink; the colors play from beige to pink to lavander, depending on how the light hits each inlay. It's about 1" long and 3/4" across. (It's hard to be exact with the measurement because as you can see, it's not your typically symmetrical heart-shape.) The bail is big enough for a layered look, incase you want to put in more than one chain. The back is a solid smooth sterling silver surface, stamped 92.5.And the chain is NOT so thin that you'd have problems with it getting all knotted (if you've had really skinny chain necklaces, you know what I'm talking about). But you do have to be careful with the snake chain. If you're not carefull, you might permanently bend it, and this will affect its fluidity. <end>
 B0006698B0  Freshwater Cultured Pink Rice Pearl Pendant ||	  good deal for a beautiful necklace  First off, I just want to say that Amazon.com has the best service. I was qualified for the FREE standard shipping which usually takes about 3-9 business days, however I received this necklace in two days!Now the necklace. The necklace pictured is a bit more PINK than my necklace I received. Mine is more light light pink. Almost white pearlish. I was expecting the pearl to be more pink like shown in the picture, but it's okay I still like it. It comes in a beautiful velvet blue box with care instructions.This would make a really nice gift for someone! <end>  Mom Loved this pearl  Was a gift for my mom. She loves pink and didn't have a pink pearl. Looks quite nice on. <end>  beautiful color  The pink color is very nice. The pearl is quite big and the chain is kinda big too. It should be beautiful but somehow it looks slightly out of place with just about everything I tried....It doesn't look like dress jewlery, but then it doesn't look that well with casual attire either...I tend to think it is because of the chain. Anyways, it looks beautiful by itself! <end>  Very Good  I'm grateful I invested in this item. It is very beautiful and different in color. It has a good energy. <end>
 B00066IXP2  Sterling Silver Ivy Leaf Vine Branch Marcasite Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Careful With This One!  I love this ring, it is just as pictured and looks very elegant. The only caveat I have is that the shape and structure lend the ring to easy bends--I have already broken a couple soldered points. Also, I snag it on lots of things--clothes mainly--so I end up shelving the thing more than wearing it. But I am pretty rough on my hands, so if you aren't, this is a great ring for you. <end>  Nearly covers your whole finger! Nice and lean!  Silver Insanity has the best accessories!!! I saw the image of the ring on Amazon and immediately fell in love. I love rings that covers your proximal phalanx (the bone in your finger closest to your hand). When I received the ring, (earlier than counted upon), I was a little disappointed to see how little it looked and how dainty but that was before I tried it on. I was expecting the ring to be bulky and glad it wasn't. The fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx to the rings slimness. I recommend using the ring size chart b/c I had thought I'd be a 6; turns out, I'm a 7. What was misleading, though, is the picture. The leaves are shown bright, but it looks noticably darker (inside the outer rimming of the leaf, to where the gems are) when you have it in your hands. My fingers are long and slender. The ring didn't twist or turn about, but it didn't cover my proximal phalanx completely. I'll measure... from the end of the bottom leave to the end of the top, it's about 3.3cm. My middle proximal phalanx (the bone in your middle finger closest to your hand) is about 3.8cm. And if you should run your fingers through your hair, the leaves will not get entangled! Nice!You can wear the damn ring everywhere!!! I love it! <end>  Great product!  I love this ring. It is fun and it looks nice. I get compliments about it every time I wear it. <end>  Unique  Ring was nice, and unique. The points do snag on things though. And one of the "diamond" chips fell out but you can't really tell. <end>  Classy  Love the looks of this piece. Very classy and elegant, yet does not preak the bank. <end>  my favorite ring  The pictures don't do this ring any justice. It's a very pretty, unique ring. <end>  great ring!  I love this ring! I originally found it when I was reordering another vine ring from silver insanity. My boyfriend's mom gave me the vines and leaves ring which I also love, and I wore it at work too much (I'm a waitress) and a piece broke off. I went to amazon to order a replacement and found this ring. I ended up ordering both rings. I love this one because I can wear it at work and it has only caught on things a few times, and it was pretty easy to bend it right back into shape. The price was unbeatable and the quality of the ring was better than I expected. I have had so many complements on it, that I am going to order the matching earings!!! <end>  love the ring, but....  I love this ring, I really do. It's absolutely gorgeous. The only problem is that so far i have already lost three of the stones it in. It still looks ok, but losing those stones definately dissapointed me. I still wear it almost every day though. <end>  Worth it!  perfect pricing for this ring! Pretty! delivered quickly & in great condition! <end>
 B00066WFH4  10" Bead Anklet in 14K Two-Tone Gold ||	  Beautiful, but length a little misleading  This anklet is much more beautiful in person, than the extreme closeup shows. It is sturdy, yet dainty, and the white gold beads really sparkle. I would warn the buyer, however, that the 10" advertised length includes a one-inch length of weaker extender chain. The actual length of the sturdy beaded part is only 9". So, if you are wanting to wear it without ever taking it off, and you may want to measure your ankle before buying to decide if this is actually the anklet for you. <end>

 B00067PCJ6  Sterling Silver 5 mm High Dome Wedding Band Thumb Ring ||	  Great Shopping Experience  I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience with buying these rings. It was easy and convenient to order, and my shipment arrived so quickly that I was stunned. I am a very satisfied customer. <end>  High domed and attractive, drawbacks of silver hold it back  I purchased a Palladium ring elsewhere as my wedding band. I wanted something to wear when working with my hands, when damage to the ring is likely. I bought this, and a 5mm Stainless band. The stainless band is nicer for a few reasons. First, the silver color is beautiful but doesn't look like white gold/platinum/palladium, while the stainless looks very close. Second, the stainless is much more scratch resistant, this will scratch in the first five minutes you wear it. Third, the dome on this ring is very high which was uncomfortable for me. Fourth is that the silver is likely to react with some people's skin. I like the SS ring I also bought from Sabrina much better. If you want silver, this is it, but it wasn't what I expected. <end>  Exactly what I am looking for  I choose silver bcz it won't look gaudy and noble. Being a mortal, I prefer wearing sth plain but pure and clean. I am so happy to have found this ring. It is not shining and glaring. Rather, it looks gentle and elegant with nice shape. Once feeling "blurred" from the ring surface, just simply wear it and wash your hand with regular cleasing agent and it resumes its freshness!Every friend of mine who saw this tol me that I bought the right thing and it fits me perfectly! <end>  cherylg.  Nice ring. Arrived in nice sturdy package in a timly manner. Would recommend this company to anyone. <end>  nice looking ring  bought it for my gf, it is looking great and fit well. It is very good quality silver! <end>  delicate  The price was very good, it's a big sized ring but a little bit too much delicate... in few days not still shiny and with scratches (normal use! I didnt go to hike wearing it!!!) <end>  Great site  The rings I've ordered have all been beautiful. They have a nice tactile quality, good weight and finish. Thank you! <end>  great sterling silver ring  The ring arrived very fast and it was exactly what I ordered! Thank You very much! <end>

 B00067U58O  Amazon.com  Barb Wire Earrings  Clothing ||	  gift for an equestrian  My mom's favorite pair of earrings for years.

They are small enough to wear casually and are feminine despite the fact that they are barbed-wire. <end>
 B00067WMNU  PalmBeach Jewelry Genuine Shell Cameo Sterling Silver Antique-Finish Ring ||	  Lovely ring, but a little cheap looking  This ring is quite lovely, though it definitely has the "costume" jewelry look. It looks (as far as the cameo) a bit better in the picture than in real life. In reality, the cameo portion looks plastic and a little cheap compared to the rest of the ring. I enjoy wearing it though as I'm not overly concerned with it looking plastic. Have had a couple people comment on its look, as I haven't seen any like this at the department stores or other specialty stores locally. <end>  Cheaper on Palmbeach site  I purchased this ring a couple of years ago from Palm Beach Jewelry in Fl. and I must say it is a very pretty ring. It cost more on here! Personally, I would go straight to the horses mouth on this one. It is worth every penny I paid for it. I think palm beach offers free shipping or did! This could be a keepsake for a long time. The background in the ring is more tan than orange which is great, cornelian no matter if its shell, resin or whatever is orange and orange is NOT my fav.in colors. I make cameos(pendants) & I can see the quality and value in most. In my oppinion this is a very good ring for the price! <end>  Silver Cameo Ring  I purchased the Silver Cameo Ring from Palm Beach Jewelry for my wife as a Christmas gift. I must say she loves it! <end>  Stunning!!  My husband and son gave me this ring for Christmas. It is absolutely gorgeous. Very well made and beautiful on my finger. I LOVE it! <end>  love the mistake  I ordered this ring for my daughter, who is very petite. I thought I ordered a size 5 but received a size 10. OMG was my first reaction but then a dear dear friend came to mind and it was perfect. She is a bigger girl, 5ft. 10 in. and the ring looks beautiful and she is thrilled. <end>

 B00068ED72  Tommaso Design(tm) Clover Cut Genuine Garnet Earrings in 14 kt White Gold ||	  Tiny and Cheap Looking  I wasn't expecting much from these earrinigs, seeing that they are only 6mm. I don't know what they measured them with, but I only get 4mm. I've seen nicer looking earrings at gas stations! $100?? These are so small that you don't even notice the "Clover" cut. They just look like tiny little chunks of glass. <end>
 B00068I4MW  Swirling Dangle Earrings from the Artazia Collection #453 GE ||	  Artazia Earrings  They were absolutely beautiful. Basically, they are wearable art. I would highly recommend the product to everybody. Worth every penny. My mother loved them. <end>
 B00068I5PS  Treble Clef Pin from the Artazia Collection #457 GP ||	  Treble Clef Pin  I got this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. Her dad has passed away last year and he played the Celo, so a music note is very important and meaningful for her. It is beautiful in person. I love all of the pins made by Artazia. They are truely unique. <end>
 B00068IMBA  Pugster Edwardian Script Font Name Shay Italian Charms ||	  Great Gift  I have never, and I mean never, been able to find ready-made products with my child's name. This was a great gift for my 13-year old. <end>
 B00069CN5U  Sterling Silver Amethyst Poison Locket Ring Size 8(Sizes 5,5.5,7,8,8) ||	  Poison Ring  I highly reccomend this ring for any one who would like to keep a secret lock of hair from a loved one or a secret message or just a beautiful ring. It's quite beautiful and is the right size for someone with small hands or for a pinkie ring.The seller got it to me quite quickly. I give this purchase 5 stars! <end>
 B0006A66JI  Sterling Silver 8 mm Wedding Band Christian Fish Spinner Ring oxidized background 5/16 inch wide, ||	  Beautiful ring, excellent vendor  I purchased this ring along with three others from Sabrina Silver. Everything arrived very quickly (about three days after order). All four rings were ordered the same size but two were a little small. The exchange process went very smoothly. I have read other positive reviews about this vendor and I agree. Definitely a recommended vendor.Of the four rings I got this one is my favorite. It is nice and wide but doesn't feel heavy. I use it as a thumb ring and like wider rings for my thumb. I have fidgety hands so I like the spinner ring feature. I spin it with the fingers on the hand it is worn on as well as grabbing and spinning with my other hand. With other rings I find myself pulling the ring on and off. The only reason I gave this ring 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the seam in the spinner part. One fish is cut in half at the seam. On other rings I have the design is scaled to the ring. Since this is a hand made ring I am sure there is nothing that can be done about it but it still keeps the ring from being "perfect". <end>  are you an anxious Christian?  I just recieved this BEAUTIFUL ring in the mail. To my dismay, I ordered a size 13, thinking it would be great for my thumb. Sabrina Silver suggests that you get your finger sized at a jeweler, now I see why. I can wear this ring as a necklace!!!! I took advantage of Sabrina's one-time-only exchange policy and have re-packaged this prize for downsizing to a 9, (first finger or thumb). I am all atwitter with ANTICIPATION OF RECIEVING THIS GORGEOUS RING, in the correct size. I don't remember when I was so disappointed! This ring is very well made, sturdy, polished...well just wonderful. Reminds me of my Maker. Sincerely, Cathy <end>
 B0006A66P2  Sterling Silver 8 mm Wedding Band Christian Fish Spinner Ring 5/16 inch wide Hand made , ||	  Jesus Ring  This is a beautiful high quality silver ring. I couldn't help smiling as I opened the box and saw it for the first time. I have been wearing it for several months now and continue to be very pleased with it. It is very substantial, not thin, making it an excellent man's ring. However it is very suitable for a woman (such as this reviewer) as well, being a nice alternative to rings with gemstones. I also like the spinner - moving band in the center - it gives me something to do to calm my anxieties other than nail-biting or other unhealthy habits. <end>  Excellent  Very nice ring. I paid over $50 for this ring that is now $26. The ring is very durable and easy to clean. The quality is superior and I have received compliments on it. There were some minor imperfections on my ring where the inner circlet joins but overall I am pleased and would buy this ring again ... preferably at the $26 rate. The ring is a little thick, heavy, and sometimes has a jingle sound due to the inner Jesus circlet. This is definitely a good buy! <end>
 B0006A674W  Sterling Silver 5/16 inch wide 8 mm Flat Band Spinner Ring ||	  Not what it seems  This looks like a nice ring in the picture on the site, but in reality it's really rough. I returned it for my money back because I was really disappointed in the quality of the ring. For sixty dollars i was expecting something really nicely fabricated, but the outside piece didn't spin properly (at a certain point i had to force it to spin), the saldering at the seam was awful and obvious, and there were notches and imperfections all over it. Just really disappointingly poor quality. Don't trust the picture. <end>  sterling silver 5/16" flat band spinner ring size 7  I loved this ring as soon as I saw it! The spinner part spins perfectly and the craftsmanship is beautiful.No flaws that I can see or feel. Solid feel to it. Definitely a bargain for the price. Would recommend the products from Sabrina. <end>
 B0006AAOY6  Bad News Blue Racing Stripe Banana Belly Ring ||	  Quick delivery  I ordered this belly ring plus two more also by Body Candy on a Thursday and was wearing it by Saturday. No complaints, I will definitely order more! <end>
 B0006AAOZK  Juicy Fruit Stripe Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Cute-ness!  I have bought several body candy tongue rings, but I gotta say this is my ultimate favorite one! To the MAXXX lol <end>  Cute  This came extremely fast which I was very happy about and looks cute. I play with my tongue ring a lot, though and one of the balls fell off and I lost it after just one day. It looks cute and was the first thing I used after changing my piercing, and everything looks good. <end>  Just what i was looking for!  This product was just like the description. It came very quickly and I am very happy with my purchase. <end>
 B0006AAP4K  Studio Katia Victoria Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Really cute but...  It's cute, VERY cute, but the little dangling jewels kinda hide out in my belly button. So, they don't dangle so much. <end>
 B0006DN5UI  Sterling Silver Multi-Stone Caged Earth Globe Pendant ||	  Sterling Silver Multi-Stone Caged Earth Globe Pendant  This is a beautifully crafted piece, true to it's description. I found it to be an excellant value, and intend to purchase other items from this seller. <end>  Love this  The pendant is great. I can't comment on the reviewers who had issues after opening it since I have never done so. Difficult to find a chain to match the beauty of the item, the pictures don't do it justice. <end>  sterling silver globe necklace  i thought it was beautifully done and i gave it to my daughter for christmas and she loved it very much. everyone who has seen it thinks it is really a beautiful necklace <end>  Haha!!  It took me awhile to figure out how to open it but when I did it was beautiful!! I forgot to get a chain for it but my mom is going to help me. It really is the most beautiful gift in the world. <end>  nicer online than it is in person  I had wanted to get this for a while as a gift for a friend. she loves atlases, maps, and globes so i thought this would be perfect.it is beautiful online, but i was slightly unimpressed when i received it in the mail. it doesn't come with a chain and it is quite small. if i had to make the decision again, i think i would still buy it but ONLY because the idea of it was too perfect and there's nothing else like it out there.but other than that i would not think it is value for money. <end>  B. E. A. U. TIFUL  I bought this for me, as a reward more or less. But now that it is in my possession I kinda want to buy another and use it to inspire a friend or something. It is beautifully crafted and kinda fun to play with. I would definitely suggest this piece. <end>  Not their best item. Don't be fooled by the picture.  First off I would like to say that I LOVE Silver Insanity items and have bought things from them numerous times. They are a good company with quality items, but this item is not one of their best. I think they should just take it out of their inventory. I'm sad to say that this item looks much better in the picture than in real life. The metal is of poor quality, not like their usual silver products, The globe itself actually looks really cheap and ugly. I'm thinking that maybe if I found a round stone to fit inside and glued the lock shut then it might work, depending on if I can get the metal shined up to standard. Right now it's been sitting in my jewelry box for over a year and I have never actually worn it yet. Also the lock mechanism on it doesn't stay closed all the time. <end>  Rusted!  This is one of those items that looks much better on picture than it is. I received an almost rusted pendant that was impossible to open (as they are advertizing). Don't waste your money!! <end>  Got Conned  The picture online was so beautiful. To me it reminded me of the Cat collar, "Orion's Belt" from the first Men In Black movie. Not that big of a MIB fan, although I was interested in a necklace look-a-like I searched online and stumbled across this pendant.When I finally got it I was severely disappointed. The cage that was supposed to "open" Was stuck and I broke a nail attempting to open it. It's about the size of a quarter and doesn't even come with a chain.The small hole where the chain goes through is about the size of a needle head. Most of my chains wouldn't fit and the ones that did were too delicate for this half pound paper weight.The globe itself is very beautiful but the thick fake gold gridlines running through the entire globe ruin the effect.I wasn't SEVERELY disappointed but then again I didn't think I would pay nearly $40 for something the size of a bottle cap. <end>  rough looking  The earth is very unclear and the holder rough looking. I was expecting a more fine piece of jewelry. <end>  LOVE IT  I have never gotten more compliments on a piece of jewelry than I do with this one. It's awesome. I hope others don't buy it though because it's such an original piece and I want it for my own!!  ) <end>  Sterling Silver Caged Earth Globe Pendant  Item is very cool. Took a long time to get item and got no response when emailing vendor. Might use vendor again <end>  Can't trust the lock.  I have only had this piece for two days. I received it as a gift. I no longer have it. The lock on the cage opened at some point and the globe is now gone. I loved this piece. It has been on my wish list for two years. I am terribly dissapointed, and will be contacting the seller to request a refund, or a replacement of the globe. I had contemplated wireing it shut... had i been able to find the globe. <end>  Beautiful pendant!!  When I saw the pendant I fell in love! And when I received it I proved I wasn't wrong  ) Of course, I read the other reviews complaining about the lock, so I've never tried to open it.It's a gorgeous pendant, I don't have any complains, good price, great service and amazing product  ) <end>  Great piece of jewelry!  My wife loved this when I bought it for her and she almost always gets compliments on it when she wears it. In fact, she bought another one herself to give to a friend who liked it so much. The only issue is that the clasp on the cage tends to open easily and the globe can fall out, but a drop of gel superglue solved the problem - neither my wif nor I thought it was a big enough deal to knock the rating down. <end>  Earth Globe Pendant  I love this pendant. I like the way the globe comes out of the caged. I wish I would have bought two. <end>  Beautiful Reminder To All To Save The Planet  I simply adore this pendant. It is a fascinating piece of jewelry especially in this era when there is such concern about global warming and conservation of natural resources. On numerous occasions it has sparked conversations and can be worn with a t-shirt and jeans to a nice little black cocktail dress.This is not a piece that is interchangeable and I don't recommend trying to jimmy the latch. It's only meant to be decorative. I haven't mussed with mine as I've read others have done and haven't had any problems or concerns with its integrity. <end>  Pretty  This is a very nice pendant and as far as I've seen, unique. It kind of reminds of me of Orion's Belt from Men In Black  -P A little smaller than I expected, but that keeps it subtle. <end>  Very beautiful necklace!  I bought this for my sister for her birthday and she loved it. The globe inside actually rolls and you can take it out to be an actual globe. Great buy. Make sure you get a chain to match it. <end>  BAD  THIS IS THE CHEAPEST CRAPPIEST LOCKET I'VE EVER SEEN, BIGGEST RIP OFFEVER!!!!!! <end>  Cool stone, bad lock!  I bought this necklace for my wife and she loves it. The globe inside is a deep blue, and the continents are made up of different stones. The quality of the chain seems good, and the globe is not too bulky, so she can wear it comfortably without feeling like there is a giant ball hanging around her neck. The bad thing about this item is the lock that keeps the stone globe inside the case. It is just a little tab that clicks into a hole, but either the tab is not big enough or the hole is not deep enough. We have had the globe pop out five times now. Luckily it's been in the mall or while we were walking through a parking lot, so we were able to retrieve the globe every time. My wife is scared to wear it out of the house now, so it is just sitting on the dresser until we figure out how to rig the lock to make it hold better. <end>  Carry the world with you  Recieved this from my girlfriend and she wrote a very inspirational message (So it's a great gift idea!) Necklace is BEAUTIFUL, stands out and extremely well made...recieve many compliments. You can't lose with this piece <end>  Beautiful Item at a Great Price.  I bought this item for myself and after seeing it I am kicking myself I didn't by it for my friends as a Christmas gift.The Globe is very detailed and you can see all the Continents clearly. The cage that can be hung from a chain is very nice and sturdy.I don't think you could go wrong with this piece as a gift for anyone that likes silver.My suggestion is to just buy more than one. <end>  Capture the world  A very nice little piece of jewelery. For the price, it's a no brainer. Nice looks and quality. It brought a great smile and didn't burry me in debt. Pleasantly surprised. <end>  Very unusual, fabulous gift idea!  After eyeing this piece for months, I finally bought it on a whim.While it is very pretty (the itty bitty globe is just adorable and so precious), it is a bit smaller than I expected it would be. I was hoping for something larger and more attention-grabbing, but I hate to think how expensive it would have been, had it been bigger.I do enjoy wearing this piece, although I also wish the bail was a bit larger. I like to wear omegas better than chains, and this won't fit on any of my omegas, which was a big disappointment. I'm going to have to either buy a good thick silver chain, or a very slender omega.This is a necklace that definately gets comments, once people realize what it is, and I am definately going to keep it in mind as a gift-idea for friends, in the future. <end>  Nice - Remember to get a chain!  Nice quality pendant comes in a little black draw-string sack. Don't forget to get to add a chain, like I did. This is for the pendant only; no necklace! <end>  Disappointed!  Although I was pleased with the overall appearance of this pendant, after opening the world cage the clip fastener refused to re-fasten properly. It cannot be worn with confidence. Too bad! <end>  Don't open the clasp!  I loved this necklace when I saw it online and even more when I got it for Christmas. It's unusual and pretty and felt special. On Christmas I unclasped it and looked at the globe. 2 weeks later I realized I hadn't really looked at it closely and did the same. Then I spent a half hour trying to get the clasp to shut. Eventually I got it and it held for several hours but I'm pretty much just waiting for it to open. It just doesn't seem able to fasten securely. Time will tell. But I love it a lot less now that I'm not sure if it will break any minute and after only 2 weeks!Even though I like it I'm not sure I would have bought it if I'd known it would break or better yet I just wouldn't have opened the clasp. <end>  silver insanity  I needed to hold an item in a cage and Silver Insanity had some very cool options. I selected the Caged Earth Globe Pendant. It was all it was portrayed to be and it came very quickly. The only reason I don't give it a five rating is that I had to glue the clasp closed permanently as it came open when brushed against by shirts or whatever. I would use Silver Insanity again because the selection was so interesting. <end>  Gorgeous necklace  This is a lovely necklace. I received it promptly, the description was accurate, and the price fair. <end>
 B0006DN6DY  Miss America Princess Crown Sterling Silver Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  Very nice  This ring lives up to the pictures! It is solid which is good. The top of the crown does kind of angle up. So it's not a flat ring. I don't think you can really see that in the pictures. Seems true to size. My daughter loves it! <end>  Absolutely gorgeous, not to mention the complements!  I love this ring. It came right on time. It is so unique and a great price. Well worth it highly recommended. &lt;3 <end>  AWESOME!  This is the best ring I own! It's absolutely beautiful! Fit's well and looks just like the pictures. Shipping was quick, recieved it in less than a week. Great seller! 2 thumbs up! <end>  Lovely Ring  I gave this ring 5 stars because I absolutely love it. I've had it for a while now and it still looks new. <end>
 B0006DN7OM  Silver Forbidden Gothic Pentacle Cross Pendant Necklace ||	  Looks great online....  I ordered the Silver Forbidden Gothic Pentacle Cross Pendant Necklace expecting what I saw online to be a perfect example of what it could be. I understand that the online pictures are alwase better than what you will get but this does not look or feel like silver. It feels more like a plastic like resin that is more commonly used in gum ball mechine. If your not looking at it closely or people are at a distance to you it looks realy nice but the moment you pick it up you think like all my friends did "gumball mechine". <end>
 B0006DQMLW  Pugster Soldiers Of Past Flag Italian Charm Bracelet Bracelet Link ||	  Love my charms  Love my charms... I have quite a few bracelets, watch bracelets and medical bracelets. You use to be able to find the charms sold everywhere, but not now.. now mostly internet <end>
 B0006FKTSW  9 Inches 3 Hearts Ankle Bracelet in 14 kt White Gold ||	  9 inches 3 hearts white gold ankle bracelet  This anklet is as delicate and feminine as it appears in the ad. I presented it as a gift to commemorate a milestone event and the recipient has not stopped admiring it's beauty for two days now. It came in elegant packaging to signify it's worth and I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. <end>  Beautifull design  This anklet has beauty and fabulous style. Far more elegant then any other design and reasonably priced to boot! <end>
 B0006FUGZI  18 Kt Yellow Gold Handwoven Diamond Pave Bangle Bracelet ||	  Beautiful and Unique  I received this bracelet for Christmas, after wanting it for over a year. I was a bit afraid that the fantasy would not meet reality. But WOW, the craftsmanship is beautiful and looks far more expensive than the cost. The diamonds are clear and sparkle and the catch is strong and secure. The bracelet far exceeds my expectations. The seller promised a 5-day delivery, ordered one week before Christmas, but I received it in 2 days! All around a great experience. Wish you could see the bling-bling! <end>
 B0006G12J6  Tommaso Design(tm) Trillion 7mm Genuine Pink Tourmaline and Diamond Ring ||	  Pink Tourmaline ring  This is a pretty ring. On the plus side, the fit is perfect, the stones are right-sized for the price and the company does everything possible to make sure you are happy with your purchase. The rings from this company (Finejewelers) come in a choice of gold color and you just choose your size and they create it. I would buy from them again. I was a little disappointed that the picture that was shown was quite a bit larger than what arrived in the box but that is typical of on-line jewelers. Also, I was expecting a more fuschia-colored stone but I believe I would have paid more for it. <end>
 B0006G8L86  Lee Angel Gold Filigree Semi-Precious Long Chandelier Earring ||	  Never reached me  Product never reached me...waited for a month...at least managed to get money back... <end>

 B0006GC45W  Sterling Silver 5/16 inch wide 8 mm Multiple Good Luck Designs Spinner Ring ||	  pretty  The ring is very thick and weighty. It is a neat conversation piece. <end>  Kid's Lucky Charm  Son really likes this ring -- wears it on a chain. Looks nice, good quality for the price. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I'm a large male and was afraid this would look feminine, but it does not. It is chunky as other reviewers have stated. Feels handmade, not mass produced. I think it is lovely. The symbols are an owl, horseshoe, elephant,pair of children ( I think), four leaved clover, 13, and a final undefinable phallus shape ( maybe corn?). I'm quite pleased with the purchase and would order again. Cheers. <end>  The best  This ring is great! I saw it in a store for more money!Recommend this ring to anyone-Brings good-Luck! <end>  Poor quality  Very disappointed with the ring. Turned my finger green. Can't wear it accept on a chain. Beautiful ring but poor quality silver. <end>
 B0006GC4Y8  Sterling Silver 7/16 inch wide 11 mm Wide Rope Design Spinner Ring ||	  Wonderful Solid Ring  I ordered this ring and was amazed by the quality of it. It is very heavy silver - though not heavy on your hand. The ring spins freely and I often find myself deep in thought, spinning the ring. It truly is a high quality ring and I recommend it to anyone who is looking into buying a spinner ring. <end>
 B0006GC50Q  Sterling Silver 5/16 inch wide 8 mm Brick Design Spinner Ring ||	  Great product, great service  Service was great, and the ring got to me in record timeThanks! <end>
 B0006GCEAW  Christian Fish Antiqued Sterling Silver Ring(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12,13) ||	  Attractive, meaningful, ring.  I am a large-sized male, and I believe the ring looks good on me too. Just thought Id say this, as some rings are very tiny, thin, and delicate, but you dont discover that until youve ordered and rcvd it. I had to order the ring at a different website, an online Christian gift store, as I needed a size 13, and Amazon didnt/doesnt offer that size. The other website has all sizes 7-13, and this ring is called "Silver Icthus Ring" . It is a good idea, instead of buying a lot of sizes thru trial and error, to order a 'Ring Sizer' to determine your correct size first, as Jewelry stores are not real delighted to take their time to measure your size, when they know you plan to buy your ring elsewhere. The Icthus fish is etched into the ring all the way around the band. This the first Christian ring Ive worn, I like it a lot, it conveys to others that I dont really want to hear their dirty jokes etc, and reminds me of my obligation to Jesus to maintain certain standards.. and to witness to other people. <end>  great ring!  This ring is really pretty, and doesn't get dirty easily. I love it! <end>
 B0006GDVA4  Blue Crystal Eye Dragon Whelp Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Very cute  I received a pendant that looked exactly like the photo, though it was a little bit more "antiqued", but just as beautiful and cute.I bought the red-eyed one too, and it's just the same. <end>  Cute  Got this for a young dragon fan. It's cute, she loves it, reports that the other kids at school say it's cool. Nice pendant, nice price. The only thing to note is that the design is only on one side, the back is flat. (also, I tried to order the red one, but they canceled the order telling me they were sold out... then 2 days later they had them again, which was irritating) <end>   Love it!  I got the knecklace perhaps 7-8 months ago, and i have got so many compliments on it. I also have the red eyed one and I wear one or the other almost every day. I will definetly purchase other things from here in the future. <end>  blue crystaleye dragon  we were very delighted my daughter has all her girlfriends presents at hand for the year, we will be back <end>
 B0006GPGGQ  Sterling Silver Chandelier Earring With Marcasite Stones ||	  as nice as the picture but heavy  I love these earrings. They look awesome with my long chestnut hair and the marquesite sparkles just enough to catch the light now and then. But they are a bit on the heavy side; I almost returned them but in the end I couldn't part with them. That said, I haven't actually had an occasion to wear them yet... very dressy jeans and with heels kind of look I think. <end>
 B0006GQ5BQ  Giant Bearded Dragon Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Sweet Pendant  This is a nice pendant! Looks better in person than on your computer monitor. Looks good around your neck or hanging from your rear view mirror. But I wish I had big muscles to get the full effect of this fairly large necklace.  ) Who knows maybe this will give me some incentive to work out. The only con I can come up with on this necklace is that the outer dragon whisker is sharp, so I wouldn't wear this while getting rowdy or playing sports, otherwise you'll end up with a slashed up chest. I suppose you could file down the whisker to a flat surface if you really wanted to, otherwise good necklace. <end>  Beautiful!  I ordered one of these dragons for my friend in another state about two months ago. I wasn't actually able to see what this pendant looked like until my friend came and visited me a week ago. I just adored the size and quality of the pendant that I had to order a second one for my self! The pendant is huge! Absolutely lovely and a must have for any Asian dragon collector =D. <end>  Nice buy, definitely a giant dragon.  Okay, so I bought this after reading reviews and thinking "nah, the dragon can't be that big". I got it in the mail today and opened it and the first thing I thought was "okay, yeah, it is that big". This is definitely one of the largest men's pendants I've ever seen, yet it isn't so big that it looks bad. I'm wearing it now and it definitely works with my style. This is one of those necklaces that you could wear for a long time and keep, not one of the more expensive ones that you get sick of. It's a good buy, definitely worth getting if you're into that style. Good price too. <end>  Great Buy  Nice price, and looks great. Comes with a string necklace. It's actually pretty large, but it really goes well with almost anything. Excellent accessory piece, and the chicks totally dig it ;). <end>  big dragon  NICE BIG DRAGON FOR THE LOW PRICE, MUCH NICER THAN I EXPECTED. VERY HAPPY WITH IT. <end>  Dragon Pendent  Like this pendent very much. I am a body builder & is a nice size to compliment my hefty frame. I like the design very much & is quite masculine. It was exactly what I was looking for & am quite pleased.  0) <end>  Bearded Dradon  The item was just what I ordered & came in a timely manner. <end>  Giant Bearded Dragon  the pendant was way too big, the pewters bends very ealsiy and eventually it cracked. I had to throw it away.DONT BUY ITNow it is 20 words for this rdiculous review system <end>
 B0006H9XRS  Sterling Silver 3/8 inch wide 10 mm Ribbed Design Spinner Ring ||	  Nice ring - but invoice inside led to customs problems  With the product everything is OK but the invoice was inside the package and not outside (as it should have ben for international shippins). It got stuck in the customs and I had to pay an extra fee for every day in the customs' storage until I was able to pick it up... could be improved organization-wise... <end>
 B0006HAHR8  Sterling Silver 18 Inch X 2.5 mm Rope Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  not worth the $$  The chain was nice and of good quality. Unfortunately, the hook/latch was not and was not securely attached to the chain. The loop broke within the 1st week of light usage. To be fair, I did not try and contact the company to get it repaired or to return it, so I am unfamiliar with their return policy and how they would have handled this situation. <end>
 B0006HAJ6W  Sterling Silver 20 Inch X 4.0 mm Herringbone Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  Unique Design & Great Quality  This particular silver necklace nicely compliments my other jewelry treasures...such as my pendant and locket.

 B0006HALBU  Sterling Silver 30 Inch X 2.0 mm Curb Chain Necklace - O Ring Clasp - JewelryWeb ||	  bright..shiny..  This chain really shines. Its almost unreal. I dont know what's nicer. The chain, or the jewelry on it. You'll love it... <end>
 B0006HB4RA  Sterling Silver Snake Chain Beads 1.5 MM Necklace ||	  Not Bad  I've ordered this in 16" length, but I ended up with an 18" long necklace. (Measured with a measuring tape.) I didn't get charged more for it, but I had something in mind when I ordered the 16", and now it won't work. I don't know if this is a one time error or what.A regular snake chain with lobster clasp and 7 beads/balls, it isn't bad for $12. It would've been better if the chain has diamond-cutting as well, like the seller's other snake chain necklaces.The biggest bead is about 8mm in diameter, and all beads have diamond cutting, so it gives more sparkle. The beads slide/move around the chain, but you caN'T use the chain without the beads because the holes in it aren't big enough to go thru the locks. The good thing about that is you won't lose the beads. But then, you can't use it as a regular chain for a one-pendant-look either.It's not bad for everyday wear. It is noticeable but not over the top. You can wear it alone or layer with other chains. If you have detachable charms from your bracelet/s (you know, the kind that comes with a round clasp), you can put it in between the beads for a different look. <end>
 B0006HDHKW  Israel & U.S. Lapel Pin ||	  Receipt of lapel flag pin  The product was exactly what I ordered & expected - and it came in a timely fashion. Thank you for being so prompt. I enjoy doing business with Amazon - there is never a problem. <end>  Arrived on time  Thanks for making the pin available. It looks nice and the clip seems to work great. How many more words do you need. <end>  God will bless us if we bless Israel (Gen 12)  I wear this pin often to send this subtle message. People often ask about it and that gives me an opportunity to preach the gospel. Great convo starter. <end>
 B0006HFQ4C  Crystalline Gem Foxy Floweret Dangle Nipple Shield ||	  Good Buy  This ring does look just like the picture, it's very pretty. However, it's more for a night with the boyfriend than it is for every day use. Let's just say it's a bit. . . uncomfortable for everyday. Still, great buy, came quickly in the mail. I do think it should be sold in a set, but that's okay. Just remember to buy 2!! <end>
 B0006HFQ4M  Crystalline Jeweled Petals Of Passion Dangle Nipple Shield ||	  Really Cute!  This ring looks so pretty! But I wouldn't wear it for every day use. It's more like a "special occasion" sort of thing. Remember to buy two because this ring is sold separately!! Came quickly in the mail and was the right gauge. Would definitely buy from this company again. <end>
 B0006HFSZO  Passion Pink Dazzling Delight Nipple Shield ||	  Just Like The Picture  This looks just like the picture. It's very cute. Just remember to buy two, this ring does not come as a set!! <end>
 B0006HGIC6  Sterling Silver and Black Onyx Ear Threads ||	  Really great  Bought 3 pair of ear threads and really love them. They arrived in the stated pkg. in brand new condition. <end>  Ear Threaders  I ordered these during the busy Valentine season and was afraid they would be out-of-stock, but they were not. Also, considering the season, the delivery time was reasonable. I was very pleased with the quality and have received many compliments on these earrings. <end>
 B0006I7388  Cubic-zirconia Rhodium Finish Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Very pretty, a little big  With the low price of this ring, I knew I was taking a gamble. But, much to my surprise it looked better in person. Nice, not an overly costume piece. Too bad it seems to run a half size bigger than the true ring sie. I have small fingers to start with though, so it is hard to find a good fit. I gave it to my mom-in-las and she loved it. <end>
 B0006ICQ9O  Claddagh Ring With Azurite Size 8 ||	  Awsome  I bought this as a gift and was wondering how it would look up close, it was amazing, the look of the stone, the width of the ring and the detail of the ring's crown all very nice, it is sleek and sexy, if feels almost weightless, but the sterling silver is solid, and strong. the stone's look was a beautiful and deep navy blue with aqua blue mix within it. The Clauda is strong and lasting. <end>
 B0006ICUJU  Claddagh Band Size 9 ||	  Awesome  This was the "man-liest" claddagh ring I could find for my guy. I got it today within 4 days of ordering it. It looks really nice, came ahead of time, and comes in a great leather ring box. And it is quite affordable. Only complaint is the note that I wanted to come with it is cut-up computer paper taped to a card.  / But for the most part, it is great. Just hope it fits!  ) <end>  Beautiful Ring  I was very happy with the product because it arrived looking just like the picture online. Also, it arrived in the time I needed it. <end>  Beautiful  This ring was beautifully made with great attention to detail. The design was masculine, yet included all of the symbols of the Claddagh. Most bands I found did not include the crown. It came in a nice leather ring box too! <end>
 B0006IHRM0  Ocean Waves Pattern Pewter Bangle Bracelet ||	  Great Bracelet  Ordered this bracelet from Amazon, got it very quickly and have had it for a few weeks. I wear it all the time ane love it. It is exactly what I wanted and just what they said it was. I am very happy with the product! <end>
 B0006IHS3I  Celtic Irish Cross Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Great Item!!!!  This is a beautiful Celtic Cross Necklace. It was made in Thailand. The shipping does take a bit longer than the rest, unless you live in or close to Thailand. They are even nice enough to send a post card along when your shippment arrives. The package arrived in great shape! Hope this review helps those who have never heard of Dan's Jewelers! I know I'm going to buy from him more often! <end>  Great gift!  I purchased a bunch of these as gifts for leaders in my parish. They have been a big hit! Great quality. Really nice looking. Affordable. <end>  Celtic Cross  I love this cross. Dan's Jewelers is great to buy from, very nice people! <end>  Great buy! Nice pendant and cord  After reading some of the not-so-glowing comments, I didn't expect much. I was quite surprised! The cross has a nice weight to it. Mine was not shallow or off-center. I don't mind that the ring background isn't filled in. That makes it rather unique. I actually look forward to the tarnish appearing, which indicates the presence of true silver. Another surprise was the black cord. It's length is adjustable! At it's longest it's 32 inches in length. Pull the two knots at the nape of the neck to make the length shorter, down to 17 inches. Nice!. The cord is braided and lightly lacquered, like a good shoelace. Very comfortable and not irritating to the skin. It's worth the price! BTW, a business card and a velvet-type drawstring jewelry bag was all that was in the package with this necklace. No note to add a positive review! <end>  tiz good  This cross fits my needs for a large noticeable cross dangling around my neck. I have a lot of fun with this cross. The loop on it is large enough to fit my leather cord chain. It is bendable, so one needs to be careful to not put it in harm's way. <end>  small but fine piece of "Irish" jewelry.  This is another example of fine Irish/celtic jewelry, along with the previous reviewed cross, really neat, but small, good for not getting in the way, while wearing, but as a fine demonstration of faith. I have one. <end>  Authenic  I am very pleased with my pewter necklace which arrived quickly. It is well-made and I have received many compliments on it. I would buy from this company again! <end>  It's okay but...  For a price of less than $10, this is a pretty good cross. The pewter hasn't oxidized yet,but feels like ok quality. The design workmanship is a bit disappointing because the circular solar element has no knotting at all, which is the first Celtic Cross I've seen this way. This ring is simply smooth and mirror-like, and has the effect of looking like a 3/4 inch nickelplate washer. Looks a bit unfinished and therefore cheap, I must say. I really do like the black drawstring, which allows the Cross to hang at various heights, according to whether and how you want to show it. Again, for the price, one can't really complain. I didn't look closely enough at the photo to notice the inappropriately untooled ring element. <end>  Disappointed in Oregon  My wife did not much care for this cross. It arrived with the appearance that it had been used. Seller mailed me special discount offer, if I wrote a glowing review about their product. I don't think so... <end>  A double disappointment  I had actually ordered the other Celtic cross from Dan's Jewelers (priced at $11.84), and so the fact that they sent this one in error was the first disappointment. When I examined this item, I was also disappointed in the workmanship--the engraving is shallow and off-center, and the cross looks very "cheap." I've seen a lot of Celtic-style jewelry in a wide range of prices, and this is definitely "low-end" in every respect. <end>  CS  The item came in a timely manner and was what I had been looking for. My daughter loves it. <end>  Beautiful Religious Symbol  Wonderful size for high school young man. Looks well made. Arrived exactly on time as indicated. It will be a very appropriate present for Confirmation <end>  It's okay, if you like pewter.  I've had this for 4 years now. I'm amazed it lasted this long. Cleaning pewter is not my strong point, but it's as easy as cleaning silver. <end>  Celtic Cross  My son had been wanting one of these for a while. When it arrived he loved it and hasn't taken it off yet. <end>  Celtic Irish Cross Pewter Pendant Necklace  I chose this item because someone requested a celtic cross for Christmas. I think they liked it. It was a gift. <end>  Beautiful  I love Celtic crosses and this one is by far the most beautiful one I own. It was worth the price. <end>  Nice Celtic Cross  I got this for my 40 year old husband for Christmas and he hasn't taken it off since...at all. It has been about a year and it looks great. It does need a new cord though. It was a great buy, he's hard to shop for. <end>  Very nice piece!  The cross is beautiful! I love the detail of the Trinity in the middle. The size is perfect, I like very much how it stands out. The cord is adjustable, but I will change it soon. Also, it was a fast delivery. It's a quality product even though it's pewter, dont' underestimate it! Would buy again from the seller. <end>  Nice Cross  It is a simple yet tastefull piece of pewter that I wear every day. I would give it as a give to any one, Especially if they are Irish. <end>  it a nice cross  This celtic cross is a great cross i love it wear it all the time have had it for about a month but there just one thing i really dont like and i think some people over shot this little fact that the cross while being cheap it made from some cheap material it bends and sometimes when im working or moving alot the cross will bend and im scared to bnd it back feels a little clumsy but you just have to be careful with it like the other guy said its a real nice cross dont get me wrong just wish it was more durable than this <end>  Nice necklace  The celtic knots inside the cross look pretty nice, for the price you can't beat this thing its a good pendant. But do be careful, it is Pewter so it can bend. I recommend getting some type of silver necklace to go with it and not using the cord, looks cheap. <end>  Wearing it as I speak  I've owned this necklace for over 6 months now, and the black string it came with is holding like new. It looks great, and has a nice feel to it. The teachers at my college give me points for wearing a "cross" and the others who actually know the difference between christian and Celtic crosses understand the symbolism. It looks great, and holds up strong. Been through more then a few accidental trips in the washer. <end>  Great Cross!  I am very pleased with this cross. The detail is very good, and it has a good weight, but not too heavy. I prefer Pewter jewelry, since it will not tarnish like Sterling Silver has a tendency to do. Much cheaper as well, and with the quality of this it is a very good deal! I am completely happy with the cross and the seller! <end>  Celtic Irish Cross,Dan's Jewellers  Excellent,excellent service,a most helpful company when my original purchases were lost somewhere between the USA and South Africa. An excellent product and I will most certainly buy from this company again. Gerald Wright. <end>  Good  Got here in a moderately good amount of time. Decoration was only on one side of the pendant. Otherwise, pretty sturdy. <end>  Nice  The Celtic Irish Crosses I purchased from Amazon are what I expected. Nice and the same as pictured. I would recommend this necklace to anyone who wishes to show their Celtic heritage. <end>
 B0006IPRKY  Pugster Name Natasha Italian Charms Bracelet Link ||	  Coffee Charm  I totally love this saying on the charm. It is a bit small to read, but you can see it. Product came quickly and was exactly as described and pictured. <end>

 B0006JD5YI  Sterling Silver 5/16 inch wide 8 mm Celtic Knot Design Spinner Ring ||	  disappointed  the ring looked great when i first looked at it, but upon closer inspection, there was clearly a mistake made when soldering the ring together. there was a large silver blob on the ring. also, the ring did not spin properly. it would spin in one direction when using a great amount of force and would not spin in the other direction at all.on a positive side, the return process was quite simple and my refund was credited to my card quickly. <end>
 B0006JDAK2  Sterling Silver 5/16 inch wide 8 mm Woven Design Spinner Ring ||	  Sabrina Silver  The ring that I ordered was absolutely beautiful. I received it in two days from the date that I placed the ordered. Awesome service!!! Thanks Sabrina Silver! <end>  quality and price !!!  got this as a replacement wedding ring...I have lost two rings so I wanted something not was cheap but did not look cheap...well just got the ring in and think I hit the nail with this one....great fit and finish sizing was perfect shipping was quick...3 days...and you can't beat the price... <end>  Excellent  Was more beautiful in person than pictured.

Let me know when you get some real cool guys bracelets in <end>
 B0006JDIOA  10K White Gold 1/4 ct. Diamond Cross Pendant with Chain ||	  Satisfied Customer  The pendant is very pretty and it is just the right size. Also, Katrina Jewelery went out of their way to ensure my satisfaction and was diligent in making me a satisfied customer. Thank you. <end>
 B0006JDIUO  10K White Gold 1/2 ct. Diamond J-Hoop Earrings (Highest Quality) ||	  pretty earrings, poor accounting  The earrings are lovely, understated with a hint of sparkle. Easy to wear every day and elegant enough for the most formal functions. I have no problem with the product and would have given five stars - however I was over-billed for the item. I ordered the earrings at $325 for which they were offered on Katarina's website. When they arrived I found I'd been billed $365. Probably just sloppy accounting, but the company has not responded to my emails and furthermore as I live outside the USA, getting a refund is unlikely to be easy. I adore the earrings and have had good service in the past, but this time I feel ripped off by the company. <end>
 B0006MF2VE  Pugster Alice In Wonderland Storybook Part 1 Italian Charm ||	  Beautiful  I got these for my sister just as a cute little gift. There aren't any great pictures online of what the charms really look like, but I have to say, I was very impressed. They're very beautiful and detailed. I believe they are more than worth the cost. <end>
 B0006MJ6PC  Mother and Daughter Keepsake Box - 26607 by Willow Tree ||	  Great Mother's Day Gift  My mom loved this! I live in Portugal and she lives in MN so I had to buy something that could be shipped directly to her and this was great!! The shipping was too fast!!! and the price was very reasonable! Makes a great gift! <end>
 B0006MTR3I  King Chess Piece Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Brother didn't like it.  I got this necklace for my brother because he's really good at chess, and I thought he'd like it. But he ended up saying that it wasn't the universal sign for a king. <end>
 B0006MTR42  Royal Fleur De Lis Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Pretty cool, but not durable  The necklace string came knotted a few times. It was an annoyance! Otherwise, it's a pretty cool necklace. <end>  Great item  ordered one of these for myself, had to go back and order two more for gifts. Great size, great price <end>  fleur di lis pendant  I love anything French, especially things that are within my price range. This pendant is lovely, well made and by no means tiny, just the perfect size. <end>  Very Happy  Super Nice Pendant! This is definitely some top quality stuff right here. Way better than expected and shipped really fast! <end>  Simple yet elegant  I absolutely love this pendant. I ended up taking it off the chord and put the pendant on a slinky silver chain I owned previously. The bevel in the back of the pendant is not very large so you might want to be careful before removing anything. Its very shiny and sleek, it doesnt look as grainy as in the picture. Very pretty and not expensive making it a great find. My hubby tries to steal it from me constantly. <end>
 B0006N09KC  Long Sterling Silver Dachshund Weiner Dog Pin Brooch ||	  Adorable Gift  This sweet little pin was a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law. She loves dachshunds, and she loved this pin. It's of good quality, a nice size for wearing on a jacket or sweater, and super cute. <end>  A very nice gift...  ...for someone like my mother-in-law, who is mad about daschunds! I really liked the sleek simplicity of this brooch - small but striking. I thought the price was reasonable and communication was good. I would definitely use this seller again. <end>  dog pin  pin arrived faster than expected and was well packaged. It is sturdy and well made. I like the sleek and flowing design. I used this as a accent piece in a serving tray I built for a friend who loves these dogs. <end>
 B0006N2OMS  Sterling Silver and Crystal Single Heart Charm Bracelet, 8" by Paris Hilton ||	  Nice until the stones fell out  I am afraid to wear it now because I lost a stone and don't want to lose another! I think it is gorgeous though... <end>  Paris Hilton Charm Bracelet  The bracelet is beautiful, but alas two weeks after receipt of bracelet, one of the pink gems fell out and was lost. I considered it too expensive to return. Australian dollar exchange and deliver costs were too dear for me. But your site is fantastic...if only I used it in the USA <end>  That's Hot!!  I love my heart bracelet so much. It is so cute. The only problem I have with it is the clasp is hard to open. But, otherwise it is a great product. <end>
 B0006N3DUA  Sterling Silver Mesh Ring Handmade 5/16 inch wide, sizes 5 - 11 ||	  Not true to size  The ring is beautiful but not true to size. I wear size ten but 1/2 size larger would have been more comfortable in this design. <end>  VERY NICE AND SOLID RING  I BOUGHT THIS AFTER SEEING A LADY WEARING IT AT WORK...IT'S VERY WELL MADE AND SOLID, IT EVEN HAS A STAMP INSIDE WITH 925 THE NUMBERS FOR SILVER...I WEAR IT ALL THE TIME AND GET COMPLEMENTS ON IT...VERY NICE ACCESSORY. <end>  Good quality  My purchase came in quickly. The ring didn't change colors which shows it authenticity for the most part. I'm a happy customer. <end>  Awesome  Awesome seller  fast shipping, good product. the ring is perfect, in perfect condition. Thank you! <end>  mesh ring  I recieved the ring very quickly. It looks great. However, there is a broken piece of mesh which occured after shipment. It was not broken when I got it. It cannot be worn or it will scratch me. I was diligent in taking it off to wash up. I was gentle with it. I did not return it, but I do have to bring it somewhere to have it soddered. I feel I should have spent the money and gotten the "Tiffany" ring. <end>  Very Cool Ring and Super Fast Shipping!  This is a great ring--very high quality for the price. The shipping was super speedy. I had the ring within a few days of ordering. Would highly recommend this seller. <end>  Great ring- looks just like the pictures show  I love the ring- I get a lot of compliments on it! <end>  FAST Delivery  Received this item in no time... Would recommend purchasing from this seller - VERY fast delivery! <end>  mesh ring  it was difficult to get the sizing correct, but the ring is very lovely and I have gotten many complements on it. <end>
 B0006N3KLW  Ladies 2.50 Carat Diamond 14KT White Gold Tennis Bracelet ||	  Beautiful bracelet - incredible value  I had been looking for an everyday diamond bracelet for some time. I was so surprised by the price for this quality that I emailed the Sunset Collection to ensure that the diamonds were "eye-clean". They responded in 1 day. The bracelet has exceeded my expectations. As there are only 28 diamonds, each stone is a little over 7 points. It's a perfect size -- noticeable without being ostentatious. I love it and would definitely order from the Sunset Collection again. <end>
 B0006NX1XE  Sterling Silver Heart Locket on Cable Chain, 18" ||	  Very pretty locket but.....  I agree with the other reviewer, the locket is beautiful but the necklace is really thin. It ripped two weeks after I got it and I had to replace it with another thicker chain. But other than that, it's a very nice locket that can hold two pictures and would look very nice if it were engraved. <end>  Valentine's Day Winner.  I believe the heart shaped locket is a one-of-a-kind thing. It is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large. The silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures. Due to the size of the locket, a dainty, smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket. Therefore, while I was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews, I took a risk and am happy with this purchase. The pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection.Good gift.Sincerely,The guy who usually blows it on the Valentine's Day gift. <end>  Cute Little Locket  Very cute locket that would look excellent engraved with initials or a picture.I gave this item four stars because I think the chain could be a little more sturdy. <end>  Beautiful!  I am very pleased with the locket. It is a nice size, but not too big-definitely large enough to be engraved. The chain is pretty and appears to be strong. It arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box. My daughter was delighted with it! <end>  Picture lies  The picture makes it look much nicer than it actually is. But for $30-40 its hard to complain. Spouse likes it, but I would not buy it again if I saw it first. <end>  My wife loves it!  I bought this necklace after reading reviews about different types breaking easily. This one is very good so far, and my wife loves it. For the price I paid it is a great product. <end>  Great necklace and Locket!  This necklace is beautiful. The chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty. A great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler. A true steal at a sale price of under $30.00. <end>  A Great Gift!  This is a great gift. There is an area for two photos. I gave it to my wife with a photo of myself and my son in it in black and white. She loved it! It was sort of hard to get the photos in, but worth the time. My only complaint is that the locket piece has a tendency to fall off of the chain, but that can be fixed. <end>  pretty for a decent price  I thought this was a very pretty lil keepsake. I think simple is very nice, and it's simple in design and what not. Plus it's not too expensive and as a "thoughtful" gift it will win lots of points. <end>  I  I love it great product A + + + + + + + + + + + + ++ + <end>  Good Locket  Got this for my kids so they could give it to my wife as a present at Christmas time. They put their pictures inside and wrapped it up for her and put it under the tree. My wife opened it up and she could just stare at it and the pictures inside. She absolutely loved it and it made the morning at Christmas. This is a great present and I couldn't of asked for a better present for my kids to give to their mom. <end>  Very thin chain, good locket  This is a nice locket, pretty in its simplicity. The locket is the perfect size and weight, the chain a good length, and it shines well. The chain is extraordinarily thin however, any little catch and it will snap. I wouldn't recommend it for anything more than occasional wear because of that. <end>  Pretty, but not without its little problems  I received this locket as a gift from my fiance and although it's pretty and casual, I have two issues with it. First, the clasp keeps catching my hair. And second, it got easily tarnished. If you want to buy this locket, make sure to buy some jewelry cleaner to keep it shiny. <end>  It's engravable!  I bought this locket and got it engraved with my sons name on it(Caden) It looked great. You could fit 5 or 6 letters on it. It was a good locket. <end>  The Locket...  Someone near and dear to me loved it...and the price was right! Valentine's Day is coming...it makes a great gift! <end>  Excelente producto!!  Es increible la calidad de sus productos, los felicito, cuenten conmigo como un cliente fiel.Att.Hector MejiaHonduras <end>  Do Not Buy  Product Code Error!  Ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what I received was worse than expected in part because Amazon sent the wrong item. Spoke with Customer Service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first; however, the same WRONG item was again sent. The problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket, one even cheesier than the product listed. I contacted Customer Service regarding the replacement; they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct ... eventually. Both lockets have been returned; there didn't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket. I wound-up ordering a completely different design from another vendor. <end>  Con artists at Amazon  Amazon sucks, I bought the locket for 23.99 in PLENTY of time in the "Gold Box" deal and go to check out and they charge me 40.00. what a rip off, of course I cancelled it. I use to like this place but not anymore <end>
 B0006O1H8E  Winged Sterling Silver Spread Open Phoenix Wing Pendant ||	  Beautiful!  This pendant is very well crafted, and there is an incredible amount of detail that is only hinted at in the image shown here. It's lightweight and the perfect size  big enough to get noticed, but not so large that it's distracting.The phoenix is the symbol of rebirth and freedom. If you're starting a new career, getting over a bad relationship, moving to a new place...this is the perfect way to celebrate your new path. <end>  Necklace  The necklace was beautiful and came in a very nice pouch. I did not readwell or it was not clear however that the pendant was separate from a chain. <end>  A must have!  If you love the Phoenix myth you need this pendant. It is better looking in person. I put it on the moment I got it and have not took it off. It has a wonderful feel to it. Great detail. It has a positive engery to it. A must have! It was shipped to me the day before I was told. I got it within three days. I will do more buisness with Silver Insanity again. <end>  Silver Insanity wins again!  I've ordered several items from this company and have always been pleased. This item in particular I was happy to aquire, I love phoenixes. This pendant is a decent size -- not overbearing yet still large enough to see good detail. It arrived in a fairly short amount of time as well. Very nice piece to add to my ever-growing SS collection. <end>  Winged Sterling Silver Spread Open Phoenix Wing Pendant  I was pleased with this item. My only criticism is that it is smaller than it appears in the pictures, so I was decieved. I was hoping for a larger pendant.. However, my wife really likes it and it came with a nice little velvetine bag in which to store it..... <end>  Loved this pendant - don't forget to buy a chain!  I bought this pendant for myself and one for a friend. We both loved them! They are beautiful. Just DON'T FORGET TO BUY A CHAIN! I did not know it did not come with a chain. You can get one cheap from Silver Insanity when you check out. I had to run to a store and buy a chain, because i was giving it as a gift and needed to give it right away. BUY A CHAIN! <end>  it was magic  I wore the phoenix necklace at my first trip to the Magic Castle where I got compliments from the waiter and some of the magicians <end>  Perfect!  I came across this looking for angel pendants. I bought this one and the matching earrings. I absolutely love this pendant! Wear it all the time and always get compliments on it. They always want to know where I purchased it. Beautiful. You will never regret buying this pendant! <end>  STUNNING!  I get so many compliments on this pendant. It is so beautiful. It is not too big nor too small. The details on it are amazing. And the packaging was the icing on the cake. I could have easily just sent it to someone directly as a gift and not worry about the presentation. Wonderful experience! <end>  simple and beautiful  i love this pendant, every time i wear it people want to know where i got it, back in the 70's we bought items that reminded us of the eagles and lynn skynn's Free Bird. so when i wear it it reminds me of the good old days. yeah i know it's a pheonix, but whn i bought it was called an eagle.(ebay) <end>  not completely happy...  I love the actually pendent the time it got there was great. But I really didn't like how they show the pendent on a chain because I bought it for the whole package (chain included). So when I got it I was SHOCKED that it didn't included it. So buyers beware this supplier doesn't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra $15-$30 even thou they adversities it in their ad. <end>  Dont expect what you see.  I bought this item for my soon to be hubby it was so small i could have just threw it in the trash. <end>  Beautiful!  This is a really gorgeous piece. I don't usually wear such large jewelry or much jewelry at all but this one is a great one to wear. <end>  Flight of the Phoenix  An enchanting delight, this peace of jewelry is very different, you receive compliment every time you wear it, and it has an Egyptian feel. I wear it with my white gold pieces (despite the fact that it is Sterling Silver) <end>  Beautiful pendant but sorry customer service!  This was the first time we bought something from a differnt seller other than AMAZON. Bad choice. This is without a doubt a beautiful, trendy, tatooish looking pendant but that's if you luck out and get it when there's staff working. My husband ordered this for Christmas and we even paid extra for it to arrive on Christmas eve, nope. We received it today. After two emails to the seller, still no response but a cute little pendant. <end>  wonderful  cloud be fire bird or eagle. this is big shinee. great. if you want ad to your shash of stuff. <end>  I've had this pendant for years  I wear it everyday and wouldn't trade it for anything. It not only has held up very well but I get at least one "how beautiful!" a day. It's difficult to find beautiful Phoenix jewelry and there's none better than this piece. <end>  Very nice item as expected!  I got the item very fast (a bit less than two weeks, which is grand considering it's standard overseas shipping) and am very pleased with it.The picture here resembles the actual item very well, and the pendant is really as light (5 grams) as it says, which was one reason why I bought it and not something else. The amount of detail is admirable as well; it is small enough to be noticeable but discreet. Overall it looks quite delicate but considering it isn't involved in anything strenous, it should be fine. Overall I'm very happy with it.Note that it doesn't come with a chain; you need to get it separately or at gift checkout options. <end>  make sure to add chain if you want one..  Pendant does not include chain and must be ordered seperately which is fine but wasn't clear to me at time of purchase so I was surprised when it came without one... <end>  BEAUTIFUL!!!!  I received this on Saturday and was very impressed. Not too heavy, but Not light weight. They say, you get what you pay for, I got more, much more!! It was just what I was looking for. Also, very fast shipping, which I really liked!! Thanks so much ... I would definitely tell all my friends. <end>  Excellent item  I am delighted with this pendant. It is beautifully crafted and easy to wear with any necklace length. It was well packaged, and shipped at the speed of light, which was very impressive too. A pleasant shopping experience for me and I definitely plan to shop again at Silver Insanity. <end>  Beautiful Detail  This is a lightweight beautiful and original piece of wearable art. The phoenix, most recently of Harry Potter fame, was also an early Christian symbol of the resurrection. As has been noted previously, it does not come with a chain. I paired it with a black cord which looks great. I have bought several things from this company and have been very pleased with the service and quality of their products and look forward to future purchases. <end>  Rebirth  I was looking for a new pendant, something to signify big changes I am making in my life, something to wear as a reminder of my "rebirth." I love this pendant. It is a nice size and weight, the edges are smooth and it is comfortable to wear. The matching earrings are small and probably won't get used much, but this will get lots of wear. <end>  Absolutelt Perfect!!!  I received this pendant a few weeks ago and have had many compliments on it. I like it so much I'm considering having a picture of it tattooed on my arm. It symbolizes so much in my life. It truly is a beautiful piece. <end>  IMPRESSIVE  ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, PERFECT SIZE, GREAT DETAIL FOR THE $$$$. SHIPPED FAST IN A NICE VELVETINE BAGGIE. <end>  Perfect  I had the pendant in 3 days, insted of 3 weeks! And that from the US to the Netherlands. Many thanks for that. The Pendant itself is perfect, very detaild and it looks great. <end>  Awesome  This pendant is amazing. The craftsmanship is top of the line. It is a bold size and I have found it very easy to clean with plain old silver cleaner. Beautiful piece. <end>  Beautiful and finelly crafted  Very nice pendant. Approximately 2" width. Very finelly made, with a high quality appearance. Can be used short or long. The earings make a really nice combination too. <end>  winged sterling silver spread open phoenix wing pendant.  this is a beautifull piece,my boufriend just loves it.its a nice size too! great as a gift for a man or woman.thanks <end>  Beautiful craftsmanship with just a little polishing needed  The pendant of course comes with no chain. But most accompanying chains lack quality and are better replaced anyway so no loss in choosing your own to better compliment the main piece while not wearing the inclusion price for an inadequate one. So factor that in when weighing up the true cost.The craftsmanship (fine detail) is extremely well done right down to the fine head feathers of the Phoenix. Not too large or small (basically the disc size of the piece is that of tip of middle finger touching tip of thumb on an average sized person.You might feel a little disappointed upon initially opening the little bag the product comes in as mine looked quite a bit duller (a bit like stainless steel to be honest) than that depicted by Amazon which shines like a mirror. However - dont panic - a little silver polish gently applied and the true beauty of the piece will be revealed as the tarnish is wiped away. Pity the seller didnt do that before sending but then again...once the sale is made why fuss they probably thought.As gold becomes almost out of reach for a similar size product for most people, this piece is confirmation you can still catch the eye with that other precious metal "Silver" and receive praise for your taste. My wife has and so shall your lady friend. The matching - though smaller - earing set of the same design is recommended too for those who like a "set" within their collection.Highly recommended. <end>  Love this pendant  Got this pendant about a month ago and, once I tracked down a chain I was happy with, have worn it every day. After going thru a series of personal tragedies last year, looking at this phoenix symbolizes and reminds me of the new beginnings and rebirth in my life.Well, back to the phoenix. It's well crafted and I LOVE the design. While the image on Amazon is very good, it really doesn't convey the intricate details on this pendant. Looking at it, you can see the attention to detail that went into the design. From every feather on the wings to the eyes and beak on the head (the triangle at the bottom)Excellent service and prompt delivery from Silver Insanity. Would be happy to do business with them again (and I already have since). <end>  Beautiful!  I love my phoenix pendant! It's beautiful and perfect, and the detail is great. I'm very pleased with the quality. I've already received two compliments on it in the first 30 minutes of wear. Looks terrific with the 16" satin cord necklace. I would buy from this seller again. <end>  Phoenix in flight  The detail is very good. Silver insanity has created another piece of art work for your neck <end>  phoenix pendant  As pictured, pretty nice looking piece. I ordered this along with the earings as a gift. <end>  VERY PRETTY  THIS PENDANT IS VERY UNIQUE AND VERY PRETTY. IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. <end>  beautiful and unusuall ...my favore one  When u wear it you would feel great connection with energy. <end>  Phoenix Fan  I purchased this Pendant for a Family member and when the person opened it up they coundn't stop talking about how Beautiful it is.The detailing on this is great and it was the perfect size hangs nicely around the neckline. <end>  Love this  This is one of the best Phoenix pendants that I have seen. Slightly larger than I was hoping but still looks great. <end>  Beautiful  The necklace was gorgeous and very detailed, it is not too big and not too small so it is just the perfect pendant to wear during special occasion. <end>  So pretty!  I opened the package as soon as it arrived, which was just a couple of days after I placed my order. I ordered the recommended chain along with it and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! It is so pretty and looks even nicer than the picture online! I look forward to ordering more items from Silver Insanity! <end>  NO CHAIN  Pendant is a unique design, yet it is shown on an angle because the one I received has a tarnished dimple in the bottom where the wings come together which in my opinion cheapens the look and it does NOT line up with the point of the phoenix's beak. I'm sure no one else will notice. They should have made it all one without the dimple to make it look more uniform. JMO <end>  Striking Pendant  My pendant came today and I am very happy with it. It looks lovely on a 16" black silk cord. It's the perfect size, not too large, and the curves soften the effect. I wore it today with a turquoise V-neck T-shirt, and the effect was striking, but not even remotely gaudy. Very good value. Silver Insanity was very prompt with delivery. <end>  love it  It was just as nice as it appeared on the website. I love it!, Great price for the quality. fast shipping <end>  A WINNER  This is just BEAUTIFUL!!!! I got it for my husbands birthday, but thinking of getting one for myself, considering they sell matching earrings. My husband wears it all the time and loves it, I recommend getting the leather braided rope for it ( 20 inch ) it really sets it off for a man. I have bought many pieces from Silver Insanity and can highly recommend them. <end>  I like it A LOT!!  First, it was received in record time. Ah, instant gratification.Secondly, It's a fine piece for the price.I was very satisfied. The detail is good. And I've gotten quite a few compliments. A unique looking pendant. I'm wearing it now!!! <end>

 B0006O9ZI8  Sterling Silver and Gemstone Beaded Earrings ||	  Southwest Spirit  Exquisite workmanship; beautiful use of colored beads and sterling silver. Very comfortable. Extremely attractive. Hugs your cheek, and moves like the wind when you move. The picture doesn't do justice to these outstanding earrings. <end>
 B0006OATDI  1 Carat Sterling Silver CZ Heart Pendant ||	  Lovely  I pirchased this as a gift for a friend. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It was so much nicer than expected -- with such a low price my expections weren't high. I had been looking at CZ pendants for awhile. I wanted an adjustable chain and a nice size stone. I got exactly what I was looking for with this. It is really lovely and the stone is just the right size. In fact, I like it so much, I just ordered another for myself. Thank you, Amazon. You have never disappointed me. <end>
 B0006OATGK  4.5 Carat Sterling Silver CZ Tennis Bracelet ||	  It's ok  It's pretty, but the clasp isn't staying that well on mine. I'm not in love with it, but it is pretty. <end>  Great alternative to the real thing!  This bracelet is in a setting almost exactly like my wife's real one. I was surprised to see that the stones didn't look like a typical fake bracelet. Now, instead of being concerned of wearing her real diamond bracelet, she can wear this one all the time. And for the price, you can't beat it! <end>  WHY BUY THE REAL THING...THIS BRACELET IS GORGEOUS!  I have diamond tennis bracelets in white and yellow gold and this bracelet looks even better than the real thing. It sparkles beautifully, is well crafted and the price cannot be beat. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great tennis bracelet, this is the one. THANKS FOR MAKING QUALITY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT AFFORDABLE PRICES!! <end>  Very nice looking but be very careful with it.  It looks great, my girlfriend thought it was real at first and loved it. Just be extremely careful with it because we were goffing around and it broke really easy. I fixed it myself under a magnifying glass and she is going to be more careful while wearing it. Definitly not for everyday usage. <end>  Very nice  I purchased this for my wedding. I have sensative skin and didnt have a ton of money to go and buy anything super expensive. It came very neatly packaged and it sparkled perfectly for my big day! Highly recommend! <end>  Broke on first wear!  I ordered this bracelet and it is beautiful! I love that its not too big. The problem? I wore it to dinner and it literally broke in half. I dont even know when it happened, i looked down and noticed it was gone and found in laying on the floor. Extremly disappointing. Also the clasp was extremly loose and i actually had to make the holes a little smalled so it would work better. <end>  Wife loved it but...  So my wife loved it, more so then I thought she would. Its just real enough looking and not too over the top.I give it 4 stars becasue she commented on how the clasp feels cheep. It has not yet broken, but based on many of the other reviews here I am somewhat afraid that it will.For now we are keeping it, but just beware. At the moment I am giving it 4 stars since it has not yet broken. <end>  Nice Bracelet but you must tighten the 2 figure 8 clasps  This is a nice bracelet it's very shiny and so far pretty stable I've had it a couple of weeks and have never taken it off, but you do have to tighten the figure 8 clasp so that it has a secure grasp on the little bump. and that's why i gave it only 3 stars. <end>  Beautiful!  In lieu of buying my fianc&eacute;e the $5K diamond tennis bracelet I've had my eye on, I decided to get this at 1% of the cost. She loves it! I'm very glad that I bought it for her! <end>  disappointed  I thougt the bracelet was pretty but the clasp was very cheaply made. It is very hard to get on and once you do clasp does not stay closed. A waste of money. <end>  Great for the price!  After reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try. Delivery was very fast. When I first opened the box, I was disappointed  it was light, the silver does look different from my other white gold jewelry (this is my first silver jewelry). The stones are not as sparkly as the diamond on my ring.However, the size fits me very well(I am 5"2 petite) and the size of the stones are just right. It looks very pretty! I decided to give a try before returning it.After wearing it for a day, I started to like it. Now two weeks passed by, I am in love with it!Considering the price I paid for, this is a GREAT classic looking bracelet! Highly recommend!Bottom line  a fun, pretty and classic piece for the price! But don't expect that it looks like the real gold with diamond. It ISN'T. <end>  So-so bracelet.  Super quick delivery but as far as it 'looking real' uhhh - no... I do however like the bracelet, just don't purchase thinking you will fool anyone into thinking it's gold and diamonds. <end>  terrible clasp quality  The clasp bends and breaks with just a couple of wears. It's a beautiful piece, but you won't get very much use out of it because the dang clasp bends and breaks so easily. <end>  Tennis Bracelet  I bought this Bracelet for my wife she wore it one day and it broke at the clasp. Not very good quality. I would like to say though I sent it back and requisted a refund and was very satified that the company refunded my money no questions ask. I thank then for that. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful-Everyone Should Buy this Bracelet  I ordered and paid for this bracelet on 12/31/12. The ETA was 1/7 to 1/9 2013. The bracelet actually arrived 1/4 2013 way ahead of this ETA. Because I first read all the customer reviews before purchasing, I did tighten the two side clasp hinges which I personally believe is no big deal considering the price I paid for it. The bracelet is now tightly clasped and I fear no possiblity of it opening and slipping off. I also tried numerous times to make sure I will be able to open and close it on my own and have no trouble doing so. I do, however, advise anyone buying this bracelet to also tighten those two side clasp hinges before wearing it. All you need is a clamp or even a scissors would do the trick.The actual bracelet is just beautiful. It sparkles and catches the light like real diamonds. The diamonds themselves are also small enough to fool anyone except for possibly a jeweler. It layers beautifully with my two other silver bracelets as I now mostly wear either white gold or sterling silver. And just like my other two bracelets, I will always wear it and not take it off to save time in the mornings.Also, I used to watch and buy a lot of jewelry from QVC. From what I have learned over the years, diamonds really glisten when cast in either white gold or silver as versus yellow gold. And the savings in cost from buying this bracelet as versus a diamonique bracelet from QVC is $60 or higher. And it looks just as beautiful as any of the jewelry I have ever bought from this TV shopping channel. I am so so pleased with my present to me. Love it. <end>  Beautiful!  Just received my bracelet and it's stunning! My mother owns a real tennis bracelet, we compared and mine sparkles just as much for a lot less money! Looks great layered with a watch as well. Very happy with my purchase! <end>  cool bracelet!!!  just received my bracelet and it looks great!!! love it!! you will not be disappointed at all!!!goes great with a watch, it's not fake looking <end>  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT  When I purchased this bracelet, I was hesitant because of the fact that I had not seen it in person. When the package came in the mail and I opened it, I was more than happy with it. I wear it everyday, even in the bath. It is beautiful, you will not be disappointed. Treat yourself, and order it for yourself or the woman you love. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful  Bracelet is not too large or small. Looks very real, the stones are amazing and not overpowering where it looks fake. Very durable clasp and the seller took pride in the packaging and service. I am so glad I did not spend hundreds/thousands on a real one where the white gold fades or turns yellow and pay the high pecent mark up these jewelry stores charge. It's a must if your are contemplating on ordering. <end>  4.5 Carat Sterling Silver CZ Tennis Bracelet  For the price, this is a very pretty cz tennis bracelet with a lot of sparkle. It is delicately made, so be sure to be careful when taking in on and off. The center clasp on mine has a tendancy to stick, so I find its helpful if I remember which side of the clasp to push down on. On mine it's the same side as the safety latch. This way you wont be tugging on it as much and since it is fragile don't wear it in bed or bend it much. As with any fragile or delicate piece of jewelry, (which practically goes for all solid gold jewelry now-a-days), you just have to be careful with it and it will last a long time. I recommend cleaning precious metal jewelry once bi-weekly if you wear it daily. Just warm water with a mild dish soap detergent usually works well. I would definately recommend this piece of jewelry to anyone thinking of buying it. Be gentle with it and check the tightness of the side safety clasps as soon as you receive it. If they seem loose at all you can tighten them by gently squeazing the sides in. If the side clasps fit snugly then it shouldn't fall off your wrist. <end>  looks great  Looks beautiful! I have also bought the silver one for a gift. Looks like a more expensive brand. I have been wearing it with both my gold and silver rings and bracelets. I have to not hook it to get the size I wanted but still look great on me. <end>  Sterling Silver Tennis Bracelet  This bracelet is very stiff. Seems like it could break very easily. I'm a bit disappointed. Would like to get a refund but can't find the receipt. <end>  tennis bracelet  purchased this bracelet for my granddaughter and both she and I were extremely pleased with it. It was certainly well worth the money and looks like it cost muchmore. <end>  It's stuck on my wrist! literally  Starting with the positive. As someone who has very thin wrists, this is the perfect fit. I lost my "real" tennis bracelet due to a faulty clasp and got this to replace it and it's an exact match. However, on with the negative. I'm stuck in it! Have no fear of losing this one, once you fasten the clasp, it's not going anywhere. I've been trying for a half an hour, unsuccessfully, to get this off my wrist. I may be returning just because the clasp is SO bad. That is, if it doesn't break while trying to get it off my wrist. So....I don't know if I'd recommend, its a great bracelet, pretty, great short length but the clasp is beyond words! ruins the whole deal *edit* I have had three people in my office try to remove this from my wrist....still no luck! help! <end>  4.5 Carat Sterline Silver CZ Tennis Bracelet  Very beautiful bracelet and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a very dainty CZ bracelet. <end>  Nice bracelet  Quality seemed just fine. My girl enjoys it. It is a bit large for her wrist. She's 5'6" and it is a bit loose. But it looks realistic. <end>  BEAUTIFUL!  We love this item. I was not disapointed and neither was my wife. it is so beautiful. It fits wonderfully and it look fantastic on her. She wants me to buy another so that if this one ever breaks she will have a spare. wonderful quality from this product. <end>  great bracelet, great service  I purchased this on a thursday afternoon and recieved it on a monday with standard shipping (California). The items was as pictured if not prettier! <end>  Excellent product  The product was gorgeous - I wanted a bracelet that I can wear practically anywhere and this was it. It goes well with casual outfits but also goes just as well with semi formal attire; you can easily dress it up or down. Very quick delivery - received it within 3 days and I only used standard shipping. I was not dissapointed - excellent. <end>  Beautiful, Delicate Piece  I bought this to add a little glamour to my days. It's not too much to wear during the day because it's delicate and small. It looks great with jeans and a t-shirt OR when you want to get dressed up. Have fun with it! <end>  Great Bracelet!  This is a really beautiful bracelet. It looks so real, you would never know it is cz. It is the perfect size to be belivable. It is so sparkely and shiny. I wear it every day and get so many compliments. I highly reccommend this bracelet, you wont be disappointed! <end>  It's pretty!!!  I bought this item hoping for the best and I got it. It is very sparkly yet not gaudy due to its delicate size. I would suggest this to anyone looking for a cheaper alternative to such a classic piece of jewelry. Shipping was really quick to Hawaii and the item came in a jewelry box and bubble wrapped. <end>  cool bracelet  I thought it would be bigger, but after seeing it, its hard to tell that its not diamonds. I had to tell my wife that I didn't deplete the savings account.(I know, a jeweler would not be fooled). It looks great & was shipped faster than promised.I would recommend this seller for these purchases. It is holding up very well. <end>  Gorgeous tennis bracelet!  I wear this beautiful bracelet everyday! It sparkles like crazy and compliments my engagement ring and my diamond watch very nicely. I am thrilled with this purchase, and you will be, too! ;-) <end>  Even the clasp gives it the illusion of real diamonds!  I gotta admit it. After reading the reviews I still was skeptical, but this little bracelet is exactly as described and as appears in the pic. It is delicate, but NOT cheap looking. The length is good. The clasp is one of those lock on clasps that you always get with expensive bracelets. This gives it more credibility that it is real. Hey, what girl doesn't want to show off a pretty sparkly piece of jewelry that looks like the real deal....AND not pay much for it. At this price, treat yourself! <end>  Beautiful bracelet--horrible clasp.  This bracelet is absolutely beautiful--much more brilliant and striking than I expected! However, the clasp is horrible. The clasp came undone and the bracelet slipped off my girlfriend's wrist (unfortunately in a busy public area...) the day I gave it to her. It really was tragic.However, it was such a beautiful bracelet for such a great price, I think I might order a replacement for her, and then try to figure out how to make the clasp more reliable.This product would definitely get 5 stars if the clasp were better. <end>  broken links  For $30 I guess you shouldn't expect too much and although it was nice looking when it arrived, after a few months of wear a link went bad and the clasp started having some issues (part of the clasp broke off). So at first people did think it was real but after it started going south it just looked like a piece of junk jewelry. Too cheap to bother getting it fixed, easier to just buy another. <end>  disappointed  bracelet is beautiful -believeable, cz's are very sparkly. It compliments my current jewelry. However, the bracelet was returned within the week I had it. there's a prong broken off, and another piece that is unsoldered and will eventually break. <end>  Tennis Bracelet  This bracelet is very beautiful and sparkles just like real diamonds. I just love it. <end>  Awesome  i got this for my gf i expected it to be..about a middle range product but it turned out to be a very nice bracelet i was surprised esp. for the price. A great but i would recommend this item... <end>  Nice for a Couple Times  I bought this so I wouldn't have to worry about "real" jewelry at my wedding. It's a nice piece; however, one side of the clasp does not stay. I squeezed it a bit and it was better but it did not stay on all night ... after the pictures, I didn't care ... Still worth it for this type of wear. It would take minor adjustment to fix the clasp; however, we shouldn't have to fix something, no matter what the price. <end>
 B0006OGF5O  Mens Motorcycle Bike Biker Chain Titanium Link Bracelet ||	  Titanium Link Biker Chain  This is a beautiful bracelet but it only comes in one size. Most jewelry stores will not size this bracelet due to the degree of difficulty. One was willing to try but did not promise good results.Manufacturer does not make different sizes and is unwilling to re-size-probably for the same reason as the jewelry stores.The vendors selling this bracelet are excellent to deal with. So if you want to try the item out at least you have the opportunity to do so without the hassle of return. <end>  Cool enough for my brother-in-law/biker-in-law  I bought this for my brother-in-law, a hardcore Harley fan. It is cool, since it's a bike chain, and it has an upscale look. The titanium has a nice lustre and is lightweight. I am not worried about resizing the bracelet for him, as he is incredibly handy and will do it himself. Nice bracelet! <end>  Excellent!  absolute high quality, quick shipping! I go this bracelelt as a birthday gift an now he wont ever take ir off. Thank you so much! <end>
 B0006OGORI  MAGNIFICENT GOLD OCEAN GEMS Designer Sterling Silver Biwa Pearl, Pearl Bracelet ||	  I couldn't be happier  The item is stunning and the craftmanship is excellent. A real buy for those interested in top quality jewelry. My hardy recommendation for this as a gift for a loved one or a treat for yourself. It was shipped in a timely manner as promiced I am completely pleased in every way. <end>
 B0006OJ4UM  Sterling Silver Pentagram on Black Onyx Donut Pendant ||	  Lovely pendant!  This is a beautiful piece! It's much lighter weight than the Sodalite that I had prior to this one. I feel much safer wearing this one without worrying about it breaking the chain. I do wonder about the quality of the onyx being that it is so lightweight, but it is a truly lovely piece! <end>  Just tryin to help.  I am only trying to save money for anyone who is interested in this item. the Onyx is beautiful, and smoothly cut, however the pendent is very cheaply made, and poorly crafted. the design of this item causes the onyx to spin making scratches in the mineral. while it is a comfortable weight, but only due to the low quality material that it was made from. <end>  Beautiful Pendant!  I ordered the pendant Wed. and it arrived Sat. I thought it would be smaller but it is a perfect size, bigger than a quarter. The onyx donut and the face are not attached, so either one is replaceable. The picture does not do the pedant justice. It really is a unique piece of jewelery for the price. Thanks to Silver Sanity and Amazon. <end>  Really nice, hubby loved it!  I bought this as a gift for my Wiccan DH and he loved it. It's a nice size and weight, very nice craftmanship, more than worth the money. He wears it every day, even in the shower, and it still looks perfect. I just wish I had also purchased a chain from Silver Insanity because their jewelry is so nice, and the cheap one my husband is using isn't holding up as well as the pendant is. So buy a chain at the same time! <end>  Very nice  The pendant has alot of class it is not too big it is rather small if your looking for a large pentagram this is not for you but it is well made and discreet.I would advise to buy the chain from silver insanity too so it all arrives in the same delivery . <end>
 B0006OJ4ZM  Heavy Sterling Silver Fat Piggy Hog 3D Pig Pendant or Charm ||	  Year of the Pig!  I ordered the "Heavy Sterling Silver Fat Piggy Hog 3D Pendant" from Silver Insanity and I must say, it is beautiful! I purchased this pendant for a friend and she loves it! The Piggy pendant is finely crafted and detailed and weighty (indicating good quality)! <end>
 B0006OJ57Y  Sterling Silver Detailed Fairy Amethyst Point Pendant ||	  A very wonderful pendant indeed.  It's a good pendent and wonderfully detailed all the way around. Her arms reach above her head to form the hole you run the necklace or cord through. The stone has nice color but feels in the way. Also, the length is a bit long for my tastes. <end>  just as you see  It's just like the picture. Stone color and detail just the same as seen. Size is bigger then an avrage bottle cap, it was a good choice and made the person who got it happy =) <end>
 B0006OJ58S  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Armor Half Finger Ring size 6 ||	  The Picture Is What You Get!  This review is going to be short and sweet, the picture is what you get. The ring is stylish and simple and goes with anything silver. The black allows it to match with whatever my wife wairs and has real good thickness and heavy weight so its not flimsy and definately won't bend when my wife keeps tapping her fingers on the desk or table ;) I personaly think its got a very classy look. <end>
 B0006OJ6BO  Victorian Engraveable Poison Sterling Silver Ring Size 8(Sizes 6,7,8,9,10) ||	  perfect.  When I recieved the ring in the mail I was not disappointed at all. It was in perfect condition, fit good, the clasp opened wonderfully and had beautiful detailing on it. <end>  Fabulous!  The ring is beautiful! Exactly what I expected - and more! Shipping was great! Would definitely purchase again! Thank you! <end>
 B0006OJ72C  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Marcasite Band Ring Size 6.5(Size 6,8,9) ||	  Love it more than expected  I wasn't expecting to, but I love this ring so much I might order another one as "back-up" in case it's lost. It's a lot shinier and more elegant than the photo shows, with more contrast between the silver and black striped areas. Beautiful and unique. <end>  Gorgeously beautiful  This is an absolutely beautiful ring. The onyx is bright and the design is clear and pretty. I am very pleased also at its size. <end>  Great everyday ring  I purchased this ring for my finicky 17 year old daughter.....she loves it and wears it always. No disappointment here. <end>
 B0006OL6HQ  DAZZLING INTENSE YELLOW GREEN Designer Sterling Silver Peridot Pendant ||	  Gorgeous pendant  This pendant is breathtaking in it's design, color and flash. A truly unique piece and a staple item in my jewelry wardrobe. Once again, I just can't say enough good things about these products. <end>
 B0006OMQ84  Sterling Silver Classic Celtic Knot Cuff Bracelet ||	  Pretty but flimsy  This is beautiful cuff, but is such pure silver that it bends when you attempt to tighten/loosen it or accidentally snag it on anything. Good for a night out but not for everyday. <end>
 B0006OMQ8Y  Sterling Silver Honey Bee Green Aventurine Earrings ||	  Gorgeous. The picture really does these no justice.  The bees are incredibly detailed--you can see their little eyeballs! Shipped insanely quickly, and they're even in a pretty bag for the gift-wrap challenged. Every vein in the wings is meticulously made! The stones attract light in a way the picture can't convey. They are extremely delicate-looking, but pleasingly solid in your hand. Far beyond my hopes and probably going to wow the recipient. I'll be re-visiting this seller for more shiny things. Buy them! She'll love them! <end>
 B0006OMQHK  Dog Tag Sterling Silver 2.2mm Bead Chain Necklace - Engraveable (Lengths 20",24") ||	  long silver chain  loved this chain. i wear it with a gorgeous locket. people always comment when i wear it. i wear it all the time. very strong and shiny. <end>  piece of worthless crap  i loved this product at first, it was the perfect length chain though the dog tag charm appears much larger than it really is in real life. i also loved the how it could wrap around your neck twice...but when it arrived that was also not the case. but even that i could deal with- the freaking thing broke the very first night i wore it...the clasp, which was not a lobster clasp as advertised but the traditional army style clasp, fell off completely like i mean it just all broke...do not purchase from this vendor ever again <end>  Wonderful  I bought three different necklaces from this seller and Love them all. What you see is what you get and that is not always true for some places but it is for this seller. You will love what you buy!!! <end>
 B0006OT916  Sterling Silver Marcasite Red Garnet Heart Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Cute for Teen Girl  This ring from Silver Insanity was shipped uber fast! It came in the condition as shown, although the garnet is a little more brown red than the stone pictured. So, of course, stone quality varies. It is sturdy and not chinzy feeling. I'd feel confident purchasing from them again, and my gift recipient will love it. <end>  Beatiful Ring  When I got this ring yesterday, I was so happy. The heart and the stone in it are just the right size (not too big or too small), and it looks much more expensive than it is. It's just beautiful. <end>  very nice  This is the second year I bought celtic jewelry and my wife just adores it. For the price this stuff cannot be beat and will last if u don't ruffhouse it. Yes I like it much and I think i'll buy some for me. <end>
 B0006OT952  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Worry Spin Ring(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12,13) ||	  You get what you pay for...  Not exactly what I expected. The inner celtic knotwork actually is detached from the ring and spins. I found that the knotwork is poorly carved though only I would notice unless someone examined the ring closely. Nice and shiney though and very inexpensive. Would make a cheap good gift for others. <end>  Nice Ring  I was told that the wide of this ring was 3/8" and was 1/4" I realize about that until I received it. I didn't get what I wanted. The ring its ok. <end>
 B0006SE15G  Magical Gothic Pewter Dragon Pentagram Talisman Future Scrying Pendant Necklace ||	  Loved It!  I love this necklace. It is VERY STURDY and it is totally worth it. I've had it for about a year or so now and I still love it and it has never broken. <end>  Pretty awesome!  This necklace isnt my favorite one in my collection, but I do like it a lot. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just not as pretty as some of the others on this website in my opinion. This also arrived with the white orb thing the dragon is cradling broken off. Some super glue fixed that right up and ive had no problems since. Very awesome, but not my absolute favorite <end>  VERY PLEASED  I just wanted to let you know that that I was very pleased on the quality and timely fashion that I recieved this product. I purchased this product as a Birthday gift. I plan on purchasing more products from Silver Insanity.Thank you for your good Service.Debbye McGee <end>  Pretty  I actually ordered this for my son who is a dragon aficionado. He really likes it. It's very pretty and sturdy. We're happy with it. I'd filch it from him and wear it anytime! <end>
 B0006SE1HO  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Armor Band Ring Size 9(Sizes 5,6,6.5,7,8,8.5,9) ||	  The Picture Is What You Get!  This review is going to be short and sweet, the picture is what you get. The ring is stylish and simple and goes with anything silver. The black allows it to match with whatever my wife wairs and has real good thickness and heavy weight so its not flimsy and definately won't bend when my wife keeps tapping her fingers on the desk or table ;) I personaly think its got a very classy look. <end>
 B0006SE1OW  Genuine Rainbow Moonstone and Violet Iolite Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Awesome design!  These earrings are very interesting! I like them a lot. But one of the earrings is a little loose because the gemstones have a hinge connecting them together. <end>  Rainbow Moonstone/Iolite Earrings  I didn't realize I hadn't reviewed this item. I love the earrings. I lost one at a friend's house and found it 4 MONTHS LATER. I guess they were meant to be mine! <end>
 B0006SE1YC  Large Exotic BLUE LAPIS Beaded Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Gorgeous earrings!  I love chandelier earrings, and I don't have one that has lapis lazuli yet. So, when I saw this on sale for about $20, I ordered it right away, taking advantage of the free shipping (for orders over $45).It's just gorgeous! If you're not used to lapis lazuli, you might think that the beads aren't real, that they're fake because of the white streaks. But lapis lazuli is like that. And just to make sure, I compared it with my lapis lazuli pendant, scratched the beads with my nails and against each other, and NOTHING came off. I'm sure I got the real thing (kinda risky buying jewelry online, even if it's not 24k gold or real diamonds).The silver work is intricately done too. But when you wear it, it isn't as heavy as I thought it would be.If you like chandelier earrings, or like wearing big earrings (especially if you have long or big hair), this is for you! You won't worry about your earrings not showing. Of course some women with short hair-cuts pull it off well too. That would show-off the earrings even more! Either way, these earrings simply draw attention to one's face.Don't wear it while dancing hiphop or something that requires you to be all over the floor though. The hooks have no locks, so you might lose one or both earrings! (Trust me; I was stupid enough to wear it in my dance class. Not more than 30 minutes later, I noticed one earring was missing. Thank goodness my classmate found it and gave it back to me.) Non-competative ballroom dancing is fine. =)Bonus  my orders from the seller arrived earlier than expected (3 days after ordering it on a weekend). So, standard free shipping doesn't necessarily mean 2 weeks! <end>
 B0006SE2QO  Sterling Silver Baby Feet Footprints Spin Ring(Sizes 4,5,5.5,6,6,6.5,7,7.5,8,8.5) ||	  Nice Ring  I love this ring. This is a nice heavy ring, it spins nicely & is really cute, well worth the money. I think mine was a 2ND as some of the feet were "smeared" but I didn't care & kept it rather than contacting the company. I've had a lot of complaments on it. <end>
 B0006SJQD8  Sterling Silver Green Stone Malachite Medieval Armor Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  very cool ring  This ring looks exactly like the picture. Very comfortable. Has a cool gothic look. Good quality. I would recommend. <end>
 B0006SJQUG  Sterling Silver Dragon Serpent Aqua Aura Crystal Pendant ||	  Beautiful  This is a BEAUTIFUL pendant. Its a nice size also, 2 inches long. Stone is a very pretty blue. I Love mine. <end>  Awesome pendent!  My boyfriends got me this for my birthday and I absolutely love it! It's gorgeous! The crystal is lovely and after purifying provides wonderful energy! ^_^ I'm a big fan of dragons so it was all around a wonderful gift! Is exactly as displayed. <end>
 B0006SJRVO  Sterling Silver AMETHYST Armor Ring Size 9.5 ||	  A Stunning Ring  Very beautiful ring that fits like a class ring. It's big, but not too big. It has a unique design and it's shiny. I just purchased it and I'm very happy with it. Silver Insanity has a variety of quality jewelry to choose from and they provide excellent customer service with each transaction. I recommend this ring. <end>  AMAZING!!!  This ring is extremely beautiful, I wear it all the time, and the only thing that would make it even better would be if it came in a size 4!  D I have to wear it on my middle finger, and it even fits my left thumb...and that's a 5! The Amethyst makes this ring so perfect! <end>
 B0006SJT62  Sterling Silver Wavy Knight Armour Band Ring ||	  Perfect!!  I love this ring! I've sat on the internet countless hours. Looking for any company that could compare to the beautiful styles this company creates. There aren't any! My only gripe is they don't do half sizes in anything larger than a 6 and they've discontinued one of my favorite designs. <end>
 B0006SW2Y8  Surgical Steel Domed 9mm Wedding Band Ring Tribal Gecko Cut-outs Matte Finish Comfort-Fit, sizes 7 - 14 ||	  Serious Problem with Delivery (or lack thereof)!  ABSOLUTELY NOT SATISFIED WITH SABRINA SILVER. This product was ordered on October 22, 2010 together with two other sellers. All the other shipment arrived within 7 days from the date of order. Only this one is still missing. When I asked them (Sabrina Silver) what happened, they just said that the shipment must be with the local customs here in Hong Kong. Mind you, I wasn't born yesterday. If the shipment is still with the local custom, how come all the other shipments (they were actually rings & accessories also) arrived so swiftly and NOT this one? To top it off, they charged my credit on October 23, 2010 already. Although this seller Sabrina Silver has quite an impressive track record in delivering their goods, my shipment is actually contrary to public belief. Case still not resolved at this time. <end>  Picture does no justice....  I bought this ring as a gift and I was a little unsure on how it was going to look, but when I received it met all my expectations. <end>  Really great and fun ring  This ring is very nice. The steel is nice and thick. It's 9MM wide, which I like also, but the steel band itself is very thick. It's a substantial ring. And it's a lot of fun with the lizard design which much have been cut with a laser because it is so precise. I will definitely order more of these rings. <end>  Lovely Lizard Link  Great design, great price, great delivery. Will buy another for the boyfriend.Only caveat, most jewelers will not re-size surgical steel rings. <end>  cool dude  they are durbale and is best for guys and gals that are hard on there jewerly and what something differnt <end>  very cool ring  i love this ring its so coooool i wear it as a thumb ring. and i just love everything about it  ) <end>  Great as a thumb ring!!  I absolutely love this ring!! I wear it 24/7, through many showers and lotion and it holds up strong!! Still looks shiny!! I get many compliments on the ring too! I would recommend this as a fun ring to wear! Shipping was prompt! Thank you!! <end>  For my mom.  I gave this ring to my mom because she loves geckos, and she Absolutely loves it. It is beautiful I'm even shopping for one for myself. <end>  Nice Ring  I'm very happy with this purchase. The lizard design is clean cut and precise. The ring is not nearly as hefty as I expected, but still has a nice presence on my finger. Sizing is right on, fits perfectly. <end>  LOVE THIS RING  I BOUGHT THIS RING FOR MY BOYFRIEND FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. IT FIT PERFECTLY AND HE LOVES IT AND WEARS IT ALL THE TIME. <end>  Great Artest... BUT  All of her products are wonderful and look great on anyone BUT as I have a small hand and fingers I would have bought more, Mens and womans rings if my size were available ( size 6 or 7 ). Over all I know I will be a repeat customer. <end>  100% Recommended  These laser cut rings look fantastic and are very comfortable. I plan on getting more. <end>

 B0006U7VRY  Gold Star Italian Charm ||	  Star Charm  Within the month the gold has wore off the star on the charm. Good price on the charm, but hoped for a bit better quality. <end>
 B0006U7VVA  Breast Cancer Italian Charm ||	  color coming off  I've only had this charm for a few weeks and the red seems to be coming off <end>
 B0006UGIQE  .925 Sterling Silver Polished Finish Braided Toe Ring ||	  cute but uncomfortable  this item serves it's purpose as a toe ring, but the edges are bit sharp and pinch my toe when i walk no matter which way i try to wear it or fit it. i'm used to the pinching by now, so i wear it anyhow!! <end>  Very cute  Very cute and very comfortable. I have worn it practically nonstop since I got it about four months ago. I wear it under shoes, and no problem, And it hadn't turned green, LOL. <end>  Toe Ring  i like the toe ring, it is very pretty, i just wish the design was all the way around. i thought it was from the picture <end>  stylish little toering!  This is a great little ring. Looks just like the picture. It's sturdy so you don't have to worry about breakage or too much bending out of shape. I love it. <end>
 B0006V1OK8  Jade Quartz Fireball Navel Bar 14 gauge by 3/8" in length ||	  Classy and comfortable  The wonderful size and coloring of this ring, makes it dressy enough to wear out, but it is comfortable enough to sleep in. I was impressed by the high quality of this piece. <end>
 B0006V4AKE  Emerald Green Lucky Clover Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Cute, eventually fell apart  This belly ring is very cute, but after a while it began to tarnish and the clover broke off. It just didn't last as long as I thought it should. (Only wore it about a month) <end>  Lovey little Irish luckcharm  I am happy to report that this product is as cute in person as it is on the site. I can say they sent it very quickly, and I have had no trouble with the product. <end>
 B0006V4BVM  SWAROVSKI Pink Gem SPARKLING SPIDER Belly Ring ||	  sad!  ordered this spider, never came in the mail...contacted seller and said one was on the way....never came. <end>
 B0006V4BYE  SWAROVSKI Purple REVERSIBLE RIVETING Crystal ID TAG Belly Ring ||	  Good idea but bad execution  This ring is supposedly designed so that you can wear it with the tag hanging down (as shown) or in the reverse with the tang hanging from the top. In the latter position, the tag is quite heavy and the slightest motion causes the ring to protrude up which stretches the hole a great deal and makes it very easy to snag or see through clothing. In the position pictured, the ring will not fit at all in any size piercing because the tag is actually curved and bows out. The barbell is not long enough to accommodate this curve and the tag will either pull the ring out or flip over so it is upside down. Certainly not worth 19.99 nor even 1.99. <end>
 B0006VQUFM  Ladies 3 Carat Diamond 14KT White Gold Tennis Bracelet ||	  Happy Mom  Boy did I score a lot of points with this purchase, Mom loved it as soon as she opened the package. Another great purchase from Amazon. Love the review system that helps you make a decision. <end>  My wife was happy  A gift for our first kid. The price was great. My wife was happy. Great buy. <end>
 B0006VSN98  Hypnotic Swirls Designer Sterling Silver Pendant ||	  stunning !  This large piece will attract attention and envious glances. It is well graced with good design and quiet beauty. Enjoy it for years to come and then make it a splendid generation gift. mclg <end>
 B0006YY7MM  Pugster I Heart Gay Men Italian Charm Bracelet ||	  My social life has gotten better now that i have this charm  I love this charm! I wear it around my neck and many people have complimented me. I've even hooked up with my roommate, Graydon, because he was afraid of coming out. He saw my charm and BAM it was on like Donkey Kong. Paintball practice is even more steamy and exciting now as well, ;) and Junior, our other teammate, just can't get enough of it.It feels so good to be out!i &lt;3 gay men! <end>  WARNING!  WARNING! I made a purchase from this seller who shipped me something I didn't want (the description said "bracelet" but that was *not* what they sent). Upon returning the item I was not refunded any shipping costs, despite the fact that the ad said the item was a "bracelet" and that is *not* what they sent me.Do they made a profit from the $2.50 shipping charge for sending me some tiny little piece of metal? (it cost me only $0.83 to send it back). I will NEVER buy from these people again, please make a better choice than I did! <end>
 B0006YY7RW  Pugster Lil Sis Brother & Sister Italian Charm ||	  Just what I ordered  I bought the lil sis and big sis charms for my nieces who are about to have girl number 5 join the family. They were extremely pleased with them. They came in a timely manner after I ordered them and seemed to be in great condition. The girls had them on their bracelets that night and had already started one for the baby sis. Makes a great gift for including sisters in a baby shower. <end>
 B0006Z0TZK  Ladies 5 Carat Tennis Bracelet ||	  Love it!  I treated myself to his diamond bracelet. I received it quickly and the bracelet was BEAUTIFUL. No certification came with it but happy with the purchase. Plan to updrade in the future and would use Sunset again. <end>
 B0006Z15JO  Earspiral Earrings 1S 14K Solid Rose Gold ||	  Love them!  I absolutely love these rose gold earrings. They are a perfect size and very light. I love that I don't have to worry about losing them. They are beautiful! I highly recommend them! <end>  Spiral Earrings IS 14 Kt Rose Gold  The earrings are unique but very "flimsy". I haven't worn them yet and truly hope they will stand up to normal wear. I will keep them for several reasons...1) Harry Mason guarantees them 2) I like the style 3) I need the Rose Gold 4) they are unique. Besides the extremely light weight of the solid 14 Kt. Gold, I think the price was a bit high. I would not have purchased them if I had to pay the additional $7.95 that Harry Mason charges for s/h...thanks Amazon for that perk. <end>  Earspiral Rose Gold Earings  I received the gold ones in this same design and absolutely loved them so I HAD to get the rose gold to go with all my rose gold jewelry. You just can't beat them, they hang beautifully from my ears and are the perfect length. Not to long, not to thick & just enough weight and body to them that they dangle nicely. <end>  The impossible is possible  I loved the earrings when I received them. I still like the design. BUT....one fell off. Yes, the "impossible to fall off" earring did just that. NEVER say "NEVER." Sadly, I have another single earring to add to my collection of single earrings. <end>  Golden earrings  The product is just how it looks in the picture, I can wear them with a lot of things and look nice and discreet. <end>  Very beautiful earrings!!  I bought these earrings for my wife for our 10th anniversary. She really loved them. Beside the special structure you just thread it throw your ear. No studs and hard to loose. Very recommended. The only thing that was missing is a nice box (not provided). Anyway the earrings get 5 stars. <end>  spiral earrings  Loved them would purchase more items from this vendor. They were exactly as portrayed on line. I would definitely buy more from them. <end>  Unique earrings  Like these earrings because they're unique. HOWEVER, you still have to be careful about them falling out. Bent over to get some plates out of the dishwasher for dinner and found one of the earrings staring me in the face! So glad the plate was there to catch it as it fell out. <end>
 B0006Z3HMW  Bracelet Buddy ||	  decent way  a very neat and decent way to put things together, what i like is the fact that i have some pieces that is so hard to clasp and with this one, i wont have to worry anymore! very nice thinking... <end>  bracelet buddy rocks  the wife says it works great so all is well . good product even how simple the device is. good purchase,thanks. <end>  no more needed help  my husband always had to help me with my bracelets so when i found this it was a must have. very easy to use even though its all plastic but did as stated. <end>  Bracelet buddy  I am still learning to use the bracelet buddy, but I do like it. With my arthritic hands I have a difficult time fastening hooks. <end>  handy item  Purchased as a gift for a friend who was having problems putting on braclets by herself. Pretty enough to leave out on your dressing table. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  The product works great and is of good quality. I no longer have to ask a friend to put my bracelet on for me. <end>  Bracelet Buddy...So Simple...So Helpful!!!  For a simple little piece of plastic (that is actually kind of cute), this has been so helpful!!! I needed it for my Trollbead bracelet (which would mean it would probably help out you Pandora, Camilla, and other bracelet folk, too). The beads are so heavy on my Trollbead bracelet that the bracelet tended to pull off my wrist while I was trying to latch it. Plus, the beads make the bracelet a bit tighter as well, which makes latching tough. I just could NOT get this bracelet on without help (and sometimes, no one's around!). In fact, I even resorted to a trick my friend told me to try by putting a piece of floss through the ringlet loop and holding the floss between my teeth while I latched it. It worked, but the floss would sometimes slip (not to mention I was worried about my teeth...and also not to mention that is just looked weird).   )Needless to say, the bracelet buddy makes a simple thing like latching one's own bracelt so much easier! No problems now. This is quite a helpful little gadget. <end>  wonderful  I'v had a similar one for years and just purchased this for my daughter-in-law and she loves it. She told me everyone who sees it wants one. I plan to purchase several more for my daughter and some friends also. I couldn't live without mine. <end>  Couldn't Live Without It!  This simple little gadget is the best thing since sliced bread! I love it and it works like a charm. <end>  Disappointing  Unfortunately, the clamp and teeth are too big to easily catch and hold the smaller rings of a bracelet. Wish I had bought the other kind that I know now works better. Just thought this would make a nice little gift for a friend and to have an extra one for me. Sadly, not worth returning them... <end>  great  This gadget helps immensely when trying to put on bracelet. A little to fragile feeling, afraid it will snap easily. <end>  Terrible product!  A cheap piece of plastic! The worst thing I ever purchased  ( It does not work and is already falling apart! <end>  Will not hold  The clamp part is cheap plastic and will not hold the bracelet when trying to put the clasp together. I would never recommend this. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  Bought this because I have trouble hooking bracelets and some watches. It is easy to use and definitely makes hooking bracelets and watches easier. However it doesn't hook tightly so you have to be careful to not pull on it as it will unhook. <end>  Great gift  My mom has not been up to her usual speed, so I thought this would be a great gift for someone losing some of their mobility. So far she said it's been great and that she used to have trouble getting some of her jewelry on and this solved that issue. I liked the idea that it's plastic and won't scratch expensive jewelry. So far this is well worth the money and a great present from me! Patting myself on the back! <end>  Awkward  Maybe I just need more practice, but am having a hard time clasping my bracelets with this gizmo. The alligator clasp comes off pretty easily if you grab your bracelet the wrong way. I guess I'll just keep asking my husband to do this for me. <end>  great help  This bracelet buddy has been a great help with putting my numerous bracelets on. And even thought it is plastic it has held up very well <end>  Ok, but a little cheap  The clip that holds the bracelets in place is plastic, and has come apart on me a few times. It is somewhat sturdy, and I have been using it to put on my heavy Pandora bracelets for over a year now. <end>  bracelet buddy  purchased it for my wife i lost most feelings in my hands can't help her with her jewelery this was a real hit <end>  Perfect Little Helper  Item arrived promptly, was exactly as advertised, and works perfectly on hard-to-maneuver bracelet clasps. After one or two practice tries, the process is smooth and quick. Reasonable price. <end>  Good Product  This product really helps when trying to put your bracelet on without help from another person. <end>  great item  This is a fantastic item.. I should have purchased one years ago.. I can now put on bracelets that I used to have to take to work and ask for help with.LOVE IT... I will probably buy another one to keep at work for when I want to take a bracelet off before going to the gym and put it back on before heading home. <end>  Nice tool but...  Nice tool that works well. The but is that it did not come with a carrying case as advertised. <end>  finally some help  Finally something to help with bracelets,worth every penny if you wear bracelets. Good retailer, fast shipping. <end>  Really enjoying my Bracelet Buddy  This is such an helpful item, whether you have arthritis or not! It took a couple of attempts to figure out the best way to use this but once I figured it out, it was a snap. <end>  Helper  I already owned one of these and recommended it for a friend. That is who it was ordered for and she is pleased with the item. <end>  So easy  I had a terrible time putting on my Pandora bracelet, and asking hubby to help every time was getting to be a pain. The Bracelet Buddy is so easy to use, I can put my bracelet on with ease and absolutely no human help. My Pandora bracelet is now a part of my daily wear. Thank you so much!! <end>  Useless  The clip is designed to hold the ringlet, but only has teeth on one side. As you maneuer it into place and try to get a hold of the clasp to open it, the ringlet invariably slips free of the clip and you must start all over again. I'm right handed and was trying to put the bracelet on my left wrist. After failing a half a dozen times, I decided to try it on my right wrist. It didn't work any better. Save your money and get a friend to help you put on your bracelet. <end>  bracelet buddy  This is the cheapest product I have ever purchased. I expect it to last for 1 use. The picture makes it look expensive but it is a plastic piece of junk and is not worth the price. It might be worth $1.00 in a Dollar Store. <end>  cant believe amazon sells this  This product is grossly represented. No carrying case or instructions. Made of cheap plastic including the clasp which i would be surprised of it even works. I had a metal one but umfortunately lost it. Not even worth the trouble of returning. <end>  Very handy  This is a pretty decent item for attaching bracelets. My only gripe is that the plastic grip does not always hold on to the edges of bracelets properly, so it sometimes slips off (although gripping links between bracelets seems to alleveate that.) I would recommend it to anyone who loves bracelets but have a little problem putting them on. <end>  Great item  I gave this to my sister for her birthday and she loves it. She wears bracelets all the time and this bracelet buddy is a great help. I have one that is similar and I use it every time I wear a bracelet. One thing I like about this one is that the part that holds the bracelet is plastic and will not scratch the jewelry. Mine is older and has metal teeth that I had to cover with tape. I highly recommend this item. <end>  Simple, but nifty little device....  Such a simple concept, but this little thing totally works. My silver rolo link Tiffany bracelet is so easy to put on now (I would usually give up in frustration!) A terrific, inexpensive solution. <end>  Works Quite Well  I originally searched out this product for my 87 yr old mother-in-law who found it nearly impossible to put on her jewelry, but quickly realized the wisdom of ordering one for myself, too. The Bracelet Buddy works pretty well, and allows me to fasten my own bracelets instead of needing to ask my husband for help all the time. I have arthritis in my hands, but I am still able to use it effectively.On the downside, I have one bracelet whose clasp design is such that the Bracelet Buddy doesn't hold it very well, meaning I still struggle with that particular piece. Also, the fancy handle is plastic and, to my way of thinking, too light and kind of cheezy for the price. But, I don't plan on putting it in a display cabinet so I guess that part doesn't matter. <end>  huge help  I can't live without this thing -- well, that's an exaggeration, but I can't put bracelets on without it!Great concept and a big help! <end>  Cheaply made  I have had the Bracelet Buddy for several weeks now and I still cannot get it to work. I think part of the problem is that the alligator clip is plastic, instead of metal, and it doesn't get a good grip on the bracelet. I have wrapped a rubber band around the clip in the hope that it will hold it closed better. I haven't given up on it yet but I am very disappointed. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  This item is indespensable for any lady who loves to wear bracelets. With this you can actually get your bracelets on WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE helping you. Even if you've become pretty good at getting your bracelets on by yourself anyway, this item allows you to do it really fast and easy. Older women will especially love it. My mom gave me mine and I liked it so much I bought 6 for my friends.  ) <end>  Bracelet Budd  Short and to the point! I LOVE my bracelet buddy! Ease of use and a great value!! <end>  Bracelet Buddy  This is the best invention ever. I always had a hard time putting on my bracelets in the morning, but this makes it a cinch. <end>  Great for us single gals who don't have someone to help us put our jewelry on.  Great for us single gals who don't have someone to help us put our jewelry on. Now I can do it myself. <end>  Bracelet  Great doing business with you exactly what I wanted now I can wear my bracelets very decorative and eay to use <end>  Cheaply made  This is nothing soecial. It works &#34;ok.&#34; Made of cheap plastic. How much I really like this remains to be seen. <end>  Handy!  I ordered this for my Mom so she could put on her bracelets without help, and its just what she needed. <end>  Great product  Great idea...and it works well. I have several bracelets that I could never fasten by myself. This allows me to do it by myself now with no problem. Love this thing. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  I love this product. It is so handy to use. I was always asking someone to help put my bracelets on & now I can do by myself. <end>  Handy...  Wish it were metal instead of plastic, but it sure does make it possible for a person to put on a braclet without help. <end>  great!  Was just what I expected when I made my order. Could not have been better described and was just as it was reported to be. <end>  Jewelry  The bracelet buddy works ok. I can now put my jewelry on by myself. Very simple to use. I like it. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  I purchased the bracelet buddy because I do have trouble at times putting on some of my braclets with the clasps. This really helps. <end>  This is a lifesaver for me  So hard to put on any bracelet that has a clasp when you live by yourself. I am now wearing bracelets that I haven't been able to wear in a very long time. It does sometimes take me awhile to get it hooked because my eyesight isn't what it used to be but it really is a lifesaver. <end>  I couldn't wear my pandora bracelet without it!  I bought this little helper because I could never wear my bracelet unless someone would hook it and unhook it for me. It has nothing to do with arthritis--the bracelet is just long enough to reach around my wrist and operating the claw clasp was impossible without help. But, this little gizmo works! <end>  Cheap looking but invaluable  Although it looks like a dollar-store item, it works as promised. I have RA/DDD and this is just what I needed to put on my medi-bracelet <end>  Bracelet Buddy  I ordered this bracelet buddy because I have a hard time getting my bracelets on by myself anymore. I used to have one before that was metal and had hope this one was too, but it was not. It is plastic and the teeth do not grip as well as my old metal did, they slip off more times than I like, but it works. The price is good for what it is. <end>  Perfect for Pandora style bracelets  I have a Pandora style bracelet that I used to be able to put on myself. The more beads I added, the more challenging it was to attach alone. This "bracelet buddy" works like a charm! <end>  OK so far  These were purchased as gifts, so I don't know what the quality is really like. The concept is great. I've owned one of this type of thing for years and I love it. The gold turned design is not my style, but the selection of this tool is limited. Delivery and packaging were fine. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  Awesome product, I highly recommend it. I've bought a couple dozen to give as gifts and the recipients love them. <end>  Not worth the money  The bracelet buddy is a good idea, but it doesn't work. The clip isn't strong enough and doesn't hold the bracelet long enough to attach the clasp. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  This Bracelet Buddy is great; I always had a problem with hooking my bracelets and with this product it's on one, two, three! I may just purchase a few more for friends and family. <end>  love it  i love the bracelet buddy but i am afraid it will break easily. i hope not because it really helps me. <end>  Makes clasping braceletes much easier.  This product allows one to manage clasping bracelets without help from another person. Read the directions carefully and have patience. It does work. <end>  Hunk of cheap plastic!  Not worth a cent! No carry case as described in item description. Waste of money! Don't think they'd even sell in a .99 cent store with a clear conscience. <end>  This is a piece of junk....  I don't need to say anything more. They wouldn't let me leave it a rating of no stars, so I have to give it one. <end>  love it but  This is a great device but cheaply made. I accidently dropped it and half the handle broke.Can still use though. Be careful <end>  Cheap Tool But It Works  Made out of very cheap material, but it does work. I do not think it will last long if used often. <end>  Bracelet Buddy OK not great  I still have trouble latching the lobster clasp on my Pandora charm bracelet even with the Bracelet Buddy, but I can do it eventually, so it's an improvement. <end>  MADE IN CHINA---wilth a giant crappy sticker  I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, after seeing a bunch of these at craft fairs for way more money.Honestly, I should have shelled out the extra cash.Do yourself a favor, dont buy this.The product is simply crap.Cheap plastic, cheap spring, and poor design aesthetics. <end>  Unfriendly buddy  On first try this product lost its grip. The black "jaws" simply could not hold the end of the bracelet. Don't buy because you'll be sorry and it is not worth returning because it is poor manufacturing, and the next one you would get would be equally poor. <end>  JUNK  This bracelet holder is the worst excuse for a product I believe I have ever seen. The whole thing only weighs 6/10ths of an ounce. Yes, that is 6/10ths of an ounce. The tip is huge, too huge to use on fine jewelry. This item is cheap, thin plastic, including the tip you hold your bracelet in. Just absolute crap. Doesn't work worth a darn. Please take it off Amazon and don't lower your self to this standard of workmanship. If I could give a zero rating I would. <end>  Junk!  The above ad, line 4, clearly states in the  Product Features -- * Includes handy carrying case and simple instructionsThere was NO "handy carrying case" included (false advertising) with this piece of plastic nonsense. Even the clip is plastic. The spring is too flimsy to hold the end of my bracelet. My husband and I tried it. We think it's junk. I sent it back.The system would not let me enter my review unless I gave it a rating in stars. If not for that there would be no star here. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  Makes putting bracelets on, when the fingers get arthritic, and cannot bend theway they once did, possible! Great insturment. <end>  Don,t waste your money  You would not be able to use it...unless you have great dexterity! Also bracelet wou. Don,tld have to be very loose in order to put clasp on. Don;t waste your money I did.... <end>  A boone for arthritic fingers  This is the perfect answer for someone who has trouble manipulating those pesky bracelet clasps. Now I can put on and remove bracelets with ease. Kudos! <end>  perfect  This was a good product for my future m-i-l, helped her put on the bracelets we all bought her! Quick shipping as well. <end>  bracelet buddy  It is made from cheep plastic, I anticipate it breaking soon, it does not hold chain or clasp very well, mosre awkward to use then seems. <end>  Great little device!!  I have very long nails and can never fasten a bracelet or necklace - this is exactly what I needed - gets it hooked every time in seconds! <end>  Best thing since sliced bread...  I don't know what else I can say except that this product does exactly what I need it to do. I've fought with my bracelets over the years, struggling to get them on. This is the perfect solution; it's simple to use and effective. The plastic clamp doesn't scratch my jewelry but holds onto it just fine. <end>  Perfect!  This shipped very quickly and was just what I thought it would be! The clip is plastic but it still holds the bracelet well enough for me to get my bracelet on. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  The Bracelet Buddy was delivered promptly and I have used it almost daily with my jewelry. As I live alone, it is a tremendous aid with difficult jewelry clasp. Good buy at a very good price. <end>  Simple but it Works  So simple and cheaply made that it makes you smile, but it works. It's an alligator clip on the end of a "designer" plastic tube, but I didn't think of it. My version was a paper clip on a string and this is much, much easier because it holds the clasp in a fixed position. <end>  Useful gadget  This little gadget is so useful -- just hold your bracelet still with the hand you are putting it on and engage the clasp with the other. If you don't have anyone to help, you don't have to give up wearing bracelets!!! So simple and so helpful. <end>  Very Helpful!  This is a great little tool. I have had difficulty in getting my bracelet on and don't like relying on other sor help. The bracelet buddy has solved my issue. Thank you! <end>  Handy little item  Great idea for those of us who are bracelet challenged at times. And for the price, even better! It's a bit awkward at first, just in terms of how to hold it, but it's fine. You do it once, and you don't have to think about it again. Cool tool. <end>  Not easy to use  I have trouble using this product. Perhaps it is me but more often than not I can't get it to do what it's expected to do. <end>  thank you  This is a great item. I have used this many times already. works wonderful. I would recommend it to everyone. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  I really like the Bracelet Buddy, for people who can't use there hands and fingers good anymore its wonderful, we need more gadgets like that. <end>  every lady who likes bracelets  Every lady who likes bracelets and wears them should have one of these. They are the greatest invention since sliced bread!! If there is not someone to hook a bracelet for you, you can struggle to get it clasped. But with this little gadget, you can hook your own and wear a bracelet anytime you want. Definitely a 5 star product !!! <end>  Bracelet buddy  I find the end with the clasp ofter slips. Wish it were more secure, but it definately helps using the clasps on a bracelet <end>  Cheap  This little wand is a really good idea and would work fine if it was made out of more substantial materials, but you are paying WAY too much for cheap plastic. Mine broke in the middle the first time I used it. I think perhaps if the unit didn't have so many smaill thin areas where the little 'beads' meet it would be more worthwhile. <end>  Extremely convienient  Ever since I bought this, I have used it every time I wear a bracelet. It makes it so easy without having to contort my wrists and hands to get a bracelet on. <end>  Good Item just over priced  Items is great, just over priced! easy to use, makes getting my bracelet on mush easier, but thought it was a bit over priced. <end>  Bracelet Buddy  This is a great tool for putting on a bracelet by yourself. No more fumbling to get the clasp in the right position only to have the bracelet slide off your wrist in the opposite direction. Just secure one end of the bracelet with the bracelet buddy, position it on your wrist and bring the other end of the clasp around. Voila!! Your bracelet is on and you're ready to head out the door! I definitely recommend it! <end>  a little cheap, but does the job  I got this secondhand from a relative who had arthritis and has since passed away. I don't think she opened the package, but I have used it several times and it works fine. It does look a little chintzy. As another reviewer said, it can slip from time to time, but putting it between the links seems to stop that. You do have to follow the instructions exactly to get it to work. <end>  LOVE IT !!!  A life saves! It is never easy trying to put bracelet on by yourself, but this little tool is awesome!!! A must have for anyone who wears bracelets! <end>  Love it!  My first impression was that it was a little cheesy. I bought it as a gift for my 78 year old mother who was constantly having problems with putting on her jewelry. Once I tried it myself and realized that if it wasn't plastic you would need 2 hands just to hold it! So, after jumping to conclusions I have to eat my words and say this is one of the best things invented since sliced bread! It is light and easy to use as well has being pretty! <end>  Bracelet buddy  This is absolutely the greatest thing since sliced bread. I no longer rely on someone else to help me with my bracelets. It is great! <end>  BRACELET BUDDY  Previously wrote my review of this product. Subsequent contact with seller Iwill only state "consider this item carefully when ordering, if it is what you desire and feel it will really meet your particular needs and desires.I do thank the seller for their consideration for contacting me, that showscharacter, and effort to please their customers. <end>  Doesn't work  This product didn't work for me the tip is cheap and plastic and it does not clamp on well to jewerly. I sent it back. Ladies find one with a metal tip. <end>  Very cheap quality  I had a nice bracelet helper at one time and after my mother admired it, I gave it to her. I ordered this as a replacement was very disappointed in the quality, especially for the price. It is made of molded, cheap plastic with the seam running down the side. Even the clasp is plastic and feels very fragile. Doesn't grip well either. I expected much better for this price. Not worth the trouble to return, but you can definitely get a better product for the money. <end>  Disappointing  I already reviewed this product, totally disappointed would be very Leary to buy anything else on line. A big waste of money. If anyone cares!!! <end>  works as advertised  I have one omega bracelet that is fairly stiff and impossible to put on if i am alone. This product enabled me to get the bracelet on when ever I feel like it. Great idea! <end>  Nick's raview of bracelet helper  A very versatile product provides ease of locking bracelets without the help of another person. Quite affordable and very good in appearance. One drawback that was noticed was that the clamp does not have a strong enough spring to hold on to the bracelet. <end>  Bracelett Buddy  Bought this for my Sister in law who lives alone and loves to wear braceletts. She loves this because she can put them on with no issues. <end>
 B0006ZLT40  PalmBeach Jewelry 1.19 TCW Flower Cut Genuine Jade Sterling Silver PerI.D.ot Accent Ring ||	  Beautiful  I love this ring. The only thing I would have wanted different is if the petals on the flower were seperate and not one piece. I have had so many compliments on the ring. It's not small and has a grat presense about it. The color is nice and the silver is a great accent as so much in Jade is set in gold. Very nice for the cost. <end>
 B0006ZPB0S  Pretty Diamond-cut Black Hills Gold & Sterling Silver Rose Bud Women's Ring ||	  Beautiful!!!  After 5 years of missing this beautiful ring!! Our oldest daughter accidently flushed my orginal down the drain! It beautiful, doesnt sit too high, and fits great! I love it! Thanks to Amazon.com for such an awesome site! It was a great Valentines gift! <end>  Pretty, Elegant Ring  This ring is everything I expected it to be. It is very pretty, goes with any outfit, stays clean and is easy to take care of. I would recommend this ring to anyone who likes silver and Black Hills gold. <end>
 B0006ZT1XG  Southwestern Native American Handmade Twisted Hoop Earrings in Sterling Silver, #1874 ||	  Nice Product  Just recieved these earrings...They are a little larger than I imagined they would be (approx. 1/2" dia.)..but are really well crafted and cool looking..might be a little too large for most men, but then I'm a bit of a show-off !!! <end>
 B0006ZUG2Q  Pretty Diamond-cut Black Hills Gold & Sterling Silver Rose Bud Women's Ring ||	  Beautiful!!!  After 5 years of missing this beautiful ring!!

It was a great Valentines gift! <end>  Pretty, Elegant Ring  This ring is everything I expected it to be. It is very pretty, goes with any outfit, stays clean and is easy to take care of.

 B00070H10K  Live, Laugh, Love, Dream, Faith, Hope, Truth Inspiration Sterling Silver Affirmation Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Cute but breaks easily  My daughter loves it but we have had to have it fixed twice b/c it has pulled apart. May not be for younger girls <end>
 B000765Y2Q  Platinum Classic Solitaire Engagement Ring Setting ||	  Good Platinum Solitare Setting  I'm not exactly sure how to review an engagement ring setting, but here goes. Its a fairly affordable platinum setting. I bought it as part of the engagement ring for my (now) fiancee. The setting is shiny and heavy just like it should be. Its a little bit on the heavy side, which is a side effect of choosing platinum rather than white gold, but it won't dull as much. My only complaint is that Amazon didn't offer rings in quarter sizes. However, rounding to the nearest half-size didn't make a big difference and the ring looks great on my fiancee's finger. <end>  Great Ring  This is a very nice ring. It is very shiny, and also very $$. Very cool. <end>
 B000769U1M  Pugster Standing Wolf Dogs Italian Charm ||	  Charm Is Not Exactly Like the One Shown  This advertisement shows a beautiful picture of a Grey Wolf, yet the actual charm itself is a picture of only the head. The colors are off from what you see shown here and there is a gold border around the picture. At first I thought the charm was dirty, creating a fuzzyness to the picture but then I realized there are bubbles in the plastic that protects the picture. You get what you pay for, I guess. Just keep in mind this charm is prettier on-line.Added to 09/22/07 - I noticed the price has been changed on this from $2.99 to $20+. Odd, but unless they improved their quality I wouldn't pay their raised price. <end>  Beautiful charm  My grandson collects wolf keepsakes, clothing, books, etc., so I had to include this charm in an Italian charm key chain. The clarity of the picture makes it easier to view, too. <end>
 B00076D8NS  Pugster Christmas Glow Holiday Italian Charm ||	  Christmas charm  Nice, though it looks more "lit" in the descriptive photo than in person, but still a nice addition to my bracelet. Very nice service as well. <end>
 B00076D8R4  Pugster Christmas Maltese Dogs Italian Charm ||	  Charm  I have done business with Pugster before. Never any problems. I am happy, and the service is always great <end>
 B00076EMP6  14k Yellow Gold Pear-Cut Sapphire Engagement Ring Setting (1/3 ct tw) ||	  Very sturdy prongs, excellent Amazon service, versatile ring  I had Amazon put a .39 radiant diamond in this setting.The setting is very classy. I wear it as a right hand ring, that is why I say it is versatile. The .39 size worked very well with the proportions of the ring. My diamond is a radiant but as you can see many other shapes will look splendid too. If you are choosing a conservative diamond, this is the setting for it.I highly recommend this setting and also Amazon jewelers. The customer service is very friendly and they speak clear English. They will help you decide on a diamond based on your parameters. The jeweler will inspect your diamond and if it doesn't live up their expectations Amazon won't sell it to you. Be sure to see my photo of the completed ring. <end>
 B00076MULE  18K gold and steel Italian-Charm " Sewing Machine" ||	  Loved It!  This charm finished my charm bracelet. I make quilts, love to sew so it was perfect for the final charm. My granddaughter likes to look at my charms and can even figure where some of them came from, like Papa got you that one or mommy and daddy did. <end>
 B00076O418  Cloisonne Pill Boxes - Medium, Set of 4 ||	  Rip-Off !  Wow - and I thought only e-bay had the reputation of some sellers raping their customers blind ! I own the two pill boxes pictured on the left ... and they ONLY cost me approximately 4.99 (at Wal Mart or Walgreens - forget which).And to buy these 4, they want FORTY dollars PLUS 7.50 for shipping ?!?!?!?!Check out your local Wal Mart, Walgreens, Drug Mart, etc.etc. FIRST !! Especially around Christmas time - they stock a lot more for the holiday season.ps  This is my first negative review (I feel that strongly about it). Plus, with over 400 items bought on e-bay - I have ONLY left 2 negatives & one neutral .... so, as you can see, it takes a lot to provoke me into a "negative comment". <end>  impractical  OK, I read the review calling this a "Rip Off" and I agree that they are too expensive. But I was willing to pay the price (plus shipping) for 2 sets of what appeared to be beautiful cloisonne pill boxes to give as Christmas bridge gifts to my friends. I am now embarrassed to give them. They are not well made, they are heavy, and they do not open and close easily. I will not be carrying one in my purse, which is what I intended to do. It will probably be another useless trinket to my bridge friends. Maybe I can make it up to them next year. <end>
 B00076O42C  Vermeil, Plique a Jour Dragonfly Pin with Adventurine, Peridot and Freshwater Pearl ||	  can't wait to give this as a gift  a good friend of mine is very hard to buy for, this will be perfect for her and I can't wait until the day I can give it to her.....super quick service too <end>
 B00076TR6A  Sterling Silver Pink Imitation Pearl Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Pretty but not what I expected  These are pretty but I was very disappointed because I thought I was getting pink pearls with the Swarovski pink crystals. The pearl is not real and actually feels plastic. I own several pearl necklaces (including pink) and these will never be worn with them because you can definitely tell the difference by looking at them, without even touching them, no luster at all. Very disappointing. They should have been listed as 'faux' pearls. <end>  ANOTHER EVEN PRETTIER IN PERSON!  I have purchased many differnt kinds of jewelry from Amazon.com & so far I have never been let down....especially my last two purchases!Very Good Job on the presentation & the actual item!Paula from New York! <end>
 B00076VRTA  Sterling Silver Clear AB Round Crystal Bracelet 7.5 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  WOW  This is absolutely beautiful and the bracelet is everything and more than what was described. The crystals are of great quality and wearing it in full sunlight or a highly-lit room will show off this piece. Would order from this company again. <end>  stunning  i bought this bracelet to go with the necklace i purchased from swarovski. it is absolutely beautiful. the shipping was fast and it arrived early. i keep it in a velvet box with my other swarovski crystal jewelry and you cannot tell the difference, the crystals are identical. i love how it picks up the light, any light. i've had many comments on it. i'm thinking about buying another one to double the glitz. will definitely be buying more jewerly from them. <end>  an ok product  It is very shiny, but it looks fake because it has a strange coating on it to make it shiny. Swarovski crystal doesn't coat their products like that. Theirs catches lights naturally not like this one which depends on the coating. I have real swarovsski jewelry. When I wear them together, you can see great difference. <end>  Beautiful product  The bracelet is beautiful and definitely sparkles with color in the light. I expected it to be made with smaller beads and to be daintier, but it is lovely anyways! <end>  Beautiful Bracelet  The bracelet I ordered and received was beautiful. I am very pleased with the bracelet and the prompt delivery of the items I ordered. <end>  Beautiful  I bought the bracelet for my daughter who is in college. She loves and wears it everywhere. I was so impreseed with the product that I'm buying another for a wonderful friend birthday. <end>  Beautiful Swarovski crystal bracelet  Very nice bracelet, good quality and affordable. This one was a gift for my daughter. The bracelet just fit around the small of my wrist, and wish it was offered in an 8". It's easier to remove links, rather than add links. I like a bracelet to have a little bit of room around my wrist. The crystal sparkles and picks up the light and color, it's very nice.I really like the Swarovski crystal, hard to find in the department stores. <end>
 B00078K226  Pugster 22K Golden Plated Dragonfly Rose Pink Swarovski Crystal Diamond Accent Animal Brooches And Pins ||	  Beautiful-  I love this brooch~ a gift from my Guy~ brilliant colors and looks so lovely! What a beauty~ although, the pin adhere thingy fell off after three wears- hubby fixed it~ thanks be that I didn't lose the clasp on the floor~ <end>
 B00078MNZ0  Pugster 316l Surgical Steel Purple Crystal Triple Celtic Cross Dangle February Belly Navel Ring Body Jewelry ||	  beautiful  the picture does not do justice to the exactual cameo...it quite breath taking...I gave it as a christmas gift to my mother and when she wears the cameo complements are non stop. <end>
 B00078XOZS  5.66 TCW Princess-Cut Purple Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Cocktail Ring Sizes 7-12 ||	  a fun cocktail ring  This ring feels like an attractive high-end cocktail design, and is fun for that purpose. I wouldn't necessarily wear it in daytime. The center stone is HUGE and kind of defines it as a fun cocktail choice but not necessarily serious daily jewelery. But the stone setting is secure and the overall look is tasteful. I really like the corkscrew CZ front (it's brought together into one thick piece at the back). <end>
 B00078ZMQM  Swarovski Sapphire Double Gem Belly Button Ring ||	  Superb Color!!  Bought as a gift for my girlfriend last week. She loved the very bright color of the stone. She is a little short and this belly ring is a little on the long side so it does look big on her but she said she really liked it and the size didnt bother her. I received this in 3 days, I would definitely buy from Body Candy again with how fast they sent this ring. <end>  Great buy!  Same color blue as shown. A little long but still fits well. Only Complaint is that the silver seems a little more dull than the picture but otherwise I am very satisfied with the product. My item arrived quickly and the company was in touch. I'll definitely purchase from this seller again. <end>  Another good one  Personally, I like this kind better. It doesn't stick out and you don't feel a thing. I prefer sapphire because it's my birthstone.HOLLA BACK! <end>
 B00078ZMSK  Swarovski Aurora Double Gem Belly Button Ring ||	  Simple, Pretty, but Slightly Pink  I have had this navel ring for a few months now and it has held up well. It's a low-profile piece of jewelry that does not show underneath or catch clothing. Just be warned that the stone has a slight pinkish hue. <end>  pretty accesory...not flashy  I like this belly ring because it's simple and pretty. It doesn't catch on things which is nice. The crystals are shimmery without being flashy. Had a little reaction to it at first but used Bactine and Neosporin to help it heal. <end>  THIS WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT  THIS WAS BOUGHT FOR MY NEICE AND SHE LOVES IT!!! SHE AND I LOVE THE BLING-BLING!!!! <end>  Looks Nice  This looks very nice for the price. I would recommend getting this one on here then going to the store. <end>  1 week and already falling apart.  I really like the colors in this belly button ring, but the top jewel fell out within a few days of putting it in. I also had to get pliers to unscrew the two pieces. I really like it, but unfortunately, it fell apart. <end>  Great!  It was better than expected! The gem is really pretty, and the metal did not irritate my piercing! Definitely a good purchase. <end>
 B000791GJI  Pink Jade Silver Heart Earrings ||	  excellent gift  Purchased these for last year's valentine's day. Great price for its materials. Good packaging and on time. Excellent choice for a year-long or decade-long relationship when you want your companion to feel appreciated. My lady adores them. Almost a year now and no problems. Almost 11 total. Earrings are in good shape as well. <end>  Very pretty  After I ordered it, I noticed that the description said it was 35 millimeters in length and thought I had bought a monstrosity! But it is probably 12 millimeters and is very pretty pink jade. <end>
 B0007CMVE4  Sterling Silver Turtle Band 4mm Ring Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  Cute and Comfortable  This ring is cute and comfortable to wear, also sturdy, it makes me happy just to look at makes me smile. I am 61 and need cute casual things for fun, but this would look good in any occassion. <end>  Charming Ring  When I received my turtle ring, I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was even better than described and I have had tons of compliments on this ring. The shipping and packaging was bar none better than most jewelry companies I have purchased from. You won't be sorry if you decide to order this ring from Gem Avenue. <end>  YES Score finially one in my size!  I love turtles and I love that this one came in my size. I saw one simular to it in a local store but it was only in a 6 and 8 and I needed a 10. I did buy one here but never wore it casue I don't want to lose it off my pinkie. I love this ring, I get comments on it all the time. <end>  question  this is not a review, i just want to know where can i find one of this but size seven. if you know please let me know <end>  Turtle Lover's Dream  I purchased this for my eleven-year-old, turtle obsessed daughter as a Christmas gift. The item was shipped quickly and packaged beautifully. The quality is better than I thought it would be. The details and proportions are perfect. She is going to absolutely LOVE this! Thank you! <end>  Joy!  Love this ring, I wear it all the time. This was my first time ordering a ring online and must say it was a great first time! If you like turtles, this is the ring for you. <end>  Perfect casual ring  I bought this ring probably a year ago, and it's definitely one of my everyday rings. It looks just like the picture, very true to size. Very cute and adorable, and unlike a lot of rings, it's flat enough that it doesn't get in my way. I think my only complaint is that I wish the feet were a little more detailed. <end>  Great Product  I really like turtles and this ring is really cute. I have 2 different turtle rings and I change them out. <end>  great ring!  Was delighted to see the ring upon arrival. The turtle is really cute. The ring is true to size and makes a great gift. WONDERFUL value!! <end>

 B0007CO8OU  Pretty! Black Hills Gold diamond-cut Rose Bud Women's Ring ||	  Very Dainty...  Super pretty ring. Very well made. Looks very dainty on the hand. Black Hills Gold is classic & always looks good w/ anything. <end>  Finally  I was given this exact ring as a teenager by friend's of my mothers', and pawned it for $20-to my everlasting shame. Having looked for a replacement to no avail, for so long that I almost given up...amazing that seven years later I just stumble upon it here on Amazon. Thanks. <end>
 B0007CZK6K  Duragold 14k Gold 5mm Ball Studs ||	  Nice, Basic Gold... Low Quality Overall  I bought these for one simple reason  they were basic gold earrings that I could wear every day. Nothing fancy, nothing too big. While the earrings themselves are nicely colored and have an even shape, the post and backing leave a lot to be desired. They do not "catch" - the connection is loose and unreliable. The post and backing have come apart often. I do not wear them to bed (although I have many earrings where that isn't a problem) and I do not pull on them or put them under any stress. They just aren't made very well. My solution, if you experience this and if returning them is not an option for you, is to go out and buy a package of gold backing from a jewelry or accessories store. Those seem to work out OK. <end>  nice everyday earrings  I'm petite, so I found these earrings the perfect size for everyday wear. 5mm is approx 1/5 inch. The velvet box and outer cardboard box are really nice for gift giving. <end>  Simply nice  These are basic, simple earrings of exceptional quality given the price. You would likely pay far more for comparable items elsewhere. <end>  Size matters  Although these are sized as for adults they are really better sized for young girls or teens. It's hard to picture the size from the discription so that's the best advice I can offer. For adults or larger people I would say go with a 7 or more. <end>  Simple and nice  I was pleased with these simple earrings. The ball isn't too small (1/2 cm). They worked well as a gift. <end>  Studs are too short!  I bought these earrings for my wife but it turns out that the studs are way too short. My wife has average-sized earlobes and has never had a problem like this before. <end>  Hidden Allergy  They're definitely cute, but be aware that if you're allergic to sterling silver, you're allergic to these. The posts that actually pierce your ears, and the piece that actually sits on the front of your ears, are either sterling or some other metal NOT white gold. I'm still waiting for my ears to heal. <end>  Poor quality earrings  I bought these earrings for my top part of my ear piercing-- they lasted about 3 days. When I first got them, they seemed nice but I immediately had problems with the post-- they were too small and needed to be bent in order for them to not fall out.The worst part was that the actual earring length. It is way too short! I managed to catch it the first time they fell apart but that didn't happen the second time-- i spent [...] bucks to have them for 3 days before one of them went completely missing because the post wouldn't stay in because the earring itself is way too short. Save yourself the time and money and go to Piercing Pagoda or another place like that to buy these studs and spend a few more bucks. I bought my first ones exactly like this from their and they lasted about 3 years. Much better quality. <end>  A real bargain  Amazon ran these earrings on the Friday sale last week, and I treated myself. They are a real bargain at $12, including free shipping if you spend $25 in qualified products. More importantly, they are of good quality, and I like the size. If they go on sale again, they are perfect stocking stuffers for young granddaughters. <end>  Very Cute!  And such a good size too! I ordered and received the 7mm earrings a few weeks earlier and they were a bit too big for my needs but these little ones are just perfect. <end>  Elegant earrings  Simple and elegant earrings. My wife loves them. However, the backs are a trifle small to work with.BAH <end>  Happy with purchase!  I chose this product for the size and price and I am happy with the earrings.The earrings are as described,they come in a little black pouch and would make a cute gift! <end>  So nice  Love the shine,and the price. The 5mm ball is not too small or too large. I prefer the simple style and the color is really a golden rose color. <end>  Small, practical, good  I like these. I wanted something that wasn't too flashy to wear on a regular basis, and I'm allergic to most of the earrings I currently have. I can wear these all day comfortably. They're subtle but not tiny; any bigger and I'd feel a little uncomfortable with them. The back is a little flimsy, and I do worry about losing them. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase. <end>  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Ball Studs  The quality of the earrings was nice. I had to return them because the posts were too short for my ear lobes. <end>  Nice Product  Love these earrings, they are the perfect size and I am very pleased with the product quality. All around a great product. <end>  FORGET IT  I was very disappointed in these. They look nice, but the tag (which was attached to the backing) was hard to remove and the backing bent very easy. Not worth the money, I'm returning mine <end>  Duragold 14k Gold 5mm Ball Stud Earrings - Beautiful!  Sometimes you just never know what you're going to get when you order online, but I was very pleased with this purchase! These earrings are high quality, and gorgeous. I gave them to my daughter as a Christmas gift, she loved loved loved them! Definitely, a good buy and the price is very reasonable. <end>  Not what I expected  When these earrings came in, they were smaller than I expected. The backing was bent, so the earring was not secure on the ear. I thought about returning them but the recepient said she would work with them......not happy with the purchase. <end>  Bad backs  Lousy the backs do not fit other than that they will be fine when I find the correct backs which might be hard to find. <end>  My Gold Ball Earrings  These earrings were a wonderful surprise. I didn't think that the finish would be as high gloss as it is. They fit nice and snug. I just ordered them to use an Amazon gift card that I had earned on a reward site. If I had only knew that Amazon.com sold jewelry this reasonable and this inexpensive I would have been ordering some little earrings from them. The only negative thing is that they are so light; but that is to be expected in the small gold content and the price. All in all a pretty good deal. <end>  makes a nice gift.  makes a nice gift to a young girl or young woman. This pair of earrings were made by the same company that sells EternaGold on QVC. <end>  Very Nice  Very nice product of good quality made my wife very happy. Much overkill on packaging. Picture two pairs of these (one a different size) in a box roughly 12x8x4 inches. Good service. <end>  Doubt if it's really 14k gold  I have been wearing the pair as basic studs for 2 months (not continuously). The color on the back of one of the studs already turned from gold to brown. Normally 14K gold shouldn't do that. 10K gold would change color easily. Also I'm allergic to certain metal so have to wear only gold or silver. I'm not allergic to other 14k gold studs/earrings I have but with this one that had the color change, my ear feels pain/itchy like when I wear those cheap metal studs. <end>  LOVE IT!!!!!!!  I bought these for my daughter for her Navy Graduation present and she absolutely LOVES THEM!! The Navy has certain specs. that you have to follow under the uniform code and these were perfect. This is actually my 2nd pair. She called me really upset saying she lost one and I told her I would order her more. These are cheap on price14k White Gold 5mm Ball Stud Earringsbut high in quality!!!! <end>  Loved them, but too big for me  Perfect simple earrings, but I like the 4mm size better--Amazon was out of them. I returned and hopefully the other size will be in stock soon. Nice quality. <end>  Disappointing  i guess I didn't realize how small 5mm is. These are a good size for agirl, but a little small for a woman. I don't wear particularly largeearrings, but these are very small. <end>  Good value, good price.  This is a gift that has yet to be given. I am confident that she will love them, though. <end>  Great Earrings! Shiny, Dainty, and Elegant!  I purchased these not deciding if I were going to keep them or give them as a gift. I ended up keeping them because they go perfect with my earring collection and will come in handy when I need something simple and pretty. Very happy with the purchase. They look great with white gold, platinum, or silver jewelry. Next time I'll get more as a gift. <end>  very nice for the price  they are nice however little smaller than I thought but that's my fault for not bringing out my metric rule... Very much recommend <end>  Good quality,Good price !!!  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the gold balls. I plan on buying another set (different size)next week. Earrings arrived in less than a week. <end>  Perfect everyday no reason gift  These lovely little gems are perfect for those women who, like me, have a second or third ear piercing. Small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious.These would make a great gift for a little girl as well.I particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as I suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear. Having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection. At the price of under 10 dollars I was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there, how are you. <end>  Great Earrings!  I ordered 2 pair of these earrings on the Friday sale and just received them yesterday and I absolutely loved them! I actually ordered 2 pair of white and 2 pair of the gold. I gave a pair of each to my daughter who's 7 yrs old and she put the gold one on right away and hasn't taken them off yet. I put the white gold one on too and I have't taken them off either. My other girl who's 4 and doesn't have her ears pierced yet said that she want's to go get her ears pierced on her birthday so she can wear those earrings.These are the best earrings for the price. They're definitely great gifts for anyone who has their ears pierced. <end>  Nice Earrings for a good price  I bought these earrings for my daughter who had just pierced her ears. They came in a lovely velvet pouch so that I didn't have to wrap them up. They are of good quality and are easy for her to use. I would buy from this company again. <end>  Lovely Gold Ball earrings.  Outstanding is what I say about the quality and price. I had purchased a pair earlier, misplaced one, and purchased these. I found the misplaced one, before these arrived, and am now happy to have two pair! Earrings of this quality and price are hard to find on line or in the department stores. I wear them almost everyday! <end>  Perfect Size For Earring Jackets  These fit perfectly in earring jackets; nice for the times I prefer not to use gemstone studs. Although a little small (which is why they work for the jackets) they are nice to wear alone, also. <end>  gold ball earring 5mm  These are very small at 5mm but the big problem is the earring backs are really really small and too hard to hold on to. I won't be wearing them much as they are hard to fasten. <end>  needed to replace a pair...  I needed to replace a pair of sterling silver earrings & opted for these 14k white gold ones. They're what I expected & would rate them higher, except for the teensy weensy eensy weensy backings. Seriously, visually impaired and/or arthritic baby boomers will have a problem using these. Hopefully I can find replacement ones 'cause I'll lose sight (pun intended) of these wee little backings sooner or later. I like the earrings just fine, they're what I expected. It's just those teensy weensy eensy weensy backings. Magnifying glass not included. <end>  Backs  These earrings DID NOT have the friction backs. Ordered in March and lost one within a few weeks. Found it and lost it again. Did not fit tight and only had 1 little lip to catch the back with at the very end. <end>  Perfect  These are excellent little earrings. I needed gold to put in my ears after a few years of not wearing any earrings. These fit the bill just right. They are well-made, and I recommend the size, as it is not so apt to get dented. I could wish, however, that the backs were just a little larger. All in all, a good everyday post for someone who's on the phone a lot. (They don't poke you behind your ear!) <end>  how to measure  This purchase was very disappointing. Yes, the gold ball is pretty, but it measures less than 4 mm! I did not want to spend the money returning them, so I wear them once and a while, but I am not happy about them at all. So much for trusting information on the internet. Next time I'll buy them in a store, so I can see what size they really are. <end>  Good Earrings - Bigger than expected  These earrings are good quality. I'm allergic to most earrings, but I've worn these non-stop since I got them with no problems at all(about 3 days now). One thing that surprised me was the size. I ordered them to wear in my 2nd ear piercing just above the main hole, but they were way too big for that. My husband said they looked like Christmas ornaments, ha. So they are now in the lower piercing, and I will have to find smaller ones for the 2nd piercing. I will try to upload a photo to show the size of earring/ear ratio. <end>  Dainty  These earrings are very classy, and the perfect size. But be aware that the backs are tiny, and easy to lose. I've learned not to put these on when I'm in a hurry, after spending ten minutes hunting for a dropped back! <end>  Comfy  I never take them out...much! They are the perfect size for me. Not too big so as to overwhelm my tiny ears, and not too small to be unnoticeable. They can be worn with practically anything. Very understated and yet elegant at the same time. <end>  14K 5mm gold ball earrings  I purchased these gold earrings to go with the pair of 4mm gold ball earrings I bought from Amazon. I have multiple pierces in my ears and these go well with the others. They are great quality at a very good price. Much cheaper than local jewelery stores. <end>  Simple and Elegant  I purchased these earrings as a treat for myself. I wanted something classic and small that could be worn for casual or dressy events.I absolutely love these. They are lightweight, they shine, and I have received many compliments on them.These earrings do not irritate my ears at all. In fact, they are the most comfortable pair I own. I can never fall asleep with my earrings in; the holes get dry and itchy if I do. These, however, have been in since I received them almost a month ago. There is absolutely no irritation.They go well with a shirt and jeans, or a dress, or business casual. You could wear them with pearls, a chain, funky jewelry, or dressy diamonds. They are a classic staple for anyone's jewelry collection. I highly recommend these. <end>  Great Earrings!  I ordered 2 pair of these earrings on the Friday sale and just received them yesterday and I absolutely loved them! I actually ordered 2 pair of white and 2 pair of the gold. I gave a pair of each to my daughter who's 7 yrs old and she put the gold one on right away and hasn't taken them off yet. I put the white gold one on too and I have't taken them off either. My other girl who's 4 and doesn't have her ears pierced yet said that she want's to go get her ears pierced on her birthday so she can wear those earrings.These are the best earrings for the price. They're definitely great gifts for anyone who has their ears pierced. <end>  cheap stems  It turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife's ears. I assume that the stems must not be white gold? Other than that they are as expected. Not perfect, but not bad for the price. <end>  How Does Amazon Do It?  I bought two pair of these earrings in April 2005 for $10 each, one for me and one for a granddaughter. Now Amazon is running them for $9 on the Friday sale. It's not too soon to be thinking about Christmas stocking stuffers. These would be perfect. These are real gold, quality earrings. I love mine and have worn them now for almost two years with no problems, having to be careful about metal allergies. What are you waiting for? <end>  Poor Quality Earring Backs  The earrings are unwearable because the backs slip right off. There is no friction. <end>  Not the Same...  I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm sizes in the past. I was happy with all, but not with this new pair of 5mm size. These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner. While they look good, the posts are very slippery and the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily. I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost). Otherwise, they would have been fine. I returned them and would not buy this pair again. <end>  What a bargin!  I bought these, along with the 14K 7mm gold earrings, for my wife and she liked them both very much. 5mm is petite and they really look nice on her. I got them on sale for $9.00, what a bargin for 14K white gold. <end>  great value for simple earrings  These are really lovely, simple everyday earrings. My ears have recently developed a sensitivity to metals other than gold and I purchased these to have a pair of small, everyday studs. My only complaint is that the backings are very small and not very tight. I lost one pretty quickly but replaced it at my local jeweler. <end>  An incredible bargain  I got these for $9 on the Friday Sale. They are well made and the perfect size. You absolutely will not find a better pair for the price. Wait for the Friday Sale if you can. <end>  Perfect!!  I was looking for gold ball earrings for multiple pierced ears, and I found these! They are the perfect shade of gold, slightly on the light side, not that vivid orange-y color that you see on a lot of gold-plated things. They matched my other 14k pieces perfectly. The quality is excellent for the price! A lot of customers have commented about the backs being small or delicate. Yes, they are small, but they fit tightly and are very secure. I have lots of 14k gold studs, and most of them have the same small backs, so these are nothing unusual. Overall, super glad I bought them! Couldn't be happier!! You can't go wrong buying from Amazon. <end>  What a wonderful gift!  These gold earrings come in a lovely box adn will make an excellent stocking stuffer for my daughter! I wish I had ordered another pair for myself! <end>  Earrings  Best of both worlds. They don't make me break out like the sterling silver or cheaper sets and they are the perfect size to wear all the time if I want. Love them! I only purchased them because they were on sale but they turned out to be my best product. <end>  Should've listened to other reviewers before buying.  The earrings are pretty, but as other reviewers have noted the backs are very, very small, and they do slip right off of the post. The post are quite a bit shorter than average also. Mine were also packaged poorly  one of the earrings were inside of the lining of the velvet pouch making me at first thinking one was missing. There was also some kind of a sticker inside the pouch which had one of the backs looped into it. It was very difficult to remove. It didn't matter anyway because the backs were worthless and fell off the post right on the first wear. I bought these earrings thinking I would just leave them in for everyday wear and be able to sleep in them, but the way they are made, I don't feel comfortable doing this as I know they will fall out and get lost. Earrings are pretty however and so far aren't bothering my sensitive ears so will be keeping them, and using one of my old backs from another pair. This was somewhat of a disapointing purchase for me. <end>  Great fit...  Not too big and not too small... doesnt squeeze ears not even in sleep fits great. Will order more soon! <end>  Just the right size  I'm giving these as a gift for my young niece. They are just the right size for her small ears! <end>  Beautiful!  These earrings look so rich and pretty! The little bag they come in was pretty but disconcerting because at first I only saw one earring. Can't wait to give them to my daughter for Christmas. <end>  Lost an earring the first day I wore them.  The backs of these earrings do not securely fit onto the earring posts. The notches on the post that are used to secure the backs to the posts are almost non- existent. Generally, the Duragold brand of jewelry is good quality jewelry, but this particular item is worthless (functionally, at least). I did not expect an earring to fall out and go missing the first day I wore them. They are completely useless now. I do not recommend purchasing them. <end>  Disappointed  Just received the earrings (white gold). Major design errors. Never seen earring with such short post. If the post is short, the backing has to be bigger as compensating factor to keep the earring sitting properly and preventing it from slipping off the little backing. But the backings are extra small, not just small. It will just be matter of days that the earrings slip off the ears. I should have taken heed of comments made by other purchasers in such respects. The only way to wear this pair of earrings is as suggested by other purchasers  to use other backings which are appropriately sized to hold them.Also, the ball is said to be 5mm, but compared to my other 5mm ball studs, this one looks more like 4mm. That moving display picture is deceiving  not in proportion with the actual product.Otherwise, the earrings are fine. Solid, good shine. <end>  Adult Lobes - small earrings  I think these were made for children.... I gave these as a gift to my daughter - and they were to small for her lobes! I think they were mismarked in Amazon... She in turn gave them to a friends daughter...watch the labeling. <end>  Lovely earrings!  The earrings arrived a day before scheduled. I love them. My clumsy fingers had no trouble with the clasps even on the tricky upper ear holes with earrings already below.Many thans! <end>  These were adorable~  They are really classy. My mother bought them a year ago for her friends daughters.Sadly, one of the girls lost her earrings right away, so I suggest getting these for an older, more responsible child or an adult. <end>  Watch out for the tape...  Earrings arrived in good time BUT - watch out for the heavy duty and sticky tiny tape that they run through the opening of 1 of the earring backs. Finally got it off but the back got bent in the process. They're so tiny but tried to fix it. I thought I had and an hour later realized that the back had come off while wearing it. Lost forever. Had to use a spare that I already had. Other than that, these are your basic ball stud earrings. WHY did you have to put that tape there? <end>  Gold Ball Stud Earrings  Exactly what I wanted! My ears are double pierced and I like to wear something small above my regular earrings. <end>  Cute, but still chose to return them  I have a small/medium sized lobe and have to say that they're really cute on but I was really paranoid about them falling out. The backing is really short and the clasps are flimsy and TINY. I have never seen a clasp this small before; it looked almost as if they were meant for baby earrings. Because the clasp was so thin and small, they would move out of place and slide while wearing them. I wanted these for casual wear, but couldn't justify having to worry about them staying in all the time. Also, they didn't feel or look substantial, very, very light in weight and color. <end>  Nice earrings - cheap backs  I really like the studs, but the backs might as well be made out of tin foil. From the start they did not secure the earring and bent terribly out of shape when I tried to squeeze them to fit tighter on the post. I ended up tossing the worthless backs and using ones from another pair of earrings I own. <end>  Love these  These earrings are great. 5mm is noticeably sized. I needed 14k gold because I wear them 24/7. Very comfortable. <end>  lost one of them  Nice size, cheap price but poor quality. I have lost one of them from my left ear. I have no idea where it is now. I could buy another set but why bother? <end>  Very nice! -- At First  I purchased these in yellow gold a few weeks ago and could not be more pleased. They seem to be made quite well and have a nice luster to them. I had no trouble inserting them and little difficulty putting the back on. Even my big man's fingers were able to put the back on the post. Maybe it was beginner's luck because I have struggled with other stud earrings with equally small backs.I like the 5mm size. It seems to be just the right size for a man. Attractive without being ostentatious. I only have one earlobe pierced so buying earrings in pairs means I always have a spare. Right now I expect to get many years of pleasure from these earrings. If my opinion should change I will try to remember to update this review.ETA  I almost forgot to tell you. These earrings actually come with a "Made in America" tag. That made me very happy I ordered them.UPDATE after 2 months  Well, they were nice while they lasted. It's a good thing I have that spare earring. I've had to change this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. The ear nuts that came with them are apparently a little loose. I lost one earring after wearing it for about a week so I've purchased replacement ear nuts. Hopefully they will work better than the originals.To be honest, I wear an earring 24/7 including when sleeping or showering. I've been doing that for several years and this is the first time I've completely lost an earring. I've had some come loose but they loosened gradually enough that I always felt it before the ear nut came off completely. The reviewed earring must have come loose and fallen out quickly enough that I didn't feel anything.FURTHER UPDATE  I found the earring that had fallen out and tried a spare ear nut on it. I had purchased several different sizes here on Amazon and found an ear nut that fit snugly enough I don't think I have to worry about it coming off. This earring is now back on the ones-I-like-to-wear list. I intend to go through all of my stud earrings and replace any ear nuts I suspect will not hold well. <end>  Not made for adult earlobes  It certainly would have been helpful if the length of theearring post was part of the item description.The posts were WAY too short to be comfortable and secureon adult earlobes.Fortunately, I was able to return them for a full refund. <end>  cute..backs don't stay!  Cute..stay shiney but the backs are too loose and fall off the posts. I had to use other backs from a different pair of earrings to keep the earrings fron falling out if my ears! I was dusappointed. <end>  Posts too short, lost one in matter of days  These were the size I wanted and they were cute but the posts were very short. It almost seems that these were children's jewelry. Nor did the catches stay in place. I lost an earring within three days. As far as I an concerned, these are not worth purchasing due to the design of the earrings. <end>  Very small and difficult to put on  Nice earrings if a bit larger and longer tip so that it goes through ear with room to spare so that it is easier to put on and so that the clip does not have to pushed into ear so that they stay. I had to take them off because it hurt. <end>  Very cute  I wanted earrings that I could leave in 24/7. These earrings are perfect. I can sleep with them and have no issues. They are just the right size and comfortable. <end>  Lovely studs, but replace the backings  These are lovely white gold studs. I needed something simple to wear in second holes and after going through an annoying series of sterling silver options, I bought these. They match all my white metal jewelry.The surface is not a perfect mirror finish - there are imperfections - but then I can't imagine anyone but myself examining them that closely. My one complaint with these studs is the backings. They are A) tiny B) lose and C) flimsy. If you wish to keep the studs for longer than a day, I would replace the backings immediately with plastic, or even a tighter silver backing. I snatched the backings off of one of my sterling silver studs that I had abandoned, and they immediately provided a sturdier and more secure fit for them. The shaft length was perfect for me as well. Any longer and I would feel them while holding a phone to my ear. <end>  goldstuds  I really liked the earrings but they were a bit smaller than I expected. It's very hard to judge the size of things such as jewelry,mhandbags, etc, if you don't see them on a model. But the product was quality and the service from Amazon was excellent. <end>  Good for Everyday Wear  I was going to get the 7 or 8mm size, until I read reviews. I'm so glad I got these. I have tiny ears and they are perfect for everyday wear. The backs are very delicate and my right earring flew off as I was getting a haircut today, but other than that, they are easy, simple and I don't even notice they're there. <end>  love them + no reaction to ears = happy ears!  )  i love these earrings. exactly what the description is. i have been wearing them for a week and this is the FIRST pair of earrings that i have been able to wear without a reaction! sweet deal! <end>  nice earrings  comfortable to wear. look great on. pleasantly surprised. also, a little larger than i expected. <end>  great value!  i lost one of my earrings from having my ears pierced and needed to replace it with 14 kt gold. this was perfect. <end>  5 mm gold ball earrings are nice for petite ears.  These earrings are very darling - shiny and a nice hue of gold. The quality looks fine and the backs on mine do click, but the backs are pretty small too, so have to be careful handling them. I think these earrings would look best on a petite person or young teen. They might appear a bit small on someone with med to large sized ears. <end>  Gold Ball Earrings  Great earrings,bought a set for my girlfriend.She loves them! Style glow and style they have are second to none! People compliment her all the time. <end>  Soooo tiny  I have bought those earrings for my girfriend and it was a surprise.I was so astonish to found out they were so tiny and beautiful. <end>  gold ball earrings  Perfect for daily wear, size is great, big enough to decorate, without being over powering. <end>
 B0007D2L2A  Musical Movements - Plays "Pachelbel's Canon" (Set of 2) ||	  Charming  Both little music boxes play beautifully, enchanting sound. Unusual musical choices with these items that set them apart, in addition to price, quality and value. I'm going to keep several to give as little gifts and thank you gestures during the year. <end>
 B0007D69R8  Sterling Silver Crystal 1mm Omega Chain Necklace Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  It is not like a snowflake  Imagine a cube being built with 12 crystals. 4 for the base, 4 for the roof, and 4 linking the top and the bottom. That is what this product is. I had thought this was sort of like a hexagonal snowflake almost melted together into a solid structure of various colors. It is not.Is it beautiful? Yes. It's gorgeous... but I have to say I'm a bit more fond of the anklet and bracelet done in this style if you are picking and choosing. The anklet especially I think would be impossible to go wrong with. <end>  BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE!  this necklace surely deserves a 5 star rating! i am more than satisfied with this product, it sparkles so bright and it is definitely an eye catcher  ) the colors are beautiful and the chain is a very nice sturdy chain, not cheap!!! outstanding for the price, LOVE IT! <end>  Love it!  Highly recommend it. I love it. Received it quickly. The colors and brightness are just great. I love it, period. <end>  Bought as a gift  I purchased this as a gift for my cousin. She loves it! When I received the necklace it was just slightly different from what I had thought it would be but I am pleased regardless. The crystal cluster was slightly bigger than I thought it would be, it's about the size of a large 'shooter' marble. It is very light and looks beautiful when the light hits it. What is really nice is that you can put the cluster on the chain any way you like so depending on what you are wearing you can adjust which crystals show the most prominently. I would buy another one. <end>  Cute!  My children bought this for me as a Mother's Day present. It's not quite what I expected as the pieces shift when you touch it...I had expected something more solid. I have received tons of compliments when I wear it. The chain is sturdy and a great compliment to the crystal. Recommend. <end>  Very nice necklace-you will get comments on it!  I had already ordered the matching bracelets for gifts and they were so stunning I ordered this necklace for myself. It's a beautiful and memorable piece of jewelry. <end>  Gorgeous Crystal  I bought the necklace as a gift. It is a really gorgeous crystal. It is sparkle and very big too. I like it a lot. <end>  Nice and cute!  This is a really cool necklace! Depending on your neck size, you might want to get one 16" or longer because the 14" was a bit tight. It's rather nice and neat! <end>  Very nice gift, but wanted to keep for myself  The chain was very nice, arrived on time and in good shape. It was bought for a gift, I wanted to keep it for myself, but would have ordered earrings and bracelet. Looks more pastel colored than the picture. Nice necklace. <end>  SwarovskiChainReview  Excellent quality. Expedient shipping. I bought it for my sister and she has liked it a lot. <end>
 B0007G6M86  Brocade Jewelry Bag ||	  Perfect for traveling  Very nice travel size. Recipient loves it and says she'll use it for everyday as well. Roomy and will hold a lot of jewelry. Good quality, pretty fabric. <end>  Great  A friend of mine had one of these, but this one is bigger and hold more. It makes traveling with jewelry great. <end>  Lindo  Me encant&oacute; este organizador de joyitas, lo compre para mi hija, es super &uacute;til sobre todo para las personas que viajan mucho. <end>
 B0007IFWY4  Solid 14kt Yellow Gold 2mm Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Nose Ring ||	  cute  Looks nice, small gauge. Was a bit more difficult to insert than my original, due to tighter loop. I like the fact that the post is shorter, so less of it "shows" inside your nose. It has a snugger fit, stays in well. <end>  not good  I have had my nose pierced for years and I am pretty used to purchasing nose pins/rings like this but I have never been so dissapointed. Had I known that the quality of this piece of jewelry was going to be so low I would've saved my $10.99+expedited shipping, spend a little more and got a real nose pin. The last nose pin I had got old and was due for a replacement, I found this one and bought it but as soon as I got it I thought this must be a joke because it was by far the smallest nose ring I've seen (it wouldn't fit my sister who has a small nose).I have never been dissapointed by bodycandy before so don't let this review reflect your opinion of their company or service. I always receive my orders quickly and I have never been dissapointed with their jewelry before but this piece was laughable. <end>  Best nose ring  I bought this , knowing that the hook would be tight, so after several attempts I decide it to bend it with a pair of tweezers. It worked perfect. It's been in my nose ever since. The loop is tight but workable. Ilove it because of the size is perfect. If your looking for something small this is the one. <end>  Bad  Nose earring was too small to put in my nose, and as i was trying to put it in, the little rhinestone came out of the earring. I need to return. <end>  left/right nostril (wrong nostril)  I wish I had checked the shape of my old nose screw because this one didn't fit me.  ( Supposedly this jewelry corresponds to a left nostril piercing, but that is certainly not my experience. All the "left nostril" nose screws shown by Body Candy look like this item, but my own personal nose screw - that actually fits in my left nostril - looks like the ones they advertise as "right nostril" nose screws. I am perplexed!Aside from that, it is good quality but DOES look much smaller than its stated gauge. I got a s.steel nosering from the same company and it doesn't look as small, so maybe it's because it's gold. Not sure which nose screw to choose now... <end>

 B0007LWIDO  Tiny Heart Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver, #2515 ||	  Delightful Heart  I bought this small heart to wear on my upper ear while I wear a dangle earring on the bottom. It is the perfect small size and good quality & weight. This heart would also look good worn on the bottom of the ear lobe if you have only one piercing. It is good quality for the price and I highly recommend this earring. <end>
 B0007LWIES  Southwestern Chip Inlay Turquoise Cross Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver, #2519 ||	  Excellent  Great product! Excellent Company to do business with! Great value looks like they should cost 4 or 5 times as much! <end>  Beautiful!  I purchased this item for a women's support/prayer group of which I am a member. They were "oohed" and "aahed" over by all involved. They are truly beautiful and of high quality. Would definitely order again. <end>

 B0007MXZ3U  Large Triangular Genuine Turquoise Fan Earrings in Sterling Silver ||	  Loved Them!  I bought these for my Sister-in-law for her birthday and had them shipped directly to her. She called me as soon as she received them, to let me know how much she loved them. I was hoping that they'd be nice, as I had only the picture to go by, and was thrilled to hear how happy that she was with them. I would definately suggest them to anyone. <end>
 B0007NDZT8  Dolphin Bead Dangle Translucent Belly Ring ||	  Cheaply made jewlery  The dolphin bead dangle belly ring looks really cute. But only after a week that I'd been wearing it, the dangle part broke off. Bottom line is it looks great on-line, but when you receive the item, you can tell it's very cheaply made. <end>  Love it!  This was very cute and I wore this one the most out of all my other gems. It goes with almost everything. <end>
 B0007NKZIW  Pugster Mood Square Italian Charm Bracelet ||	  Fun & Pretty  Pugster was very helpful in getting this mood charm to me ... get one for yourself ... you'll enjoy it! <end>  Mood Stuff  I wouldn't go and buy a mood ring, but they're great if you get your hands on them. They're fun to put on all your friends and see what everyone's feeling....then laugh if their mood is black, which means angary or stressed. If you get blue for passionate feeling "in love" you get to press them for who they like or whatever. Pretty cool. <end>
 B0007NL914  Pugster Name Jocelyn Laser Charms Italian ||	  Love this Charm!  I wanted to create a family italian charm bracelet with my daughters first and middle names.

 B0007NMJ36  Sterling Silver Clear Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  lots of compliments  Not too big to be flashy but large enough to be tastefully noticeably. I've gotten lots of compliments for them. They have a wonderful prismatic effect, catching light and throwing it back in a variety of ever changing colors. And they are different, not something you see everyday. If you like crystals, these are for you. Also appreciated the fact that they came in a nice gift box and very promptly. A good product and a very nice deal at the sale price. <end>  Fabulous earrings!  These earrings exceeded my expectations. I love them. Perfect size and length. Was worried they might look cheap. Believe me they do not! Great buy for the money. <end>  Very pretty, eye-catching color and sparkle  These earrings are very pretty. I love the way that capture the light and shine. The colors are beatiful and I receive many compliments when I wear them. I love leverback earrings; they are comfortable to wear and seem secure. These earrings are the perfect size and length. Definitely recommend. <end>  Very pretty earrings  I like these earrings very much. They are just the right size. I was afraid they would be too long for me, but they are not. The crystal has a very pretty way of changing colors when they are moving. You should be able to wear them with several different colors. I'm a big fan of leverback earring and these are of good quality. <end>  nice earrrings  These are cute little earrings, go with everything, sparkle beautifully. The picture is not very accurate, since they are not as colorful as shown. <end>  earrings  I'd had these on my wish list for almost a year. I love them. I wish I'd ordered them sooner. The only problem was IMHO, the shipping was a bit much for them to be packaged in an envelope. But they arrived safe and sound. Have gotten several compliments on them. Would buy again. <end>  crystal lever back earrings  These earrings are so beautiful! They catch the light and reflect so many different colors. I plan on ordering more! <end>

 B0007NOFL0  Pugster Name Logan Laser Charms Italian Bracelet ||	  Cheap  This brand is rather cheap, however it isn't expensive so I shouldn't be surprised. The thing is taking the links apart, I dented them just taking them apart, so be careful! The laser engraving looks great, I do have to say. <end>

 B0007OEZ96  4 Leaf Clover - Belly Ring - Luck of the Irish - Quality Materials - Customize Your Fit ||	  Fantastic! Saved my piercing!  After having a baby and losing around 45 pounds, my navel piercing doesn't look like it used to. Every ring I've gotten doesn't fit right like its too loose, or if it was a top dangle would get caught on stuff and irritate it. I was considering just taking it out and letting it close up. Not this one! The dangle doesn't feel heavy so it doesn't pull down, but it is good quality and not flimsy. The bar fit my piercing perfectly so it doesn't look like its just hanging there. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who is having problems with the bar being too long and wants something different from just a plain standard barbell! Fast shipping and very well packaged. Couldn't have been better. <end>  Love this!  After the birth of my child, my belly button piercing was left EXTREMELY shallow. I thought that I was never going to be able to wear a belly button ring again. All of the ones I tried on were so long that they looked ridiculous. The 5/16" bar fits perfectly, and the jewelry design makes it look like it isn't even a shallow piercing. Best ring hands down for shallow piercings, it looks great! <end>  Clover jewelry  It came quickly, with more than adequate packaging and it was a big hit with my son's girlfriend. <end>
 B0007OEZ9G  Polishing cloth for jewelry ||	  More details  These measure about 5'' x 8'' and appear to be the same product as theSunshine Polishing Clothsold by Element Jewelry, and theTrio of Sunshine Cleaning Clothssold by Southwest Spirit (though the 'Trio' I received from them did not have the Sunshine trademark on the packaging). They produce excellent shine with little effort.When this gets fully covered with tarnish and stops working (I think that's going to be a lot of silverware from now), I'll try washing it, then using it to applySimichrome Polishto compare results. I'll report back here with data from that experiment, afterwards. <end>  Great cloth  This cloth is great, cleans exceptionally well. It cleans those small crevices in jewelry that has intricate detail work. It does a much better job than the liquid cleaners...doesn't smell either. Lastly, this cloth will still continue to clean well, when it becomes absolutely filthy, but don't wash it. If you choose to wash the cloth it will lose some of it's cleaning ability.One thing though, this seller charges too much. Purchase it from the seller, "Element Jewelry". The exact same cloth is over 2.00 cheaper, and is eligible for Super saver delivery, too. Also, Element packages the cloth in a handy, heavy duty, black card-like envelope. The envelope is perfect for storing the cloth, especially when it become dirty. (It does look just awful when it's dirty). I made a mistake when I purchased from this seller. I thought I was getting a pack of 2 and a good deal....oh well. <end>  My silver jewelry never looked better  This polishing cloth does a very nice job of cleaning silver jewelry. I didn't realize how dull my silver ring and bracelet had gotten until I used this cloth. The cloth is thick and should last a long time. I only wish more than one came in the package. <end>  not effective  There doesn't seem to be enough of the polishing element in the cloth. It takes a very long time of polishing to take any of the tarnish off. <end>  Works great.  I own high-end costume jewelry and these cloths polish the metals wonderfully. I will recommend this product and purchase it again. <end>  Easy Clean  Polishing cloth makes cleaning tarnished jewelry so easy! Easy to store and allows you to leave tarnish if polishing Indian Jewlery so you can control the look of your piece. <end>  Works good as it should.  Keeps my silver stuff looking new and shiny. A great investment and a great way to keep your silver investment looking spectacular. I usually polish my silver stuff as I'm watching TV. Before you know it .... everything is sparkling again. <end>  Jewelry polishing cloth  This product worked where the liquid alternatives failed! Very satisfied with this purchase - will purchase again when I need. <end>
 B0007OGSNM  Crystalline WINGED DRAGONFLY Belly Ring ||	  Did not receive what was pictured, but I like it anyway  I ordered the dragnofly belly ring that had a red stone for the head. The one I received has all white stones. It also is much bigger than I thought. But it is very beautiful, and good quality. It arrived very quickly. My last one was from Body Candy- the finish on it wore a bit after a couple of years of constant wear. But for the price, I didn't care. I was ready for a new one anyway. <end>
 B0007OK6V2  SCNK013OMG Sterling Silver Omega Chain Crystal Necklace Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  I got this one right!

But this pendant, along with several matching items, has been a big hit with her . . . and she gets a lot of compliments on it. <end>  I LOVE this piece!  Very impressed with this piece! Very sparkly, great quality, bigger than expected, which is great! Even the small necklace that came with the pendant is of great quality silver. VERY happy with this purchase! I get compliments every time I wear it! <end>  Beautiful crystal charm  This was a gift for my mother. She loved it. Great packaging from the seller and excellent service. <end>  very pretty  necklace is very nice, ordered earring that matched for a gift and it made a nice set, wasn't disapointed with it <end>  Beautiful Pendant at Excellent Price  Bought this pendant for my daughter for Christmas. Pendant was exactly as described seller. Excellent quality with a good price. If you are looking for a beautiful crystal pendant than this one is an excellent choice. Seller was speedy in delivery. I have no problem recommending this seller to others, as I most likely will buy from this seller again. <end>

 B0007OK72K  Sterling Silver Omega Chain with Clear Crystal Necklace Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  disappointment  This "genuine" crystal looks cheap and anyone could have gotten it out of a gumball machine.

Remind me not to buy anything from Gem Avenue again. <end>  disappointment  This "genuine" crystal looks cheap and anyone could have gotten it out of a gumball machine.

 B0007P6FBG  Rn Nurse Italian Charm ||	  Nurse  Very nice. The colors seemed to be a little darker than they appeared in the picture, but that didn't make me like it less. <end>
 B0007P9OQO  Carribean Sea Banana Belly Ring ||	  =)  Darker than the picture, but very nice - this belly ring reminds me of the ocean - the name fits it perfectly. <end>
 B0007PAT0Y  Solid Titanium Double Gem Cobalt Blue Barbell 5/16-3mm ||	  Perfect mini size  When I had my eyebrow pierced, they gave me a very large barbell. I am into smaller body jewelry and this was a perfect size. It is really tiny so the ball is tough to get on and off. The color hasn't faded, rusted, or chipped. It looks the same as when I purchased it. <end>
 B0007PAT3Q  Solid Titanium Double Gem Purple Barbell 3/8-3mm ||	  Great size!  This barbell is perfect size for me. They originally put a very large barbell in my eyebrow but, I wanted something smaller so I ordered from this website. I am very pleased with my purchase and the color hasn't changed or faded yet. <end>
 B0007PF95E  Medical Identification Jewelry-Bracelet- Diabetic ||	  Diabetic ID Bracelet  I like the bracelet. It is small , but a person can get all information on it. The price and shipping time were great!!!! I would recommend the bracelet for anyone who is a diabetic. It would be nice if information needed on the bracelet could be put on at the time of ordering instead of sending bracelet back in. I have a medical allergy bracelet also and it has all the information on it. So I didn't need to send bracelet back in. Once I have the bracelet on I can't even tell I'm wearing it. <end>
 B0007PO5UY  Picasso Jasper Natural Stone Bcr Captive Ring ||	  Cute  When I got it i was very happy. It did break the next day but that was my fault. It truly was what I had wanted and the product described was actually better in person than what the photo is able to show. <end>

 B0007QOLHK  Rhodium plated and enamel Scottish flag cufflinks with presentation box ||	  Beautiful cufflinks...  I recently ordered five pairs of cufflinks online, looking for some variety from what Nordstrom, my usual haunt, had in their stores. These Scottish flag links stood out. Actually, the pictures don't do them justice... they're very well-crafted, and really pop on the cuffs of a white dress shirt. Very happy with my purchase! <end>
 B0007QR93I  Cat Lover Silver Tone and Multicolor Cats Magnetic Bracelet ||	  the perfect gift  Its a lovely bracelet,very good design and nice material, so its the perfect gift,surely I will do a lot of shopping to this seller. <end>  magnetic bracelet  The bracelet was very attractive, well made, and was described fairly accurately. But I did feel a little misled. I was expecting a bracelet with magnets in the links, however only the clasp was magnetic. It was a nice item, just not what I had anticipated. It would have been better if it had been described as having a magnetic clasp, not as a magnetic bracelet. <end>  What a great bracelet!  I bought this bracelet for a friend and she loves it. I was very pleased with the weight and quality. <end>  Magnetic cats  I am very happy with my Cats bracelet. Love the style, the colours, and the magnetic clasp does up easily and sits flat so that it does not get caught on clothing. I was also very impressed by the fact that it was delivered to Australia within just a few days of ordering. A friend liked it so much that she has ordered one as well! <end>  Nice bracelet of cats well worth its price  The bracelet with cats in emanel is nice and worth its price. Can be recommended. <end>  Excellent value!  I received this bracelet as a Christmas gift and wear it most days. I bought one as a gift for a fellow cat lover. It is nicely made and appropriate for someone 8 or 80. Each cat has its own distinct personality. Service was excellent from Silver Insanity and I highly recommend them. <end>  Cat Silver Tone & Multicolor Magnetic Bracelet  I love the detail of this enameled bracelet, the only disadvantage is that it is heavy. The seller was very prompt in sending it. So very pleased with them. <end>  My wife loved it  I bought it as a gift.It seems very solid and well made. Quite heavy.My wife loved it. <end>  Haven't yet recieved it???  I am displeased with this seller, because I notified them of my change of address and they confirmed my change of address, and yet I haven't recieved my item 1 month after ordering it.I wouldn't reccommend this seller to anyone. <end>
 B0007RXDAK  14k White Gold 3.5mm Comfort Fit Engagement Ring Setting ||	  Most people don't pay much attention to the setting...  I purchased the ring in conjunction with a solitaire diamond. I always believed the diamond should speak for itself and the ring shoud be simple. This is the case with this ring. When I appraised the stone, the gemologist also verified the gold content of the ring. It proved to be 14k, just as advertised. I was a little apprehensive about purchasing jewelry online, but Amazon has a very easy satisfaction guarantee, and I am completely satisfied. <end>  OUTSTANDING  Very impressed with the quality of my item. Delivery was fast. Would definately buy from this seller again <end>
 B0007RXDHI  18k White Gold Classic Trellis Engagement Ring Setting ||	  Overall, very happy...  I am very happy with this setting, overall. The metal was a little bit thinner than I would have hoped, and I didn't realize that "amazon.com" would be imprinted on the ring... but overall I am very happy and would purchase this setting again (here's hoping I won't have to) <end>
 B0007RXKFI  14k White Gold Contour with Ridged Edging Engagement Ring Setting ||	  Picking a Diamond Ring when you have a set budget  Most of us don't have an unlimited budget when it comes to buying an engagement ring. I knew how much I had to spend from the beginning, and buying online really helped when it came to making a decision without the pressure of a sales clerk trying to get you to spend, spend, spend.Having looked into engagement rings on the net for some time, I finally settled on Amazon because (a) they had a H U G E selection of diamonds and (b) their settings were very well priced. I know that people don't like to mix the words "deal", "cheaper", etc with engagement rings, but let me stress that the ring I received is beautiful, and looks every bit the part.How I chose my ring Step one  Choose the setting and subtract the cost from your budget - This will tell you how much you have left for the diamond.I went with the 14k white gold, as I had seen 18k gold and I found it to be quite yellowish. The 14k is a beautiful white silver color, and this setting is very thin and delicate. If your future wife has thin fingers, I would recommend this ring over a wider band that will look clumsier on her hand (my opinion). Also, the thinner the band, the bigger the diamond will look in its setting.Step two  Choose a diamond based on the 4 'C'sThis is where the Amazon diamond selector comes in really useful.The 4 Cs are Cut, Clarity, Colour and Carat.A lot of people believe that bigger is better, but trust me, when it comes to diamonds - it isn't.To narrow down my diamond selection, the first thing I did was choose ranges for the first 3 Cs (a) Clarity - I would recommend SI2/SI1 - This grade of clarity has inclusions that you will see with under 10x magnification. Unless your future wife carries a magnifying glass at all times, you can be pretty sure that noone will be able to see these inclusions....(b) Colour - D-F are considered colourless and can only be told apart by an expert. They are also expensive. G and H are colourless to the untrained eye where I and J have some slight colour (which may be offset by flourescence). Here, I would recommend G or H. You will be getting a diamond which is colourless to the untrained eye.(c) Cut  I would go for Ideal or Very Good. The cut of a diamond determines how the light is reflected and how much the diamond sparkles. A diamond with an ideal cut will look bigger and outshine larger diamonds with an inferior cut.Finally, with the first 3 Cs narrowed down in the amazon diamond selector, I entered my price range and diamond shape (round shape gives you the biggest looking diamond size per carat).On the results page, I -finally- filtered by carat, and chose the biggest carat for the price, having now made sure I was getting an Ideal Cut, G colour, SI2 diamond.Step 3  Add the diamond to your ring, preview and pay. Wait a few days for the delivery man to knock on your door with your beautiful ring.My fianc&eacute;e loved the ring. Her friends loved the ring (most important). I love the ring. <end>
 B0007RXLNO  Platinum Channel-Set Diamond Engagement Ring Setting (1/10 ct tw, J, I1) ||	  Beautiful Engagement Ring  This being the noughties.. being able to do most things online - and with spare time at a premium (not wanting, especially, to go around shopping in over-priced stores), I found Amazon's jewelery section great..(Now, you should go to a shop to get sized...)Amazon's "design-it-yourself" feature is absolutely great!I know that saying that you bought your diamond online is not exactly glamorous - not like going to Tiffany's or Harrod's...But the ring I got from Amazon is lovelier (and less expensive) than many of the rings I see in display around here...The only problem was that we had to ship it to a sister living in Ohio, and she had to bring it over for Christmas in 07.. (No international shipping; we live in Ireland)However, I believe Amazon UK is now selling jewelry, as well..Highly recommended! <end>
 B0007RXLPW  Platinum Channel-Set Diamond Engagement Ring Setting (1/5 ct tw, J, I1) ||	  Elegant Ring  First impression when looked the real ring  wow it's bigger (than the picture showing on Amazon). After I tried it on, the size is about right, but it feels heavy. This is a thick ring and more than I expected. All the diamonds on it are tight and show no sign to drop off. Still, the design is my favorite...maybe just a little bit expensive. <end>
 B0007RXLXY  18k White Gold Concave Engagement Ring Setting ||	  It's not white !!!  I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring in very high resolution.The bad and very bad 1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...5. Engraving on the ring says "Amazon" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this. <end>
 B0007RYJ80  True Blue Bracelet ||	  superb quality  I am going to really enjoy this bracelet. I admit I have 5 or 6 other bracelets (and several necklaces) from these artists and find them to be exceptional quality. The Milagros are charming. The stories that come with them make them very meaningful and great gifts. My favorite bracelet is probably their Art de Corazon double strand but I enjoy them all. This new turquoise one will be wonderful all year long- good in any season. Thank you for your fine work! <end>
 B0007SN8BS  Official Live Strong Lance Armstrong Yellow Cancer LiveSTRONG Rubber Wristband Bracelet ADULT 10 COUNT LOT ||	  Why?  I'm a huge fan of lance's movement and will be taking the livestrong challenge next year.... but you can buy these bands for $1 a piece on the official website. I dont think all the money is going to the foundation from here, someone else is getting a $2 profit on the bands. Please support the actual company and the fight for cancer, not companies on amazon making double profits on these. <end>  RIP OFF!!!!  You can buy it locally for $1 each or buy it at livestrong.com for a dollar each. With the money you spend on these you could have got double!Just so I thought I'd let you know since I made this mistake by making a quick decision. <end>  Great way to show support.  These ara a great way to show support. You can get these for a simple one dollar apiece donation to livestrong. Go there first, and give directly to the cause, rather than the vendor profiteering off their back. <end>  Great product  All you need to be a fan and support Lance's fight. The quality is excellent resistant to daily sun, water and professional outdoor and sportsman <end>
 B0007SV7DO  Pugster Creation Adam By Price Italian Charm ||	  Small but detailed  I was very pleased at the detail of the painting on this charm. There is no question as to what you are looking at. It is a very nice reminder of my trip to Italy and my time at the Sistine Chapel. <end>
 B0007TEJYW  Elegant 2 tone cufflinks with presentation box ||	  Very nice  These cufflinks look very nice. They also look more expensive than what they really are. Also, 2 years later they still look good. <end>

Good Quality for the price.However the beads are VERY pastel except the one dark blue.So if you are looking for the richer cat's eye beads this is notthe braclet for you. From the photo I was expecting darker colors. <end>  Beautiful!!!  My bracelet is even more beautiful than the picture shows. It does not do it justice, seeing it online. The craftsmanship is awesome!!! <end>  Beautiful Bracelet @ a Great Price!

 B0007VUN22  Sterling Silver Cage Blue Moon Cats Eye Pendant Opens ||	  Most Complimented Pendant I Own  I bought this pendant when the other one that I've had on my wish list for eons disappeared and didn't seem to be coming back anytime soon. I'm glad I did as this particular piece has been commented on by so many people, often perfect strangers who've never met me before and rave about the magnificence of this pendant.I chose the 20" sterling silver rope chain to accompany this piece and feel that it does not detract at all from the beauty and elegance of this item.It's just as pictured and even more breathtaking around the neck. It's sturdy, although I wouldn't recommend playing with the clasp as it's not intended for regular "abuse".My son attempted to put a large marble inside but it was too small and "tumbled" about in the cage. However, I would be willing to guess that the blue moon (more of a lavendar) could be interchanged with other similar type of "stones".My single complaint has more to do with the company and nothing reflective of customer service (which has been great both times I've dealt with them) but rather the poor inventory held on hand. I'd really like to see more of these items and see them stick around much longer. <end>  Very beautiful pendant  from the moment I saw this I just needed to have it, it attracted me like a magnet I wear it on a long and heavy silver chain because the pendant itself is heavy and looks on its best when worn on a long chain. I've had a lot of compliments for it is such a unusual piece. I might already have a large collection of silver jewelry but this is one of my favorites. Silver Insanity has many beautiful pieces of jewelry so I guess I will buy some more in the future. <end>  bigger than thought  returned bigger than appeared to be not quite what i was looking for prompt return and refund <end>
 B0007VZLHE  SCER017 Sterling Silver Cream Faux Pearl Threader 2 Inch Ear Wire String Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  String doesn't hang nicely in your ear.  I bought these awhile ago and finally went to wear them the other day and discovered that although they look great, the chain/string is some weird link that doesn't hang nicely in your ear. Box chain would have worked much better. Pity because they would have been great otherwise. <end>  Beautiful and elegant set of pearl ear threaders  I absolutely love these threaders. I have a special love for threaders and these met with my approval. They are very elegant and are great for formal evenings or if you just feel like wearing pearls. They are lightweight and the pearl does not drag the threader out of your ear. I would buy them again. <end>  LOVELY EARRINGS!!  I love these earrings.I have a few pair of the threader earrings, but not with the pearl. They are light, easy to wear. Look even better than I'd expected. Very pleased with purchase and shipping was really quick.Recommend!!! <end>  cute but don't stay in  These are really cute and different, but I never wear them. Since the pearls weigh down one end, they end up sliding out of your ear after just a little while. I have tried putting a back on them (the small round silicone/plastic kind) but the stem is just too thick - they will hardly go on - to the point that it is tough to get them on the end, let alone over the entire stem and then to the chain where I could pull them up behind my earlobe, and who wants to see a plastic earing back hanging there? I recommend the plain silver version of these without added items. <end>  Threads rule!  These are lovely earrings and I bought more than one set. I might even buy all available!Carol <end>
 B0007W5O5W  Sterling Silver Heart Pink Topaz Cubic Zirconia 3mm Solitaire Ring Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  So pretty!  I bought the ring for myself and it came promptly and was a perfect fit.

Then it started to tarnish on the silver. I used silver cleaner and a few other products, but I couldn't get it cleaned. I ended up tossing it. Glad I didn't pay that much for it. <end>  pink ring  It was a pretty ring, but it turned colors on my granddaughters finger. ???The ring itself turned black on the back side, so I wouldn't recommend this ring. <end>  Not impressed  I bought this ring for myself, I wasn't expecting anything glamorous but i was expecting something better. the stone looks like cheap plastic and was loose when it arrived and fell out a week later. the metal is thin and chips easily. i was not impressed with this ring at all. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone over seven years old. <end>  Item as described  Item shipped promptly and arrived on the estimated date. For this price it is a pretty item, good for every day wear. <end>  Beautiful  The ring is as described. Simply stunning! I am currently wearing it and have been since it came in several weeks ago. It has not turned my finger green and does not irritate my skin. A great gift for your daughter, girl friend, fiancee, mom, grandma, etc! I will be doing more business with this company. <end>  cute & sophisticated  )  I bought the ring for my best friend and got myself the cubic zirconia one & they look so good!the rock kinda big but it's supposed to be like that & it's a good price. very satisfied with the purchase  ) <end>

 B0007YD25E  Italian Style Dangly Western Cowboy Boot Sliding Charm ||	  Not an Italian Charm  While this charm is very beautiful, it is NOT an Italian Charm and will not fit as a link in an Italian Charm bracelet, or even in a normal "dangle" charm bracelet. The the picture of this item is decieving. <end>
 B0007YQHVK  Italian Sterling Silver Chain 9 10 11 inch Anklet ||	  Beautiful Anklet  This ankle bracelet was purchased to replace one I broke. I never thought I would find one I liked as much as the one I broke. However this anklet exceeded my expectations. It is exactly what I wanted. I love it and wear it all the time <end>  Like it a lot  Bought it maybe a year ago, its still holding up very beautifully.It can really go with any toe ring and fits my ankle nicely =)&lt;3 That's really all I can say about it! ^_^ <end>  So happy with purchase  "I've been looking for a longer anklet for awhile and was so pleased when I saw this. The price is great and the anklet is beautiful. Very shiny and good durability. " <end>  Beautiful  great anklet, sturdy. I've been wearing it months through showers, baths, tanning beds and multiple lotion applications, and it still looks great. I would say this runs just slightly smaller then the listed length, just a touch so that it does bind if your a bigger girl. <end>  nice bracelet  sturdy, attractive, sparkly. Holds up well so far. Nice clasp, which holds it secure. Easy to put on and off. <end>  Ankle Bracelet  Loved it exactly what it advertised a quality item. I was very pleased with the product. Great value for the price. <end>  What a deal and so cute!  The anklete is really cute, just the right size. I bought it for myself and wear it all the time. What a great deal! <end>  Happy with the fit.  I always have trouble finding the right fit for anklets so I wasn't optimistic with ordering this one but for the price, I didn't think it would be a total loss if I got it and it didn't fit. First, it came super fast which is great. And I am happy to report it fits! I have Samoan ankles so it's not easy finding my size lol.I love it so much I'm ordering another one. Very happy customer!! <end>  Love my ankle bracelet!  It is exactly as described...Love it! Received it quickly...easy transaction. I would highly recommend this to others. Thanks very much! <end>  Disappointed  I was disappointed when it arrived. First of all it was tarnished. The silver had black lines all around it after just coming out of the package and I understand silver does do this overtime but it should not do it before I even get it. And the 10" was way to big. Just disappointed in general. Hopefully Amazon will give me a refund and I can buy one elsewhere. <end>  ankle bracelet  I love my ankle bracelet! This one was purchased for my best friend because I loved mine so much! Very well made and beautiful! <end>  Great anklet - great price  I love this anklet. It's pretty dainty, really shiny, and fits nice below the ankle. It's a great everyday summer piece! <end>  great product  I purchase 4 of these. They are great. I need the longer length and these are just what I wanted. I wear ankle bracelets all the time and they break. The one I started with has not broken yet and is in great shape. <end>  Prettier in Real-Life  These anklets are very pretty, the photo from the seller does not do the anklets justice. I have been very pleased with these anklets and I would recommend buying more than one to anyone who is interested in wearing anklets. <end>  Enjoying this anklet!  This was the first time I bought an anklet on line and it is exactly how it is described. I have a hard time finding the longer size, and I was a little leary about the quality. I am pleased to find that the length is perfect and the quality is very good. I really enjoy this product and hope the get other anklets of this length and quality in their stock. <end>  Sturdy, affordable and offered in hard to find size 11 inch!  I found this while shopping for a little ankle bracelet to wear this summer with my capris and sandals. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but also wanted something that wouldn't break from normal wear. This silver anklet turned out to be perfect.Because of it's design, it rolls smoothly on the leg, and there no design or charm to get flipped over or off center. I have been wearing mine for a week straight, through shopping, working, showers, sleeping, etc, and it hasn't fallen off or broken yet.It comes in several sizes, which I appreciate. Nice size 11 anklets are often hard to find. I also plan to pick this up in a 10 inch, since the 11 inch sits low on my foot (which is how I like to wear them with sandals and I would also like one that sits higher for when I'm wearing tennis shoes.)Highly recommended for anyone looking for a low maintenance, good quality, highly affordable anklet that comes in a nice variety of sizes.*** I have added a more detailed picture of this anklet to the Amazon images at the top of this page to give a better view of how it looks when wearing it. *** <end>  PERFECT  I recently broke my anklet and have been looking for one like it for several weeks...I saw this one and it was exactly like my old one and in the right size. When I received it, it was PERFECT!!!! I was so happy, I put it on and it hasn't been off yet. I am going to by a couple more plus some braclets...I love this website. The sterling silver is gorgeous-looks tasteful. I love the lobster clasp as well. I have already shown several of my friends and given them this website!!! Thanks for having great products and great service <end>  happy customer  I purchased the anklet and was extremely happy when it arrived. So much more eye pleasing when you can see it and touch it. Awesome deal!!! <end>  loved it  Loved the anklet. The first time I wore socks I forget I was wearing it and broke the clasp when I removed my socks. Accidently hooked the chain and yanked too hard. Totally my fault. I will be ordering another one. <end>  Beautiful Anklet  I absolutely LOVE this anklet. The fit is comfortable, but it's so pretty to look at. I find myself staring at it constantly while I wear it. It's eye-catching, quite stunning in my view. Premium sterling silver quality at a great price. I never go anywhere without it! <end>  Very Dainty Anklet  This is a very nice ankle braclet. Very simple looking but pretty. My only complaint is even though it says a 9" it was a bit shy of that. <end>  Nice unique design  I purchased this anklet for myself it has a really nice unique design with the balls and the bars in between. I recently had a guy comment on my anklet which I would have to say it was the first. haha Glad I purchased this design. <end>
 B0007YSFUG  Black CZ and Synthetic Opal Sterling Dolphin Pendant ||	  A Unique Version of the Dolphin Pendant!  This is lovely....Different than what you usually see in the marketplace. I bought two for teen girls for xmas & was not disappointed when received .... I know they're going to love them! <end>  wow, what a beauty!  I got this pendant today and could see why the other reviewer was so excited. It's so pretty and shiny, looks more like white gold and the price is just amazing, these make wonderful holiday gifts, it also comes so cutely packaged, go for it before they sell out. <end>  WOW, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PENDANT IN THE WORLD  I can't BELIEVE THAT THIS PENDANT WAS 25 BUCKS. iT LOOKS AT LEAST 250$ tHE PHOTO DOES NOT DO IT JUSTIC. THE PENDANT IS A GREAT SIZE, THE METAL LOOKS LIKE WHITE GOLD, THE BLACK CZ'S FOR THE EYES SPARKLE, AND THE OPAL OH MY GOSH LET ME TELL YOU THIS BLUE OPAL MAY B SYNTHETIC BUT IT LOOKS BETTER THAN A REAL OPAL. BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH "FIRE" IN AN OPAL STONE IT GLITTERS AND IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. I FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE GOTTON THIS PEICE. I LOVE DOLPHINS AND MY WHITE GOLD DOLPHIN EARRINGS WILL LOOK GREAT WITH THIS PENDANT. RHODIUM IS HARD TO FIND. IT'S A GOOD QUALITY METAL THAT'S IN THE PLATINUM FAMILY. IT IS THE WHITE GOLD LOOK, AND PREVENTS TARNISH SCRATCHING AND BENDING. I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PENDANT. THE SHIPMENT WAS QUICK AND IT CAME IN THIS ADORABLE EXPENSIVE JEWELRY POUCH THAT IS A BRIGHT YELLOW, AND IT CAME TO ME FREE WITH MY PENDANT. I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS PENDANT. OUT OF ALL MY PENDANTS, AND MANY DO I HAVE, THIS IS MY FAVORITE. AS YOU CAN TELL I'M A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER. THIS IS A GREAT DEAL AND PRICE ALONG WITH QUALITY AND BEAUTY. THEY ARE PRACTICALY GIVING IT AWAY. I'D GET IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU LIKE DOLPHINS YOU'LL BE THRILLED WHEN YOU SEE IT IN PERSON. <end>  Very cute double dolphin blue opal pendant  It is very cute! I love the smooth shiny luster. It does look like white gold, but then again I can't tell the difference between white gold and sterling silver. They both look the same to me. It is very nicely made of excellent quality...it does look expensive. It is hollowed out in the back, but the metal is very thick. Has some weight to it. I love the black eyes...there is another seller who sells the same pendant for more money, and that one has clear white zirconia's. I like the black zirconia's on this much more. They show up better, and besides, dolphins eyes do appear black. The pendant is a little over an inch long and about a half inch wide. I don't know if they are all like this but my pendant's blue opal is not very intense blue like it shows in the photo. I like the one in the photo. Mine has a milkiness or foggyness to it. I wish it was more blue, but I'm not going to return it. It's still a beautiful pendant and I do love it. I guess every one will have a slight difference, like not every stone is exactly the same. My pendant did not come with a bright yellow pouch like one of the reviewers mentioned. It only came with a white box for gift-giving, which is too big for the pendant. It's a box big enough for a bracelet. The necklace did come with a twisted rope/black satin cord that you have to put the pendant on yourself. It has a loop on one end and a knot on the other so it should't fall open when you wear it. I hope not! I'd hate to lose such a gorgeous pendant! For the price I recomment this. <end>
 B0007YT50K  Emerald Colored Pendant Necklace Indian glass beads ||	  It got character!  I appreciate this necklace and the company I ordered it from. It expresses the beauty of green so well that I'd like to know who designed it. The necklace indeed got its character. It's a piece of art, I'd like to say. <end>  Indian glass bead necklace  This is a lovely piece of jewelry. I was very happy with the product, the packaging (a nice satin draw string bag) and the shiping/delivery time.I would buy from this vendor again for sure. <end>  Not really Emerald Colored But Still Lovely  I bought this as a gift for a very girly eight-year-old niece. She loves it, and it looks beautiful on her. It is more golden-green than emerald-colored, though. The picture is actually a pretty good representation of the color.The necklace is well-made and sturdy enough for a careful older child. <end>
 B0007YVB6Q  Emerald Colored Multistrand Collar Necklace w/Glass Beads ||	  My wife loves it!  It is as nice as it looks on the internet; really. <end>  Gorgeous! Very "high end"!  This necklace is stunning! Nobody would ever believe it costs less than 15.00! Really, absolutely beautiful! <end>  So many compliments...  My in-laws got this necklace for me and people ask me where I got it all the time. I get more compliments on this necklace than any other I own (and I own a lot of necklaces). I felt that it was a bit bulkier than what is pictured here so keep that in mind. Regardless, this is my favorite necklace. <end>
 B0007YVB7A  Onyx Colored Pendant Necklace W/beads [Limited Time Blowout Offer] ||	  Good Value  Good value for price. I believe that it's made of plastic, doesn't seem to be made of any type of stone. <end>  disappointing  looks beautiful out of the bag but it broke twice already and even though my beau fixed it both times, I am very leery of wearing outWill return this <end>  Pretty peice, but up close kind of cheap  I Liked the necklace a lot, and for what I paid, a great buy. Yet the beds look cheap up close. Then, again I don't plan on anyone inspecting it. <end>
 B0007YYG36  Yellow-gold Black Hills Gold Angel Tie-tac/ Lapel-pin ||	  Guardian Angel  The pin was better than I expected and better than the picture of it. It arrived sooner than they said it would, I am pleased with the entire transaction. <end>
 B0007Z1UFW  14KY Gold Flower Earring Jacket 13mm Diameter ||	  Smaller than I thought.  I had the choice of "small" jackets or jackets. I bought the jackets thinking there were regular sized and I could get my pearls to seat in them. They ended up being too small for the pearl size I would use in them, so I gave them to my little niece. Perfect for a little girl, not perfect for a big girl ;-D. <end>  gift for wife  My wife wanted a jacket for her diamond studs. These really fit the bill. They were exactly as advertised.The delivery was promt product arrived in perfect condition. <end>
 B0007Z6TF8  Sterling Silver And Peridot Drop Necklace By Zina, 17" ||	  Sterling Silver and Peridot Drop Necklace  I bought this as a lightening deal and couldn't be happier with it. I haven't worn a drop necklace before and it's a fun piece. You definitely know that you have a necklace on as there is a bit of weight to it but it's not cumbersome. The circular pieces are about the size of a 5m pearls and separated evenly by small silver balls. The silver with black swirls make it versatile to wear with just about everything. I like the hint of peridot-it's just enough to tease but not overwhelm. I'm very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Zina jewelry is unique  There are two things that rate the four star rating; the stones are too few and too small for the price, and the chain above the swirled pieces is rather weak. I would have liked some adjustability in the length. All that said, this is a beautiful piece and I look forward to wearing it for many years. <end>
 B0007Z6TGC  Sterling Silver And Blue Topaz Drop Earrings By Zina ||	  This was a great choice of a present  My little sister, whom I gave this to for a present loved it. the workmanship on the earings is great and the pictures don't do the stones justice. These are great earings that are youthfull yet classy. <end>
 B0007Z6TKI  14k Yellow Gold Curved Bar Dangle Earrings ||	  Dainty and feminine  I bought these pale gold dangly earrings for a close friend's birthday present and she was really pleased with them. They are dressy enough for the office and casual enough to wear with a tee shirt and jeans. The end tip of the dangle hangs approximately to the mid jaw line--just below the ear. They are reasonably priced and the post and anchor style ensures that they won't slide out of your ear (as they are rather light). Good value for the money. <end>

 B0007ZFX3W  Sterling Silver Irish Wolfhound Dog Pendant ||	  Good quality that looks just like our dog.  We have a &#34;rescue&#34; which was supposed to be a Giant Schnauzer but turned out to be more of an Irish Wolfhound. This pendant looks just like her. <end>
 B0007ZFZKS  Sterling Silver English Cocker Spaniel Dog Pendant ||	  A Gift Worth Giving  I bought this pendant as a gift, worried that it might not be as high quality as I wanted for the price. However, the composition was exactly what I wanted, so I ordered it, knowing I could always return it. My fears were put to rest when it arrived for the detailing was just as clear in person as in the photograph provided, if not better. The craftsmanship is beautiful, much better than I expected for the price I paid. This is an excellent piece of sterling silver jewelry. Do note that this is for the charm only, no chain included, but that's to be expected for the price involved. <end>
 B0007ZMC4K  Irish Friendship & Love Band Celtic Claddagh Ring in Sterling Silver, Sizes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, #2601 ||	  Great ring, great price  The ring is beautiful, so much so that when my teenage daughter cracked and broke hers after a lot of abuse, she requested this same version of the Claddagh. Something even more important to me is this is one of almost a dozen items I've purchased from this company from jewelry to a fabulous mortar and pestle set. Shipping is quick, items are exactly as stated. Taos is trust worthy and I am very, very happy with every item I've purchased from them. <end>  Could not be happier  I bought this ring as a present for valentines day for my girlfriend. I was a little worried about ordering a ring off of the internet for two reasons. One I was worried about the overall quality of the ring matching the picture, which it did. The other being if the size was not correct how would the customer assistance be and it was GREAT. The ring was great quality it was more on the petite side which I like. My girlfriend could not be happier with it. She has problems with nickel based jewelry and it is, like they state nickel-free. I got the size right, twice and they could not have been more helpful in fixing this error they not only sent me a new one quickly and were more then helpful making sure I got exactly what I had wanted. Thank you Taos. <end>  Absolutely love this!!  I have been looking for one of these that I like for a while and this one is it! It came quickly and well wrapped and I LOVE it! I wear it every day! <end>  Beautiful Ring!!  If you thought the details on this ring were the most beautiful one on this website, you'd so be right! The ring's detailing is amazing, and everything on the ring is perfectly proportional. I ended up giving my ring to my mom because it was a bit too big (I guess I measured my size wrong).Now this ring isn't made in Ireland (Thailand), but I've had claddagh ring from Ireland (but I lost that while I was moving), and the detail was nowhere near the quality of the detail that's on this ring. The hand shape is especially well crafted.I definitely recommend this product! <end>  Classic - Traditional - Beautiful - JUST PERFECT!  This claddagh ring looks exactly as to what the picture displays. I love it! I've always wanted one (since I was little) because I'm of Irish descent.Now I don't agree at all with the comment saying it's big and masculine looking for a woman. I personally have very small, slender & dainty hands (I get comments all the time on how TINY my hands are...) and this ring looks perfect on my very feminine hand, it's not over powering or bulky.Personally the sizing for me was a little off. I measured my ring finger and said that I was a size 6. Which is what I ordered...I knew I should have went for a size 5!! -keep that in mind just in case.In the end I wasn't too concerned with sending it back for an exchange in size because it does fit my middle finger perfectly. <end>  He loved it!  I had been searching for a Claddagh righ for a while and I came across this one. It was just what I wanted. When my boyfriend got the ring he loved it! He thought it was nice that it told him what it meant, since he didn't know the meaning of it. All around a great gift to buy. &lt;3 <end>  Claddagh Ring  I purchased 3 claddagh rings as purity rings for my 3 girls. They are beautiful rings. One I ordered was too large (our mistake in measuring). The company made it easy to return and promptly sent us our new ring. <end>  Very pleased.  I am so very pleased with this purchase. The ring is beautifully designed and exactly what I was hoping for. Even the ordering process was pleasing. It arrived quickly and even came in a box with a brief history of the claddagh and a jewelry cloth to keep it in good condition. I highly recommend this seller. <end>  Irish Friendship Claddagh Ring  Loved this ring. It arrived exactly as pictured. I bought it for my 13-year old daughter for Christmas. She wears it all the time, and receives many compliments/questions about it. It feels very solid, not like some flimsy ones we've seen at stores that cost double the price. (She's wanted one ever since she was watching old episodes of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" on DVD, and saw Angel give Buffy a beautiful ring like this.) <end>  Claddagh Ring  Ordered it for my girlfriend. It came quickly and is very pretty compared to other claddagh rings I have seen. Everything is just in perfect proportion to each other. The shine has faded a bit since I got it three months ago... but it's still loved.EDIT  My girlfriend at the time ended up getting one for me as well (we are both female). We aren't together anymore, but it's been years and it still looks great. I wear it very often. The only thing that shows poor quality is that the band has kind of bent into an oval shape (I guess to form-fit to my finger). It's very comfortable and well worth the money. <end>  Traditionally, tasefully beautiful  A lot of modern makers of Claddagh rings seem to think that the traditional design isn't good enough, and that they have to add more "style." I wouldn't have a problem with that if their styles were not very often bulky, graceless, or downright ugly.Here, however, we have a ring that is elegantly small and tastefully designed. There are no strangely deformed hands or oversized hearts. Everything is very nicely in proportion, and small enough that it looks very good on even the slightest woman's finger (trust me on that one, the woman for whom I bought this has such slight fingers, size 5 is almost too big for her). Also, the silver is cheerfully bright, something the picture does not convey well enough. After consistent daily use, we can see no sign of tarnish or of wear on the inside.This ring is one of the most traditionally, tastefully beautiful Claddagh rings I've seen, and for the price, it just can't be beaten. Just be careful which hand you wear it on! <end>  You've stumbled across a fantastic ring!  I've been looking for a good sized Claddagh ring for some time now all over the internet and I'm so glad that I decided to go with this one! The ring is a good size, not too large for a woman, and the design is beautiful! I love it! It's a fantastic ring, with a fantastic price! <end>  She Loved It  I got this ring for my girlfriend as a birthday present, and she loved it. The only problem she had was deciding what finger to wear it on. I also really liked how the order came with a catalog and a business card for future orders. <end>  Better than I expected  My dad got this ring for me, so he's letting me write this review on his account.I love this ring! The two pictures of it on here don't do it justice. When I got it, it was nicely packaged in a little baggie inside a white cardboard box with foam, and it fit perfectly. Everything is proportional--no disturbingly large heart or deformed hands, and the silver doesn't tarnish easily. However, it's fairly malleable and easy to scratch if you're not careful. I got a little scratch mark on the surface of the heart, and it's not really noticeable to anyone (except myself) but it still kind of bothers me. Even if I end up breaking it I'll probably buy another of the same.  ) <end>  This is the best of them all!!!!  I love this ring!!! It is light, delicate and feminine as they get. I had gotten another claddaugh ring here on Amazon, but it was soooo big and clunky that I had to return it. I am all about wearing feminine jewelry and this ring was just exactly what I was looking for. It is sturdy yet so very, very feminine at the same time. When you look at it on the hand, you know it's a ladies' ring!!! The only thing I wish all the silversmiths would do is to make rings by .5, like 6.5, 7.5 etc. Six is a little too tight, but a seven is too loose for my liking and loose rings drives me nutz. <end>  Love it!  I love my new ring! It came earlier then the estimated delivery date. It's a moderately small size, definitly delicate enough for a woman. It looks just like it does in the picture. I was concerned about sizing, and that the nine would be too small, but it fits perfectly! When I used the sizing chart, I measured a comfterably loose ring, and was a size ten. However, this ring I bought in a nine and it fits perfectly, with a comfterable amount of space. I would definitly reccomend this ring! <end>  3 years later...  The ring is in perfect condition 3 years after purchase. Plus!, I got it for half the current price, though I would still pay the current price for it.Great buy. <end>  High quality ring for a low price  I bought this ring as a gift for a friend. She liked it so much she has since become my girlfriend! Ok, well, she didn't become my girlfriend because of the ring, but she does really like it, and I had no hesitation in giving it to her because the craftsmanship was very impeccable. She loves wearing it and I wish other jewelry I had bought in the past was the same quality. I know with care this claddagh ring will last a lifetime and beyond. <end>  Yay!  This is such a pretty little ring! Even on my small hands it doesn't overpower. I had even accidentally ordered one that was too big, but Taos called me and gladly traded it for a smaller one. I'd gladly buy from them again! <end>  Beautiful Ring - Just as pictured  There are a lot of different styles of claddagh rings, and honestly a lot of them look like junk. The hands often look more like oven mits and the heart looks like a lumpy rock.The detail in this ring is great, looks just like the picture, and scored major points for me with my girlfriend. Definitely a good buy, especially for the price. <end>  Better than I expected  I literally ordered this ring two days ago with regular shipping and it is on my finger right now... Amazingly fast delivery. It's exactly what I had envisioned when looking at the picture and seems sturdy and high quality. I'm very pleased with my purchase and will definitely order from Taos again! <end>  Disappointed  I called Taos Trading in Jan. for the sizing of the ring, and they told me they will call me in Feb. when they get more size 7's in. It is now march, and i have not gotten any phone calls. I'm disappointed, i was looking forward to buying the ring. <end>  beautiful  I ordered this ring for my daughter. It arrived before the expected time and looked exactly as pictured. <end>  Love Claddagh Ring  'Irish Friendship / Love Claddagh Ring in Sterling Silver size 6, #2601-6'Beautiful ring, which I get compliments on. Delivery was prompt. <end>  Absolutly Beautiful  I bought this for my best friend for her birthday. It came and it was so lovely that I had to give it to her as soon as I got it. She loves it and I would recomend this ring with no regrets. <end>  Looks nice, but....  This ring looks nice, but in person it is a bit big and masculine looking for a woman. Quality appears to be pretty good and sizing seems right as well. The image makes it look more delicate than it is. I still like it though and have worn it almost every day since I bought it. (I had no problems with the seller and it arrived a day before expected delivery). <end>  Beautiful!  I purchased this ring for my mother as part of her Christmas present. We are part Irish and she has always loved that culture. Her dream vacation would be to go but since we could not afford to take her there, I could at least bring some of it to her. The ring was beautiful. No tarnish or blatant signs of cheapness, clear design, good color to the silver. It runs very true to size and was way more delicate in real life than what it looks like in the picture but I love that about it. The only draw back is that the inside is very clearly stamped THAILAND on the band which I'm sure says something about it's quality or it's origins, and I was a little disappointed over that. All in All I am satisfied with it  ) <end>  Definitely worth it  I love this product, I had gotten this for my girlfriend as one of our anniversary presents since she was somewhat into rings, when I showed it to her, she loved it. its been about 6-7 months since I gave it to her, and it is still in perfect condition, she told me it never left any stains on her fingers at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to give this as a gift, they will love it ( <end>  Beautiful and delicate  I purchased this for a friend who has always wanted a Claddagh ring. This one is far and away the best I've seen in this price range. Beautifully designed and manufactured. Very delicate features. Highly recommended. <end>  Graduation Gift  Great craftsmanship!Our daughter has been wanting one of these rings ever since she first seen it on Buffy.And she loves it!She also has the matching necklace. Thanks! <end>  ily it  I got the ring and I absolutely love it! it came a day earlier than it was supposed to and its the perfect size! Its also super comfy and super shiny! I love it and i would recommend it to anyone who wants one <end>  Great Looking Ring  I got this ring as a gift for someone. I noticed the reviews were very complimentary so I went with it. I am very glad I did. This ring is very nice and has a great size and very detailed look. I checked at places like walmart, target, and kohls and for being the same price they were extremely inferior. The 1 I saw at kohls which was $40 looked like it was made out of plastic. I checked the 1s made in ireland as well and this 1 is even better than that. Don't let the being made in Thailand thing throw you, its the best example of a classic claddagh ring I have seen. The seller also was very fast in shipping this out. I ordered late on a Monday evening and recieved by Friday. I don't normally review things, but this def deserved it. I highly recommend. <end>  Simple and perfect!  This ring is simple, but that is exactly what I wanted. I have been able to wear it while doing household chores, such as laundry and dishes, and it seems to be able to withstand those chemicals. It's really a great choice if you want something simple but sweet. <end>  Love love this ring!  This high quality Claddagh ring was the perfect Christmas gift! My daughter loved everything about it from it's high polished shine to the way it feels on her hand. She has had many complements and wears it everyday. I would buy from this seller again. Fast shipping and packaged nicely too! Thank you! <end>  just what i was looking for  i've been looking for a claddagh ring that suited my personal taste for quite a while. this one immediately jumped out at me, unlike all the other styles i've seen. it is just the right balance between delicacy and strength. just be careful about sizing your finger properly. <end>  Perfect  This ring is absolutely gorgeous. It was supposed to be delivered between Thursday and Tuesday - it arrived Wednesday, a day early, safely packaged.  )The ring seems durable, and is absolutely beautiful. Definitely not too large for a woman, it seems feminine and sweet. I'm so excited to wear it every day. If you're going for a claddagh ring at a decent price, this is definitely the one. <end>  I Love my ring!  Thank you for the beautiful ring! I wear it all the time! I would definitely recommend this item and the price was very inexpensive.  ) Check out the seller's website! <end>  Not Made in Ireland  It's a pretty ring, but it's not made in Ireland...it has Thailand stamped on the inside of the band. I would much rather have had a REAL Irish Claddagh. <end>  Great value  I ordered three of these rings based on other people's reviews. They are very pretty, a nice weight, and everyone loved them! I would recommend this ring. <end>  Amazing!  Shipping was fast! The ring size fit perfectly, the price was good, and the ring is just gorgeous. I agree with others that this design is one of the better Claddagh rings. <end>  Daughter Loved It  Got this for a birthday present for my teenage daughter and she loved it. It is just what she wanted. Good quality and reasonable price. <end>  I love this ring!!!  I absolutely love my new ring!! Sterling silver rings I've bought in the past have always scratched, but this ring has remained as polished as it looked when it first arrived! I would definitely recommend this ring and I would definitely buy from this company again. Excellent service and a VERY speedy delivery. <end>
 B0007ZNJRE  Antique Silver Victorian Heart Pink Gem Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Unbelievable find!  I purchased this ring in December of 2005 and am now shopping for another one to replace it. Since I never wore dangled belly rings before, I figured this was a decent length and small enough not to pinch and poke. The dangle took a little getting used to, and the charm will require a turn here and there. But the price, durability and comfort make this belly ring an amazing find! <end>
 B0007ZP57Q  Tagliamonte Classics Collection - Pearls & Rubies 18K Gold Ring USA 4 | UK H | IT 7 ||	  Not well made for the price.  For an item that is so expensive, this ring is not as well made as I would have expected. Specifically, the side "columns" are not even in length. Also, the cab rubies are not uniform in color. I just had the feeling that I was paying more for the name of the designer than for the quality of the ring. <end>
 B0007ZRZII  Sterling Silver Dichroic Glass Pendant ||	  Sterling Silver Dichroic Glass Pendant  These dichroic pendants are breath-taking. So, unique, so versatile... they look great with a businesssuit, or anything casual. The silver in these pendants is very high-quality, the best I've seen in a verylong time. <end>
 B000804H60  Ruby Red Iced Chandelier Dangle Belly Button Ring ||	  Awewsome  I bought this for my younger sister, she had her first prom and it matched her dress (which was a midrift bearing dress) perfectly, the product was described perfectly and it is still in great condition and it has been almost 6 months <end>
 B00080MYOM  Cubic Zirconia Eternity Wedding Band ||	  nothing like picture  I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS RING-IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL ONLINE-BUT IN PERSON IS A FLIMSY-CZ-THAT LOOKS LIKE A VENDING MACHINE RING,IT IS DECEIVING.IF YOU WANT A NICE BAND-DON'T BUY THIS ONE. <end>  not as good as it looks  I gotthis ring but I do not like it because it snags on everything like clothing and your skin. I do not suggest anyone to buythis ring. <end>
 B00080Q2KY  Sterling Silver Stud and Hoop Earring Set ||	  Simple, easy, inexpensive , usable, and givable!  These earings are just very simple, useful, easy, inexpensive, and simply a good thing to have around when you want to have something casual, and easy on. Good buy. <end>
 B00080Q2M2  14k White Gold Round-Cut Diamond Channel-Set Hoop Earrings ||	  Well worth the dollars  These are a great pair of earrings for the dollar. They are perfect small hoops that can be dressed up or dressed down but still elegant. They are not huge diamond blingy earrings, and if that is what you want then you should choose another pair. <end>  Brightness  The Earrings are a delight, thus far the quality of the earrings how people asking me where did I purchase such quality and explicit earrings <end>  Stylish, but not overwhelming!  The only thing I dislike about the hoops is that their back side is hollow and you cannot see it on the photos-this makes them very light-weight. Nevertheless, they look very dainty and sophisticated, the "rocks" aren' that sparkly, but with the clarity stated in the description they aren't supposed to be. I like them a lot coz they are perfect for everyday - the reason why I bought them. Be realistic! If you want to get a pair of great quality, nice weight hoops with quality diamonds - shell out at least 1K.P.S. These would be great for girls from 5 and up. <end>  how i rate this  I was bought this present for valentines day. It's pretty. I do wear them for everyday use <end>  Absolutely Teeny  They could not be any smaller, the diamonds or the earrings. I should have known better. <end>  hoops  The ones I received wouldn't lock anbd were bent. I need an address to return them and get a refund. I don't have the receipt. <end>  Cute and Dainty  I received this pair of hoop earrings as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. When I first open the box, I thought they were earrings for an infant. The earrings are very very small; however, they are cute. As I started wearing the earrings, I began to really like them. They are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession. If you really like dainty jewelry, I highly recommend this item. <end>  affordable diamond gift  I was looking for an affordable diamond gift and this fit the bill. I like the quality and workmanship. My wife loves it and we haven't had any workmanship problems. The diamonds face forward for all to admire. It is a great set of earrings. <end>  VERY small.  These earrings, while cute, are extremely small. I can't even put the TIP of my pinky finger through the hoop. <end>  Cute & pretty, a little small but just what I wanted  If you're looking for big hoops or large super-duper quality diamonds, then look elsewhere. But if you're looking for some really cute diamond & white gold hoops and aren't looking to spend an arm & a leg, then I recommend these. I love them. I've got a relatively small frame and these are perfectly sized. They're dainty, and they work as nicely with a t-shirt and jeans as they do with dressier clothes. The diamonds are quite small and aren't of exceptional quality (J Color & I2 clarity), but they're pretty clear in color and who cares if there are imperfections in diamonds of this size (is someone really going to bust out the gem hoop & look at your ears that close?) & diamonds any bigger would have (in my opinion) looked silly or gaudy in hoops of this size.These are exactly what I was looking for  something a little delicate in look but sturdy in construction, a little sparkly but not too too much, and real white gold & diamonds without a really high price tag. I really like these earrings and wear them often. <end>  very plaesed  I gave this item as a gift(uncle's wife), and she loved them.She doesnt wear big earrings ,so she stated that they were perfect. <end>  Very pretty, catches the eye.  Prompt delivery. Good quality. Well worth the price. Actually just the right size for all occasions. Many complements on them. Thank you, Kathi Abbott <end>  Small But Elegant  While I liked the item and the person who rec'd the item liked them as well, I can understand why some feel they are small. Do not purchase if you intend to 'wow' or 'amaze' the recipient. These serve as excellent second earrings next to diamond studs. <end>  Very pretty.  My husband travels and was out of town on my birthday. He ordered these and had them delivered to my work. They are smaller than I really like, but they are very nice. They are sturdy. Being small has it's advantages, though. They don't get caught in my hair and they do shimmer. I've worn them every day since I got them. I like the idea that they are something I can pass on to a granddaughter one day. Many reviews said they were flimsy. They are old reviews. Mine are great! If you were disappointed because they were too small, you either didn't read the description and reviews or they were a gift! <end>  small earrings  i bought two pairs for my girlfrind she loves them they are nicely crafted and i would buy more <end>  Is as described...  After ordering these I couldn't help but feel like I was duped when I read other peoples reviews and found most people said they were so small. Well, I was relieved when I received thes earings, they were what I thought they would be. Some people said these would be better for an infant but I dont agree. Baby earings are tiny, these are not huge but not tiny. I upoaded pictures to put this to rest. They are excactly the size as described 13.15mm which equals 0.517717 inches. The quality is also very nice and they have a very nice weight for there size which convinces me that the body is not hollow. Im not an expert, but under magnification the diamonds are evenly spaced and set deep into the body, the jewels are not set like a ring, the metal was cast around them. Clarity is advertised as a 2 but is not a concern with a diamond of this size and cut, Good price for VF-J diamonds set in 14k. I almost want to give this product 5 stars for not only my expectation of them but that they arrived in less than 20 hrs and shipping was free. But I can not give this a perfect 5 star because the presentation box is absolutley wrong for presenting diamonds. The rings are at the very top of the case in the shade and the box is big enough to present a necklace, making the earings seem even smaller. Also the velvet was linty which can be addressed with a bit of tape but I will find another way to foward my gift to my love. <end>  don't buy these  I was flabbergasted when I opened the box with these earrings in them. They are so incredibly small in diameter they should only be ordered for a child. <end>  Small don't have an accurate exact size photo on add  They shouldshow actual size somewhere in the add not give you dimensionsthat are in metric so that you can tell what they actually look like' They are extremely small and the picture even though it is of them is blown up to make them look better I may be returning them if my wife doesn't want them as they are small and hard to see. I personally think they are not worth what was charged for them. <end>  Great earrings  Definitely recommend this, i like small earrings and this are perfect! If you are looking for some small earrings this ones are really good <end>  Diamond Channel Set Hoops...Need good eyes  I would not recommend this product. From pictures used to advertise this product, it looks like you can see the individaul diamonds. This is completely not the case. I could not make out the individual diamonds at all, they are way too. Not only are the diamonds small, the earings are small. This product is overpriced and and would not be something you would want to give someone as a meaningful gift because you simply cannot see what the earrings really look like. Andrew <end>  Too Small  Returned the merchandize....too small for the asking price...seen better deal on shopping on line....Returning the item was easy and fast... <end>  Petite earrings  The price and look was right but the reviews were conflicted. They are a bit on the small side, but just right as a bright and glitterly accent. I did decide to keep this earrings and wear them for either dressy or casual occasions. <end>  Very Nice  Very nice earrings at a good price. Cant be beat. Great quality. Sad my wife lost one already though lol... again. <end>  Beautiful but SMALL  I bought this as a gift, but when I received them they would have been too small to fit. I wanted to keep them myself, because they were so pretty. <end>  Nice  These are great earrings for what you pay for it. They are small but can be dressed and are always elegant. <end>  VERY SMALL  These earings were ok quality,but were really small. They would be better suited for a child. <end>  can't go wrong with these  You can't go wrong with these, hoops are small but not too small, hard to find look of white and yellow gold, diamond cutting catches the light, and the price was right. These are fast becoming my go-to everyday earrings. <end>  Nice but small...  Enjoyed the quality of the errings, but i thought they were a little larger. I'm a simple person and these are nice, simple and elegent. If you are looking for larger hoops, these are small, but nice. <end>  Was just too small!  I bought this pair of earings for my wife as a surprise gift! But i got the surprise when i recieved the earrings. They were just too small and did not look exactly like the image or was too small for me see the design. It was too small that the gems could not even be seen properly. Maybe i shuold have paid attention to the sizing information. Unfortunately, i don't have a baby daughter, these could be a baby size! <end>  Very Nice  Very nice earrings at a good price. Cant be beat. Great quality. Sad my wife lost one already though lol... again. She has both these and the yellow gold ones. <end>  Not So Pleased  Product is very attractive; however, too small and flimsy for the price. Aditionally, item is too small compared to actual. <end>  disappointed  When I received the earrings I got very disappointed because they are very very small. I had to sell them, my wife never wanted to wear them. <end>  Didn't like it at all  The diamonds are waaayyy too small. Nothing like the picture. Sent it back. <end>  Beautiful earrings  They are small, but sparkly and look very cute. My 15 year old loves it, and wears it every day. <end>  They're small  I purchased these for my wife for Christmas. They came packaged in a necklace box, which made them look even smaller. They were as described which is why I gave them four stars, but when my wife saw how much they cost she made me return them. They looked nice, they are just really small. <end>  Jewelry is MUCH smaller than it appears in Photograph!  Will never shop for jewelry on Amazon again. Twice, I have been given expensive earings only to find that they are sized for a small child, not an adult. Last year my son purchased chocolate diamond earings. This year, my husband purchased the diamond earings. They are very tiny. He could not believe his eyes and apologized. <end>
 B000817JGE  Two Tone Trendy Diamond Ring Guard Enhancer (Center ring is not included) ||	  two-tone 14K gold ring guard  Just what I've been looking for! A very lovely designer look in ring guards. A very nice change from all white or all yellow gold! Been to a jewelers for sizing and even they said it was a nice find! <end>
 B00081NCCE  Sterling Silver Hammered Oval Link Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Unusual and Wonderful  This bracelet caught my eye and never let go. It's such an open, interesting design. It did seem a bit shorter than the 7.5" advertised, but a quick trip to the jeweler solved that. Very high quality--I'll wear it often. <end>  LOVE IT!  I love this bracelet! It looks like it cost a whole lot more than it does!I love bargains! Would recommend it to anyone. I am now looking for necklace to match! <end>
 B00081R4LO  Pink CZ Rings - 0.70 Carat Pink Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  THE PERFECT COLOR PINK  I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON "PINK" RINGS-AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET ONE THAT DOES'T HAVE A NASTY YELLOW GLOW-UNLESS YOU GO TO A PINK DIAMOND(AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT)-WELL I HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL ESTATE PINK BAND WITH A SOFT PINK COLOR(NO YELLOW) AND I SAW THIS-GOT IT-NOW HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WEDDING SET THAT LOOKS LIKE PINK DIAMONDS.I LOVE THIS RING.IF YOU REALLY KNOW PINK RINGS AND WANT A REAL PINK WITHOUT THE YELLOW GLARE=THIS IS IT.JUST GORGEOUS.THANKS FOR SUCH A NICE RING THAT I COULD AFFORD. <end>  Nice ring, stone is a bit darker then the photo  This is a nice ring. The stone is darker in color then what showed on my monitor. The previous reviewer mentioned pink stones that look yellow - this is my first piece with a pink stone and I would say it is a true "pink" that if anything leans towards purple in color. The quality is high and the stone sparkles. <end>
 B00081R4Q4  Jessica Simpson Replica CZ Wedding Band ||	  Does not rate a star  I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of quality on this time. Within less than 3 weeks of wearing the ring, one of the CZ stones already fell out of its setting. Prior to that, I noticed that within the 1st week of wearing the ring, some of the stones were already loose within their settings. <end>  Save your money  Within a week of wearing the ring the biggest stone fell out. Was really disappointed because for the price the ring looked pretty good. <end>  What can you expect?  For $19.49, you get that much quality...basically none. And Jessica is only trying to make more and more money with cheap rings. Save you money until you can buy a more decent ring that looks a lot better. <end>  My 9 yr old has better rings !  Although this ring is very pretty on screen ~ Buyer Beware ! In person it is cheap looking and a couple of the stones are crooked, I have not bothered to send it back ~ not worth the aggravation ~ my 9 yr old uses it to play dress-up (she has better looking dress-up rings in her collection - need I say more !) <end>  Fabulous and Classy look! GREAT Customer Service !  This ring is just gorgeous and looks completely real. I have gotten so many compliments on it! The only catch is that the manufacturer decided to make the newer version of this same ring, with smaller diamonds. I ordered another ring for a friend and received this scaled down diamond version. I sent it back requesting the old (bigger diamond) version like the one I already own...LET ME STRESS THIS, Customer Service is OUTSTANDING. They quickly responded to my request and shipped the older version ring to me with no problems. So if you want the new version, the diamonds are smaller (just as beautiful, just not what I wanted) If the old version is available, I highly recommend it. <end>

 B00084X8TI  The Key To My Heart Pave CZ Pendant ||	  Very Tiny  This is a cute pendant, but it is extremely small, also the length of the necklace was not long enough. <end>  Good buy!  Pretty and sparkly! Quick delivery and a quality product. The little key does not have much sparkle to it, so I gave it 4 stars. <end>  Love this  I really like this necklace! I also get a lot of compliments. My best friend keeps threatening to steal it.  ) It is very pretty. I wear it a lot and I've had it for 6 months. It is still in great shape. <end>  Very pretty  Very pretty necklace and the perfect length, nice that there is a choice on the length as well. <end>  Heart and key  I get a lot of complaments on the heart and key pendent. I have been looking for one for a while, and this one I saw on someone else and then I knew it was the one. <end>
 B00084XF9G  Sterling Silver Ring with Pink Cubic Zirconia ||	  Gorgeous ring, stone fell out after a few days  Really loved the ring, but the stone was not secured in place and fell out after a few days. I have still not gotten around to having it repaired. Disappointed because I loved the design, but be warned that your stone may fall out too. I was just lucky to save the stone. <end>
 B00084ZIXW  Solitaire Cubic Zirconia Engagement Ring ||	  Disappointed - Not as advertised.  I ordered this ring with three expectations - one, that it would fit, two, that the band looked like the photo, and three, that the stone would be a half-carat size as advertised. While I did get it in record time - it was even delivered in two days ON Christmas Day! - I found that it did not fit my expectations on any count.First - I ordered the same size 7 I wear every day (and have many rings in this size that DO fit) and it was noticeably too small.Second - the band does not look like this at all. I got a knife-edge band, with a sharp ridge running across the upper edge of the band, which I don't care for at all. It's probably the mounting style I like the least of all.Third - The stone is definitely bigger than a half-carat - probably closer to a full carat. I don't have my calipers handy, but when compared with some half-carat sized stones I already own, it is significantly larger. I wanted the smaller size stone it was supposed to be.The stone also fits so far down inside the mounting that the culet (bottom point of the stone) hits the bottom of the prong set mount, and that blocks light from coming up through the bottom, cutting way down on the sparkle.Unfortunately, it's going back for a refund. <end>
 B000851J2K  Sterling Silver Continuous Hoop Earrings - 2.5 Inch ||	  They come apart  (  I simply wanted a pair of medium sized silver earrings. I was tired of purchasing the cheap ones from the kiosks or pharmacies which would lose their shape after a few wears. Once I received these I was even happier as the post slides into the hoop so you don't have to deal with clasps which won't catch or if they do catch, pinch your ear for that split second. Unfortunately, I believe the cheap ones would have been preferable. Note  These are VERY THIN hoops; the posts which slide into the hoop? great concept unfortunately, mine keep sliding back out. So every time I wear these hoops, by mid-day I have to search my office for a silver hoop(s) as the post has become undone on one or both. Not impressed. On the up-side though, it appears to be a very good silver. <end>
 B000853L4E  White Freshwater Pearl Three Strand Earrings ||	  Beautiful and Worth it  I bought these earring to match a 3 strand freshwater necklace that my grandmother let me borrow for my wedding. They complemented the necklace well and added that finishing touch that I needed to be a beautiful bride. They provided a pouch for the set for storage, they came quickly in the mail, in a matter of a few days. I had no complaints about this transaction. <end>
 B0008EORB6  925 Sterling Silver 2mm Clear Cubic Zirconia 22mm Round Eternity Pendant with 1mm Rolo Chain Necklace ||	  Beautiful!  I love this necklace. It is very pretty, and I love that you can buy the length of chain you need--very smart selling point! <end>  Damaged Merchandise  I received this pendant today and a stone was missing. This was my first purchase with Gem Avenue. I cannot believe that I waited about 10 days to get the package and it came damaged. I guess they have a poor quality control department. It was quite obvious that the stone was missing. Maybe someone there is blind as a bat! <end>  This is the one I was looking for  I've looked at a lot of eternity pendant necklaces but this is the first one I've found on a snake chain. Very pretty. Very nice. Good quality <end>  Gem avenue  It was smaller than I had expected, but it is a necklace that I will definitely wear in the future. <end>
 B0008GLU7S  Sterling Silver Italian Heart Thread Earrings total length 4 1/4" Long ||	  Hi ~  They are beautiful and plan to order some more threaders my favorite type of earrings!! <end>  Unwearable  These earrings are pretty but the weight of the heart is more than the weight of the chain, so they will not stay in the ear. Normally threaders have a stabilizer in the middle of the chain to help it sit right, these do not and they slip right out within a minute. I am sending them back. <end>  Love it  I have been wearing this earring since I have recieved it. It came in a timingly matter after being ordered and I have had no problems with it. <end>
 B0008IUE0A  Nickel Free Tarnish Free Rodium Plated Sterling Silver Hearts Shaped Clear Cubic Zirconia Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Cute  Cute design and affordable! The band scratches easily though. And there are tiny little gaps where the stones are set. But very affordable and cute! I love the design! <end>  **Seems Like A Nice Ring**  I haven't worn it a lot yet but it looks really pretty. Nice band (not too big, nor is it super petite). The stones all seem well placed. It's true to size. I'm happy with it. <end>  cute and affordable  the product came sooner than expected. unlike what the previous reviewer said, i don't see any tiny gaps anywhere, which is always a good thing.unfortunately, it doesn't come in half sizes, but that's something i can live without. <end>  Too cute!  Bought it for my niece, wife is keeping it. Enough said. Nice ring! Gem Avenue, I think we'll be seeing you again very soon! <end>  Perfect and simple  Great simple ring with stones that are secure. I seldom take my jewelry off so this fact was important and the ring has been all I hoped. <end>  Pretty Ring!  This is a lovely ring. It is well made and I love the design. I've had mine for a month now and I've had no loose stones or problems with the band. It's very nice!! <end>  Simple, but cute.  This ring runs small. I ordered it in a size 5 and when I got it it was way too small for the finger I wanted to wear it on. I had to send it back for the next size up and it took FOREVER to get back to me, but when it finally did, it was the next size up and it fits perfectly and I like the size, no gaps between the hearts and lining, the little hearts are very sparkly, and I wear it everyday all day! ...just order the next size up than what you'd normally get! =) <end>  Heart Ring  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she loved it!! The ring is beautiful, perfect for a teenager. She fell in love with it and wears it almost everyday. I have not had one problem with the ring. No gaps, no scratches... it also does good in water... no tarnishing of any sort. Glad I invested in this product. The company was great in shipping this to me before Christmas, I got it in a couple days. <end>  Sweet and sparkly  This ring is very dainty. The cz's are very sparkly. I wish it was bigger in width, but it makes a pretty ring for a small handed person, or as a pinkie ring. <end>
 B0008IUJVY  By Navajo Artist Virginia Long  7/16"x 1/2" Inch Sterling-silver Navajo Bear Paw and Turquoise Post-earrings. ||	  Beautiful  These earrings are spectacularly made and polished brilliantly. My only problem is that they are HUGE! This absolutely doesn't mean that I don't like them...but I was wanting a cute pair of turquoise earrings to wear every day and these are just a bit gaudy for me. I will wear them every now and then, but definitely not as often as I wanted to. Very disappointed at the size, but the craftsmanship is absolutely stunning! <end>
 B0008JEHMU  Sterling Silver 3-Color Eternity Motion Spin Ring size 8(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Stone Fell Out  The ring looks nice - the spinning action is kinda fun - but the stone fell out within the 1st week - and looked like other stones were shortly to fall out as well...i was surprised because i have never had a problem with Silver Insanity's quality of goods before - but they responded quickly to my claim and offered either refund or exchange. Although, I AM upset that I have to pay to ship it back. This is a defective item and they should've offered to pay the shipping. <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring is so pretty. It spins easily, and the crystals sparkle as it spins. I really love it! <end>  Beautiful.  I bought this ring because none of my other rings seemed to fit properly, and the colors looked nice. I recieved it two days after it said it was shipped, which was convenient. It came in a cute velvet, drawstring bag and I must say, the colors are much more brilliant then portrayed in the picture. The band is a little thin, but that's not bad because it doesn't get in the way. All in all, I think this was a great buy. I love this ring, and the spinning motion is really fun too. ] <end>  Fantastic inexpensive "fiddle" ring!  I bought this ring after reading that spinner rings had helped others finally stop biting their nails. I've always heard that one habit would have to be replaced by another; a likely key to past failed attempts.This ring has surpassed my expectations. I leave it on day and night including showers and hand washing. It still looks great and hasn't tarnished a bit. I just ordered additional ones for a friend and for my daughter. <end>
 B0008RRFAI  Very Tiny Square Blue Lapis Stone Stud Earrings 1/8 inch ||	  Small and nice, but post is thick.  These earrings are just the right size I was looking for. However, the post was a little too thick for my newly pierced ears. <end>  Square earrings  These earrings are between fair and good quality, decent if you just want to find a nice flat stud earring to wear semi-permanently. The look is good, with a small amount of abnormal design flaws (not exactly square, a bit crooked) but for this price the build quality/reliability to price ratio is good. The minor flaws can only be seen upon close inspection and they are good earrings for all intensive purposes. Been wearing mine for about 3 months now with no problems.Hope it helps... <end>
 B000931EVC  Sterling-silver Yellow-gold Black Hills Gold Half Hoop dangle-earrings ||	  Black Hills Gold  This is my first piece of Black Hills Gold and I love it. I'll be adding more to my collection. The shipment was packaged well and came quickly. Definitely would recommend <end>
 B00093FZ26  14k Yellow Gold 5.5-6.0mm Pink Freshwater Cultured Pearl Stud Earrings ||	  Nice quality and look great!  We got these earrings for our daughter on her 6th birthday. She loves jewelry and especially earrings. The color is a little pale, the actual earrings aren't quite as pink as they look in the picture. But they are good quality and look great. My daughter wears them all the time.This was a good buy. These earrings are great for anyday wearing or with evening wear. They look very stylish. <end>  Not nearly as pink as pictured.  They have a pink hue but don't show a big difference from my white pearl earrings. Didn't bother returning. <end>  Pretty  Though the color of the pearls wasn't as pink as they looked online, the actual earrings are great. I wear them with jeans or a nice dress. They are easy to dress up and add a little something to a casual outfit. Bought two pairs and am having a hard time figuring out who gets the other pair; all my friends will love them. <end>  Overall, Very nice quality  I fretted about ordering these after reading some of the reviews. I am delighted with the quality. The color, as reported by many, is not as pink as the picture indicates. However, when you put them next to a pair of yellow or white pearls, they are obviously pink hued. I think it depends on your skin color, but on me the pink pearls do look nicer.For $21, it was a great bargain for an everyday set of earrings. <end>  Excellent Value  I purchased these earrings for my eight-year-old daughter. She loves them and I found them to be an excellent value. <end>  Barely pink, but pretty anyway  Unfortunately, I agree with the other reviewers who have said these pearls are not nearly as pink as the picture makes them seem. They're more of a grayish pink - think storm clouds at sunset. On the plus side, they have a beautiful lustre. Another reviewer stated that she bought these earrings as a gift for her little girl. Though the pearls are small, they could be worn by an adult. In sum, they are lovely earrings as long as you don't expect them to be truly pink. I paid $13.19 on sale for mine and will keep them and wear them. <end>  Review---14k Yellow Gold 5.5-6.0mm Pink Freshwater Cultured Pearl Stud Earrings  Wife liked them so much she asked me to buy her a set of black ones. She was also happy that they had 14k gold posts. She loved the quality. <end>
 B00093FZ4E  Sterling Silver Oxidized Bangle Bracelet By Zina ||	  Gorgeous  This is a gorgeous bracelet. Looks great paired with other bangles of varying design. The wraparound wire design makes it sturdy; it doesn't warp out of shape when you take it on and off. I highly recommend this bracelet especially if you like to mix and match several different bracelets together. Would look great by itself too. <end>
 B00093OO8W  Sterling Silver Vibrant Green Jade 7" Link Bracelet ||	  Pretty Bracelet - Poor workmanship  This is such a pretty bracelet - unfortunately, the hinges are weak and break. I have one in both the green and purple jade - happened to both of them. <end>
 B00097DBXC  Collar Necklace w/Violet Beads ||	  beautiful to look at and what a bargain  I ordered three necklaces (one had a broken clasp). This is my favorite of the three. I can wear it with lots of different outfits. <end>  Cheap, ugly, and uncomfortable.  The beads are cheap and poorly made, the chain is the color of rust, and the necklace is uncomfortable to wear. I didn't pay enough for it to make it worth returning, so I just tossed it in the trash. <end>
 B00097E79Y  Ravello Foldable Leather Valet (Orig $59) - #51974 ||	  neat valet  just the thing for the night table or desk. opens flat and easy to pack. my change and keys etc, no longer spills all over the table. <end>
 B00099EARG  Hello Kitty Pink Enamel Bow and Sterling Silver Ring, Size 7 ||	  I love it!  I purchased the ring for myself and I absolutely love it. It is a lil bigger than I thought but its hello kitty I can't complain ) <end>
 B00099YXJ6  Not Your Grandmother's Pearls ||	  the best customer service  Love the necklace it's exactly like the photo. I asked for it to be 2-inches longer and for a small fee the necklace was made longer. Very fast and efficient transaction. Excellent craftsmanship. I would definitely buy from them again. <end>
 B0009A6KFA  Your Diamond Ring ||	  Extremely Happy Fiancee  My girlfriend was to say in the least very happy and excited to get the ring. Quite a few people were skeptical that I bought my ring from Amazon, but after a jeweler's appraisal all skepticism was satisfied. Jeweler appraised about 40% higher than what I paid. <end>  Makes it so very, very easy.  Dealing with jewlery salespeople is like dealing with car dealers.... misearble. Using Amazon to buy the engagement ring was the best decision I could have made. Such an easy process, such a great price, and the customer service was superb. There was a slight delay in delivery (one day) and I had an email letting me know to expect the delay, and a refund of $70 for the inconvience. The ring showed up looking exactly like I thought it would, my fiance loved it, as has everyone she has shown. I would recommend getting your ring on Amazon to anyone I know. <end>  selling rings it's not the same as selling DVD  I whish Amazon would pay more attention to details, when a customer pays $6K for a product. Remember that when I go to buy a ring in a store, the level of service is quite different compare to Blockbuster. You offer far more info on DVDs, then on a ring. I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring to be sent before the actual shipment in very high resolution.The bad and very bad 1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...5. Engraving on the ring says "Amazon" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this. Not just return policy.7. Back to pictures. Usually, when you buy the stone in a store, you have an opportunity to look at the diamond with 10x magnification. So, I expect the picture like this when I select the diamond.The good 1. Having the scan of the diamond certificate is great.2. Automated diamond search system is very good.3. Looks like the craftsmanship is good. <end>  Good choice!  I buyed a diamond, but the certified does not match whith my selection. even when the certified of Amazon is correct, the certified of GIA doesn't match. I leave this as well, because the issue that does not match (cut), don't have relevance in the price. I buyed an "Ideal Cut" and I recieved a "Very Good Cut".The ring, (18k gold), is excelent! <end>  A terrific experience - bravo Amazon!  I was initially skeptical about buying an engagement ring from Amazon. However, the ease of selecting exactly what I wanted and the terrific price convinced me to give it a shot.The ring shipped overnight, insured, via UPS, which allayed a lot of my fears. The package also contained a detailed appraisal (useful for insurance), and an explanation of the cut, clarity, etc. with a visual depiction of where the flaws are (although I can't see them anyway!). Amazon was also excellent about communicating throughout the process - I received emails confirming the order, updating me on the status of the setting and quality of the diamond, and letting me know when to expect delivery. There is a 90 day return policy - in case you're not happy with the ring, or if (god forbid) you are unsuccessful in your proposal.The ring itself was beautiful and showed quality craftsmanship. My fiance was impressed that I "designed" such a beautiful ring, and that I could afford such a large center stone. I would highly recommend this service to anyone who wants a customized ring and also wants to save money. The only drawback is that I have to pay for cleanings (they are sometimes included when you buy from a jewelry store). <end>  I won't buy diamods anywhere else  I bought this item back in 2007 and shipped it over to Costa Rica (where we live). I made an extensive research about what to look for in an engagement ring, particularly diamonds. None jewelry stores I visited offered certificates and you would just have to believe what the jewelers told you about the rings they offered. I often found out that the quality of the diamonds sold was sub-par (I-J color, and SI1-2 clarity) and over priced.I cannot stress the security that you get when your diamond comes with a certificate (GIA in our case). I received the ring and was very impressed by it. It packed quite a lot of fire and the platinum ring was beautifully finished. We have even received complements from local jewelers about the craftsmanship of the ring.I was worried at first about the diamond coming off the setting (trellis) but my wife has had it now for over two years and wears it everyday to work without problem. It gets scratched and loses some brilliance, but every year we take it for cleaning and polishing at our local jeweler and it recovers all of the spark, just like the day we bought it.The only downside of buying rings online is the sizing, but I find that the Amazon sizing chart is quite accurate and as long as you get a ring from your girlfriend to use as a sample and maybe order the ring 1/4 size larger, you can't miss (in any case it's cheaper to get a ring reduced than enlarged).I hope this review gives you some confidence in buying your engagement ring through amazon. We were so happy with our purchase that we bought our wedding rings through Amazon as well and are quite happy with both purchases. <end>  pretty nice  The diamond is great and exactly what I chose. Maybe I'm being picky, but one side of the ring is slightly wider than the other and its stamped amazon. I'm having a hard time deciding if I should return or just be happy with it. It is probably unnoticeable, but I did. I guess when I spend so much I want it to be perfect. <end>  Another way to make that special someone feel even more special.  The option to custom order a ring is the only way to go. Do a little research on what the different factors mean (diamond clarity, etc.) and you can set your bounds on a ring that matches your specifications and budget. I purchased the ring for my wife (2nd marriage). We've been married for 6 years and both wear plain wedding bands ($15 specials). I had waited far too long to get her something nice and she was absolutely surprised and thrilled when I gave her the box to open. I wouldn't hesitate to use the service for my wife's next surprise. <end>  Beautiful ring  This ring was perfect and not to extravagant. Not too simple but just right. My fiance loves it. Could not find anything this simple and still awesome in stores. Fiance is happy and I am happy too! <end>  The price/quality combo is unparalleled!  I bought this engagement ring for my girlfriend ... after receiving the ring, it was obvious that there was no way she could say no. We ended up with just under a carat with a hefty 18K gold band for under $1500. It looks, feels, and is excellent. I would recommend Amazon's build an engagement ring service to anyone. <end>  Promised Shipping  I received this diamond ring within one week after ordering. I appreciate with the service of Amazon and the quality of the product...the only thing I am not so satisfied would be the cleanness of the certificate; it's a bit old to me. <end>  Beautiful Diamond Ring  It's exactly as I imagined... only more beautiful. The diamond is spectacular, the package is very nice. It's a small, simple, but very nice ring for those of us who are somehow short on budget. There is no way that you are going to receive a NO as an answer with this ring! <end>  Excellent experiance.  Took my time using Amazon online tools, and upon the suprizingly rapid delivery, found the ring to be even better than I'd imagined. Extreemly pleased. <end>  My diamond ring experience  When I received my ring, it was very apparent that it was made incorrectly. There was a huge gap between the diamond and the setting but only on one side. I contacted customer service to see if this could be repaired and was told that since it was a purchase over $300.00, I could only get a refund. I advised them I would be overnighting the ring back and would wait for my refund. After 7 days of waiting for my money, I received a "repaired ring" which ended up looking just as bad as the first one. It was the original ring that someone had poorly attempted to close the gap on the band. Not only was there still a gap, but now one side of the ring sat higher than the other. I immediately called customer service because I did not ask for another ring to be sent and explained that I had been waiting for a refund. The rep that I spoke to said he didn't see any documentation of a new ring being shipped or the old one being repaired. He told me that he would call me first thing the next morning after speaking to some of his colleagues to get this resolved. I waited 2 days and still had not heard anything so I called again. I spoke to a different rep who assured me I would have my refund the next day. I told her that I had already been waiting almost two weeks for this refund. She said she would put a rush on it but that never happened. I never did hear back from the 2 reps that I spoke with as they both promised to call me with an update. After waiting over 3 weeks I finally received my refund. My experience with Amazon was horrible. Not only was the product poorly constructed but the customer service department was no help at all. They made several promises that they did not keep and never made an attempt to keep me informed with the status of my issue. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!! Thank you for taking the time to read this...M. Ebel <end>
 B0009B6IW4  Sterling Silver O Stud Earrings with Pave Cubic Zirconias ||	  Not what was expected  These earrings were not at all what I expected. Very little sparkle. And the picture seems to depict a darker color which is what I wanted. They are definitely silverish in color. Expected much more sparkle. Kinda cheap looking too. <end>
 B0009BA28A  Sterling Silver Daisy Stud Earrings ||	  Very nice earrings  These daisy earrings are very well made and so pretty. They are substantial without being too big, and they look great with my dark hair. Now I want the rest of the Daisy set. <end>
 B0009BAJB0  Sterling Silver Infinity Ring ||	  Wonderful Piece of Jewelry  I must admit.. I was a little concerned the ring wouldnt look as nice as the picture when I ordered it.. but the price was so great I couldnt pass up trying it. It is a wonderful piece. I was totally thrilled when I saw it.. couldnt help thinking how much my daughter is going to love this at christmas. Infinity jewelry was the only thing she asked me to find for her and I know she is going to love this. I bought a sterling silver necklace at Target & wasnt totally thrilled with it when I bought it, but it was the only infinity item I could find in a store. This is a piece I know she will be totally happy with and so will you! Dont hesitate to buy it.. you will love it, especially when the price is so little and the ring is so pretty! <end>

 B0009DJZFO  CZ WEDDING RINGS - Princess Cut Cubic Zirconia Engagement Ring & Wedding Band ||	  Poor quality product  My partner bought this ring for me for our 7th anniversary. I LOVED the design of this ring, and loved wearing it because it received so many compliments!HOWEVER, it started to tarnish very quickly and after nine months, the stone had started to loosen. Last week, somewhere between home and work, the prongs bent and the stone fell out. I was very careful not to wear this ring in water, when using household chemicals, or when doing anything that might have caused damage to the ring (like gardening or moving furniture). While I recognize that this isn't exactly the Hope Diamond, I wish that the ring would have lasted longer than (almost) one year.My partner ordered a new ring for me from another company, and made sure that this time the ring was made of sterling silver NOT brass. We shall see. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful!  I just got this ring out of the envelope and it is absolutely stunning!!! My husband got it for me for our 7th anniversary and I couldn't be more happy. It is the perfect size diamond and it sparkles incredibly. My 4 year old says it is "Beautiful and shiny." She is so right!! <end>  Wedding Ring Set  I like both rings, but they did get scratched pretty fast. Not really a big deal though. I still wear them. <end>  Fabulous!  I purchased this set for my birthday/Christmas present/stay-at-home mom who deserves a little something. It's beautiful! I can't stop looking at my hand. I wore it while browsing around a jewelry counter. The saleswoman saw it and exclaimed, "Yow-za. That's beautiful!" Far be it from me to tell her it was CZ. FYI, my wedding ring is a size 5, so I ordered the same size, but this one fits snugly. Quick delivery from the company. <end>  Pretty eye catching ring  I ordered this ring set as an alternative to my gold wedding set. It is a pretty ring and has nice sparkle. I've received a few complimetns from friends and relatives, but apparently I am allergic to it. I called the seller, explained that my finger had turneed very green, and they referred me to their site. Under policies it explains that you could put a clear coat of nail polish on the inside of the ring. This will act as a barrier between the ring and your finger, thus leaving me/you w/o the embarassing green ring finger. Did I know this about jewelry before hand, yes, but this particular jewelry msuty contain quite a bit of nickel aloy - I have never seen a reaction on my finger this strong. But, this is situational and I am speakign from my experience.However, It's a great inexpensive alternative to real diamonds and platinum. The seller was great on the phone, the ring arrived in perfect condition and in a very timely manner. overall it's a good deal for those of you looking at this item. <end>  You can find better deals  Find it somewhere else,they have real silver rings by other merchants.Discoloration was visible no more than 2 mos into purchase.IMHO go with something else and keep searching sorry to be so down to the point but find something else and pay the extra $10-15. <end>  Super frustrated  My item was supposed to arrive 2/8 and was shipped on 2/10. Where is my item it's been in Illinois since 2/10 this is getting extremely frustrating. <end>  Wedding ring  I like the ring. I got it really quick, and it was very affordable. The size was perfect, so I didn't have to have it fitted. No complaints. <end>  very nice  looks great. I have been wearing them separate because the large diamond gets in the way of my work. It has'nt turned my finger green and still looks good after a month and a half. <end>  my fingers green  when i searched this ring i was searching for sterling silver... i didnt read where it said it was brass until i got on here today. the ring is pretty but i wanted to wear this to the pool and on vacation afraid i would loose my real diamond. cant really do that with this ring since it turns you green after a couple days. <end>  A compliment getter!  Very nice quality ring, I've received a lot of compliments! Very fast delivery service. Thank you! <end>  wedding ring  It's a wonderful ring. The quality is wonderful. It was everything the site said it would be. I am very impressed. <end>  not very impressed  Well, it arrived two and a half weeks after it was supposed to. There is no way you can wear both rings at the same time without them looking ridiculously huge and awkward!! You can tell they are not real, also after paying shipping and handling online, I had to pay another $15 for shipping when the rings arrived. I recommend looking around a little more, perhaps with a different dealer. <end>

 B0009E1IVC  Sterling Silver Starfish Bracelet ||	  Small but cute  The bracelet was nice and worth the price. However, it is a bit small. Luckily, the friend who I purchased it for is quite petite. Had I bought it for myself I would have had to return it. I'm 5'8 and weigh 135 lbs so if you are my size you may consider not buying. <end>

First I paid $26 for them, then when they are shipped to me with a brochure, the same set of earrings are $16, would have been nice to only pay that for them since I get an ear infection because the sterling silver is not the grade they claim it to be. So in other words, I now have a pair of earring I overpaid for and can't wear. <end>  Cute Earrings but...  These are really cute earrings, they claim to be made with 925 sterling silver material (usually 925 sterling silver doesn't cause irritations to my skin). However, I am allergic to the earrings metal, I get infection on both earlobs after one day of wearing. It is a shame I really like the look of these. =( <end>  Great earrings  They look even better in person than in the image. The workmanship is beautiful - in fact, several people mistook them for the Tiffany's version - I did not care to set them straight! ;) <end>  Very cute  I haven't worn these yet as I'm waiting for the summer but these are super cute and exactly as pictured. I can't wait to wear them! <end>  Sensational Starfish  They are beautiful and of excellent quality. My niece has the Tiffany Starfish necklace and these earings will match it perfectly. I can't want to see her reaction when she opens the box Christmas morning! Thank you for having these available through Amazon.com. <end>  Very cute!  I think these earrings are very cute. Look great with the matching necklace! Would highly recommend, good quality. <end>  Beautiful product, fantastic customer service  I ordered both the starfish neckalce and earrings from Eve's addiction. As far as the purchase, the earrings were absolutely gorgeous, very shiny and well made. The starfish pendant was very pretty as well, although I changed the chain.I wanted to make a comment on how amazing the customer service is. When I was browsing the website 1 week later, I noticed that the set had dropped by $10 as it was onsale then. I called the customer service, immediately got in touch with a friendly representative who easily credited my credit card with the price difference, thus making it even a better deal! I will definitely be shopping with Eve's addiction in the future. <end>  nice starfish studs  Good Quality silver stud earrings. Bought the pendant for my sister. She enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying her the earrings to match (bought myself a pair too!). Eve's Addiction (the seller) were really great in correcting the order when a mistake was made. Would buy from them again. <end>  Really flattering!  I purchased these for myself and they are great. They have tarnished a bit but overall the quality is good especially for the price. I get compliments all the time on them. <end>  Larger than expected but nice quality  These were a bit larger than I was expecting - I looked at the measurements but it's hard to picture until you see the earrings. However, they seem to be very high quality and very shiny. Arrived quickly from seller in a nice little jewelry pouch. Can't verify if they're 925 sterling or not but I don't have any allergies so shouldn't be a problem. Just wish they were a little bit smaller but I'm sure I'll get used to them! Great earrings. <end>  Love these earings!  I am in love with these earings and wear them almost everyday. They are beautiful yet simple and do not get in the way. <end>
 B0009EI7Y8  Faberge Style EGG ||	  Looks fantastic, but not so tasty  While the wrapper is artfully done, I was disappointed with the filling. I don't know if the one I got was a factory defect or not, but once I had removed the elaborate wrapper, I found it was empty, without even the smell of chocolate. After this, I'll stick with Cadbury eggs, but my experience may not be representative of the normal presentation. I've given the product 4 stars because of the wrapper, though, while difficult to tear off, it was certainly stunning. <end>  Not all it's cracked up to be  I was very disappointed to find that this chocolate egg was past it's sell by date. It has a slimy texture reminiscent of cheap christmas tree decorations. If you appreciate your chocolate, go for the full-price item as you'll really notice the difference. <end>  Very Happy with the Free shipping part of it  Having been an admirer of Faberge eggs for quite some time, this price was something I could'nt turn down, I never pay full price for anything and knew if I just waited I would be able to get a $2.5 Million dollar piece for under $200 eventually.Only thing that soured the deal was it did'nt qualify for free shipping...hence the 4 stars !!! <end>  misleading price!  The discount seems to be a little off - 100% of 2.5 million dollars is 2.5 million, meaning this product should be free, but instead they are only taking 99.994% of the list price. This is a disappointment. As a result, these items should be shipped free to all Amazon customers. <end>  Eggy... ewww  I think it was poor marketing on Faberge's part. Who wants to smell like eggs? I prefer Brut. <end>  Great deal, and an extra surprise inside!  It's amazing that amazon would take a price cut of $2,499,850 on this product just so we customers could have a cheaper price. Upon receving mine in the mail, I opened it up and found an extra surprise...a slimy chick! <end>  This is FAKE Faberge, read their description!  Read the product desription closely, folks--it is a Faberge STYLE egg, NOT a Faberge egg. Hence the 99.9945% discount. <end>  Its 250$ not 2.5mil  obviously there was a typo here. look at their other products - all between 250$ and 400$. <end>
 B0009EJJTU  Faberge Style Frog Pendant ||	  Beautiful pendant  I collect Faberge style eggs and these are as nice as any that I have bought in a store. Great customer service and fast delivery! <end>
 B0009EKA52  Pugster Emerald Cz Sterling Silver Ring Gift Fashion Jewelry ||	  Looks like diamonds  Following a burglery I was left with no jewelery, and this ring dresses my hand beautifully. This is fun costume jewelery, which does not look vulgar. The cubic zirconia stones look great. <end>
 B0009EMJD8  Pugster Year Dragon Bith Date Italian Charm ||	  Italian Charm  I really liked the idea of this one, but it ends up being so small, you really can't see what it is. Anyone that sees my charm bracelet always has to ask me what it is. <end>
 B0009EYJM2  Men's Titanium Bracelet w/ Steel Clasp, 8" ||	  Great Bracelet, But Not For Everyday Wear  After reading the reviews of this bracelet, I decided to give it a whirl. The one downside to this and other bracelets in this price range and styling is that the metal seems to be a bit soft. This will lead to some nicks and scratches on the bracelet if worn every day.The bracelet itself is very attractive and I've had a couple of people take notice of it. Definitely recommend! <end>  Great gift!  I gave this bracelet as a gift for my father and he loved it!It's a one-size-fits-all bracelet perfect for anyone, and by being titanium it's so light you won't even notice you are wearing it.I am going to get one for myself now. <end>  Very nice!!  This is a great bracelet for men. I got this for my husband. He has been wanting one for a while but all the other titanium bracelets were about $300 or more. This is a great price and looks great. <end>  very nice!! stylish and elegant  i always wanted a titanium braclet.and i found this on of all places amazon.com..i thought why not? i was very surprised when i got it this bracelet looks better in person! very high quality...the pic dont do it justice its a elegant design very contemporary and classy..it does not look gawdy or"bling bling "tacky..... treat yourself and pick this one up! <end>  Great Bracelet!  This bracelet looks better than the picture. It looks beautiful on my wrist. The fifty bucks that I paid for it was a real bargain. I love it. There's only one drawback, it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it ten stars. I'll pay to make it smaller. It's made of titanium, and maybe it's too tough to alter. I want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. If I can get it altered, I'll wear it until the day I die, which I hope will be 100 years from now. <end>  Very Modern & Attractive Bracelet  As a gift, this bracelet will not disappoint. It appears just (or better) as it does in the picture. The only downside is that, for a gentlemen with a thicker bone structure, there will not be any give, nor do they provide extra links to make it a bit more comfortable. Otherwise, one cannot go wrong with selecting it. <end>  My quest has ended....  I have been looking for a bracelet for what seems to be years. Never found the right style/size/design combination to fit until now. This bracelet looks great on the wrist. It is well constructed and very comfortable to wear with no pinching; I'm giving it the full 5 stars without any hesitation. <end>  It's a worth buy  I got this bracelet for my boyfriend. Initially, I was looking at two different designs, but I'm really interested with this one. I made up my mind to buy this bracelet. When I received it, I'm vary satisfied with it. It's really nice, and the good thing is my boyfriend really like it. It's a worth buy. <end>  Excellent Gift  I got this for my friend for christmas, and he totally loved it. Everyone that sees it thinks that it cost' over $100. It looks that good, and it looks great on him. <end>  Great addition to my titanium collection  I have purchased a few titanium bracelets in the past and this one is a great addition. Very comfortable, almost like you aren't wearing anything.I particularly like the blend of satin and smooth finishes on the item. It is just a bit fancy and I like that because I generally like things that are just a bit different, but not too much. <end>  Titanium Bracelet  I got the bracelet as a gift for my husband. He is very pleased with the bracelet. <end>  Men's Titanium bracelet  I purchased this product for my husband for Father's Day. He has not taken it off since he received it. My husband is very active and loves how light weight the braclet is while being very stylish. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a good looking, high quality gift. <end>  I liked it  Wearing it from the day i brought it. Over 2 months now. Very happy with this one. Very light, almost like plastic. Looks very stylish! I like it. <end>
 B0009F79F0  H2Ocean oral piercing mouthwash aftercare ||	  Wonderful product!!  I bought this item after I pierced my lip and those who know about piercing the lip it takes a little longer to heal than an non oral piercing, well when i used this stuff it healed a whole lot faster cutting the healing time in half. I used it after i drank, smoked, and ate and my piercing healed in less than 2 weeks. This stuff is great too cause those who know about washing with just sea salt knows the taste is horrible well this stuff has a little minty flavor so your mouth feels clean and refreshed right after you use it. And I also noticed at the beginning of my piercing when it was a little sore about the first 3 days after, that once I used this it helped relived the friction between the sliding of the lip stud back and forth out of the hole it made it slide a lot easier causing a lot less pain, like an ooh ahh feeling after I used it. This stuff is a must buy after an oral piercing. <end>  Amazing Healing  I heard about this stuff on [...] and ordered it right before I got my tongue pierced. I wasn't sure if it was going to get there on time, but sure enough, (I love amazon) It came early! It is the PERFECT size to carry around in my purse, but large enough that it has now lasted me over a week with rinsing my mouth 4-5x's a day! It is in a squirt bottle so you never have to touch your mouth preventing contamination, the formula is AMAZING for healing (it cut the time in half, prevented infection, and soothed it!) and the taste, though awkward at first because it IS a salt water mix, was refreshing and soothing. I always felt like my mouth was clean and tasted/smelled good! I HIGHLY highly recommend it for all new pierced people. If I knew about this I would have bought the spray for my navel ring. My piercer was very impressed at how well I've healed. Stop reading, BUY IT! <end>  Great Oral Mouthwash For Piercings  This works awesome if you've just gotten a new piercing. On this stuff, my mouth was almost never sore and I heal up in about a week and a half (I had a tongue piercing). Although, I'd only recommend this product if absolutely nothing else worked for you. It's a little bit on the expensive side for just a mouthwash. And the tiny bottle only lasted me a week. Just enough time for me to heal up and not really need it anymore. Other than that I recommend this product over all. <end>  Happy Find  I have never heard of this product until I came across it on Amazon. What a happy find.I know it says for oral piercing aftercare, but I've been using it for the last couple days on a tough-to-heal Conch piercing (two months old) and my new Monroe piercing. The red is disappearing from around the Conch, and I have barely any swelling or redness with the Monroe. I have no pain from either piercings at all; which I assume means a good and healthy cleanliness.I have read it helps expedite the healing process, but healing is subjective. I don't expect miracles, but from what I did expect from this product, expectations have been met. I ordered an extra bottle to keep on hand and another bottle in the spray version. I assume the spray will be more convenient for the ears, nose, and outer part of the Monroe.The taste is not exactly what I would call, "pleasant," but it is not terrible. A little bitter, salty, sweet, and minty all at the same time. It leaves a refreshing minty after-taste/after-feel behind which is pleasant. This particular one is "Wintergreen," for those curious about the minty flavor part. I don't know if it comes in different "flavors". I have not seen other flavor choices, just different listings for the same product.I also like that the bottle is small enough to fit in a purse; the 8 ounce bottle is about 7 inches tall. I can take it along just about any where I go. <end>  Real Small Bottle  I didn't see the oz size before purchase but I wish they would have made it clear that this is a very little bottle and for the price not worth it in my opinion because it says to use it twice a day or as needed (after meals etc.) and it will be gone in no time. Now I see the same product in "Arctic Blast" flavor for about the same price but twice the size. My 3 stars isn't for the product itself, but rather the lack of product for the price. I guess next time I'll read every word or sentence of the page before hitting the "add to cart" button. <end>  It's..okay?  I got it a few weeks after I got my lip pierced and I didn't like it. It's like mouthwash mixed with tons of salt. I used it about 4 times and just didn't bother anymore. I wouldn't suggest buying. <end>
 B0009F7SD8  Small Southwestern Native American Handcrafted Bear Paw Post Earrings in Turquoise and Sterling Silver, #1285 ||	  All good  As advertised...quickly delivered and they look the same "in person" as they do in the photo.

She was very pleased with it, and it didn't cost me a fortune.

They arrived way ahead of time and are absolutely lovely, the color is not as stark a white as pictured; rather they are a very creamy ivory color. Perfect! <end>  great pearls, awesome customer service  I just gotta say, the customer service on this item was off-the-hook awesome. really helpful, even if it did arrive after Mother's Day (AMAZON's fault!) <end>
 B0009FTH64  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 18 Inch 6-7mm Black Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  No two are alike.  After purchasing this necklace, I learned a few things about natural pearls No two are identical. They are formed inside an oyster as a defense mechanism against an irritant that becomes lodged in the creatures tissues. The oyster does care if it is not perfectly round.There is no such thing as a naturally black pearl. They are dyed to resemble a blackish color. Each pearl has different porosity an thus absorbes different amounts of dye. Therefore the color is not uniform from one pearl to the next.When the jeweler measures each pearl, he/she measures it at the widest point. So, a 7mm pearl may be only 5 mm at it's narrowest diameter.So the necklace I received was not what I was expecting, but the merchant does offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, so I was invited to return it if I was not satisfied. <end>
 B0009G14UK  Pearl choker, 'Purple Romance' 1" W 12" L ||	  Incredible  This necklace is lovely. The perfect gift for a wife or girlfriend. It feels incredible and it looks beautiful.

 B0009G4YHK  Jade and moonstone drop earrings, 'Between Nations' ||	  Gorgeous Earrings  I love jewelry that is unique and eclectic. These jade and moonstone earrings really bring you to a culture which has lasted for thousands of years, which has worked with and respected these gemstones since before the Roman Empire was a twinkle in someone's eye. The earrings are well made and brings complements whereever I wear them. Highly recommended! <end>  Jade and Moonstone drop earrings  I fell in love with these earrings and would love to have them for myself but my daughter asked for longer earrings for Christmas. I gave them to her and she went wild over them. They are well made and just beautiful on. May still get myself some... <end>  beautiful earrings  very well made, even the box is beautiful, purchased as a gift I'm sure she'll love them. I'm very pleased with this purchase & the price was great. <end>
 B0009G4ZG0  Pearl and quartz earrings, 'Exotic Butterfly' 1" W 1" L ||	  Beautiful Earrings  These are beautiful earrings. I bought many of these Novica Collection Butterfly Earrings in different colors and they are all very well hand crafted and gorgeous. <end>
 B0009GEUL0  14K Yellow Gold Oval Genuine Aquamarine Antique Style Ring ||	  it is still pretty  It seemed to look alot more brillant in the photo, the gold is somewhat dullbut it is still pretty <end>
 B0009GGZH2  Sterling Silver Square Hoop Earrings ||	  The post broke  I got these for my wife as she had been looking for a pair of square hoops for a while without luck. She only wore them a few times and the post broke off one of the earrings. <end>  My go to earrings  These earrings are simple, chic, easy to wear (I don't find them to be heavy), and versatile. I find myself putting these hoops on all of the time. I wear them to work, I wear them out to dinner, I wear them to run errands. They are funky enough to make a statement and simple enough to wear every day. <end>  Should be a 2.5 rating, but that isn't an option  The main complaint about these earrings is that they are heavy. I can't keep them in my ears for a long period of time without them hurting. The other problem is they were smaller then I expected, I didn't expect them to be huge but I also didn't expect them to be as small as they were. Other than that, they are a cute pair of earring and different from the standard hoops that we normally see.So, if your used to wearing heavy earrings these might not bother you. However if you tend to wear light earrings or only wear them every once in a while,like I do,I would suggest not getting these. <end>
 B0009GGZKO  Sterling Silver Concave Disk Earrings ||	  too big and heavy for me  They seem like nice earrings, very glossy and modern, but I'm not comfortable wearing them. The circle on these earrings is almost as big as a dime, but much heavier. I thought I was buying something less chunky; my taste is for smaller earrings. I wish Amazon would publish size measurements. <end>  Sterling Silver Concave Disk Earrings  Very pretty and clasp is reliable. Just as pictured. <end>  My current favorite earrings  If I wear silver jewelry, these are the earrings I almost always choose to wear. I love the look of them and the fact that they have locking wires so I can't lose them. <end>
 B0009GGZMW  Sterling Silver Chandelier Pendant, 16" ||	  Love it!  I don't really have anything bad to say about this. I really like the design, and have gotten lots of compliments on it. Very nice! <end>  Granddaughter Loves It  Bought this necklace for my granddaughter, who loves sterling silver jewelry. This piece was perfect for her. Circles are in and with a set of earrings that matched she was a happy camper. <end>
 B0009GGZZY  Sterling Silver Open Flower Pendant, 16" ||	  Like the necklace  It was just a little bit different than it looked in the picture, but overall is a very nice necklace and I hope my niece will love it. It wasn't exactly how I imagined, but I cannot say what about it is different than I expected. <end>
 B0009GH06W  Sterling Silver and Cubic Zirconia Heart Pendant, 18" ||	  Looks great !  I bought it at a discounted price and qas quite happy about the product. It looks great and definitely shimmers on my girl ! <end>

 B0009GH0FI  Sterling Silver "Family" Heart Pendant, 16" ||	  Pretty and inexpensive  It's pretty much what you see, a pretty charm that's inexpensive. It made my wife smile and it may my wallet smile...a win-win situation. <end>  The Family Circle  This necklace really touched my heart because it reminds me of the family circle. It also reminds me of the love that binds the family circle and how we are intertwined with each other and held together with God's love. When I wear it, I get a lot of comments on how nice it is and also the simplicity of the design. <end>  Perfect & Beautiful!  I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday and my grandson gave it to her as a special gift. It is gorgeous! It brought tears to our eyes! The chain is 16", but worked for my grown up daughter, who is small. PERFECT! <end>  BEAUTIFUL!  So shiny and perfect! I bought this for my 6 year old for valentines day! I loved it so much, I couldn't wait and gave it to her early! Love it!!! <end>
 B0009GH0K8  Sterling Silver Pink Cat's Eye Pendant, 16" ||	  smaller than it looks in the pic  The pendant is actually quite small, only 2 cm long. The 16-inch chain is also very thin. Overall the necklace is pretty, and looks very delicate. <end>  Great Gift!  I ordered this item as a birthday gift for a friend. I was pleased with the quality, and thought it looked nice, not cheap. She seemed very happy with it when she received the gift. Good choice overall for the price. <end>
 B0009GH0NA  Sterling Silver Pink Cat's Eye Heart Earrings ||	  Very attractive; wife loved them  Best bang for the buck of almost any jewelry on the site! My wife loves the diamond earrings I got her, but these were so much less expensive, and she likes them so much. She just lost one in the garden, so I'm going to pick up a replacement. With diamonds, you can't just grab a replacement pair without hurting your credit. <end>
 B0009GH0OY  Sterling Silver Pink Cat's Eye Heart Pendant, 16" ||	  Pretty Pretty!  I bought this as a gift for myself. Something feminine to make me feel girly. And I havent taken it off since. It is so dainty and shiny and pretty! I love it. This would make a perfect gift for someone special. In this case the someoen special was me. =) <end>  super pleased  I was very pleaseed with this necklace. it is beautiful! just like the picture. <end>
 B0009GH0W6  Sterling Silver and Peridot Pear-Shaped Pendant, 16" ||	  A Mediocre Purchase  As someone who has purchased thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from Amazon (everything from powertools and televisions to books and DVDs), I thought I would give their Jewelry Store a try. I have always been extremely pleased with all of my purchases, but if this is a sample of their jewelry, I'm less than pleased. Cheap packaging, and a junk chain that arrived in knots and took a half hour to untangle. This pendant looks much better on the computer than it looks when you have it in your hand. I think that jewelry is probably best purchased at a brick and mortar where you can examine it first hand. <end>  Not the Best Quality  When I received the Pendant, it was not what I expected. The quality of the chain and the design of the pendant was not the best. The return policy was not user friendly because it stated that I was not allowed to exchange the product. So in the end, I received a lower quality necklace and pendant. <end>
 B0009GH0YY  Sterling Silver and Amethyst Oval Pendant, 16" ||	  I would have purchased it, but....  If this necklace had an 18" necklace, I would have purchased it. <end>
 B0009HC68S  Sterling Silver Rainbow Moonstone Leaf Cuff Bracelet ||	  Beautiful bracelet!  This is a beautiful bracelet! The stone on my bracelet was the colorful glowing hue that I was hoping for. I have a large wrist and took a chance on ordering. The silver is very malleable, which makes it an easy fit for my wrist. The silverwork around the cabochon stone is very pretty. It will also be nice if the silver oxidizes a little. I'm very happy with my purchase! <end>
 B0009HI1UK  SCER024 Sterling Silver Clear Crystal Threader Ear Wire Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Highly recommended!  Swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892, and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires. These excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and Swarovski crystals, and are quite attractive. If you are looking for some nice, crystal and silver earrings, then these are the ones to get.By the way, they look great when combined with the Heart, Star and Starburst crystal tattoos - which I also highly recommend!(Review of Shimmering Clear Swarovski Crystal 925 Sterling Silver Threader Ear Wire Earrings) <end>  Nice!  I ordered these for my bridesmaids to wear the day of the wedding and they are nice. All the bridesmaids liked them too! <end>  Swarovski Crystal Earrings  Beautiful earrings. Wore them for a wedding and even my husband noted how much simple elegance they brought to the gown. I wore them so that they were threaded through my ear with only the small silver stem behind my ear. Tried them with each earring-end balanced-out on each side of my ear, but it did not look as nice. They did occasionally get caught in my hair when I was dancing, but they never fell out. I was definitely glad I bought them and would recommend them to anyone. <end>  Pretty earrings!!  I love threader earrings, especially swarovski crystal earrings. These are very pretty; however, they are a little longer than most. Also, be sure to wear the backs on them since the crystal is a little weighty, it pulls the earrings down. You don't want to loose them. <end>  very pretty  I got these for my anniverary (bought them for myself with gift card from hubby), I wore them to Candlelight Service on Christmas eve, they looked great in the Church and in the Candlelight. Very Christmasy and elegant... <end>  Lovely  Product shipped was exactly as pictured. Quick shipping. Given as a Christmas gift, and they loved it! <end>  Wonderful! I love them!  I had never had Swarovski crystals until I ordered these threaders. It seems as if the crystal changes colors to match whatever you have on and I now want a whole set, at least! I think I'll be buying much more. <end>  Swarovski Earrings  These earrings are very beautiful. They are a tad too long, which is why I rated them a four instead of a five. Overall I am pleased with them, I will wear them when I have to dress up, very pretty. <end>  Kathy  I have them and love them and buying a pair for all my girlfriends. <end>  Crystal Threader Earrings  Great errings. I got these for my 12 y.o. neice but decided they were too long for her, but loved them for myself, very cute. <end>  Love them!  These earrings are great! I was actually looking for leverbacks with this shape crystal and was able to cut off the crystal and attach it to leverbacks, and love them! <end>  Dazzling!  These earrings shimmer in the evening and sparkle during the day. They are a wonderful addition to my collection of threads!Carol Robbin <end>  Lovely but box chain is a problem  These are lovely, but I find that the box chain is  1) slippery, so it slides around in my ears - and thus the earrings are insecure, & security is the main reason I like threaders - and 2) rather stiff, so that the chain sticks out a bit on either side, looking a bit goofy. Learned my lesson - no box chains on threaders for me. <end>  Threaders  I was happy with my purchase but I am afraid I'm going to lose one of them. The chain is very fine, which I like, but the back chain seems to creep up to my ear and can eventually come out. Wish there was a curve in the center of the chain so this won't happen. The quality is great! <end>  Not as expected  These are most definitely not made of crystal. The bead is plastic and when it hits the light, it turns all sorts of colors, like children's jewelry. Nonetheless, they are a very lovely style, yet I'm rather disappointed in the quality of the "crystal". For only $12.99, they're not too bad. <end>  Gorgeous & Classic  These earrings have far exceeded my expectations. They are stunning, yet not overbearing. The "threader" chain is also an interesting alternative to the usual posts or Frenh wires. I would recommend adding closure pieces, as they do not come with anything to secure them, although this shouldn't be a deal breaker where buying them is concerned. The crystals, give off a wonderful sparkle and definitely catch the eye. I have had more than one compliment on them and will continue to wear them for work and with evening attire. They are versatile enough to be worn for either! I would definitely recommend these to friends and family  they portray an upscale look, WITHOUT the unreasonable price. <end>  Highly recommend  Great product! I would highly recommend it to anyone. Stunning! Made an excellent gift and shimmers in the lightb. Five stars. <end>  earrings  These earrings are both dainty and very eloquent. Thhey would make a great gift and or present to yourself....very happy with the item...the sparkle is so pretty. <end>  Decent  These are pretty decent looking earrings, and overall for the price I am satisfied. The only complaints that I have are how easily they creep down and fall out if you don't check them every so often; I have nearly lost them on a few occasions. They are extremely light weight and you don't even notice them unless you move your head a lot and they swing. Also, the chain is that sort of stiff chain where it won't double back on itself, it more curves around, so when they hang from your earlobe they don't just cascade gently down, they more curve out then down, which isn't as attractive, in my opinion. They feel and appear fairly cheap, especially considering they are Swarovski, but like I said, for the price I am satisfied with the quality of the product. <end>  Pretty Schweet!  I wanted threader earrings for quite some time but couldn't find any simple, everyday choices until I saw these earrings. Besides the gorgeous crystal cubes hanging at the ends, the chains themselves were just as lovely. I thought they might tug or pull on my ear but they are extremely smooth and comfortable; not to mention, they are the perfect length. I'm pretty short (5'2") and didn't want anything that hit my shoulder or looked like awkward dangles. They fit right in the middle of my neck area when threaded at their lowest point which is usually how I wear them. They're fun to wear on a night out or a quaint lunch date. For such a reasonable price and fast shipping, I don't see where you could go wrong. <end>  A nice new addition  I wear this earring a lot since I got it. Received lots of compliments. Elegant and easy to carry. The only thing is somehow they do not stay very well, tend to slide off, so I have to check once a while. Otherwise I would say it is a great pair to have. <end>  Very lovely  I bought them for my sister-in-law for Christmas, and she thought they were beautiful, absolutely lovely! <end>  Beautiful crystal earrings!!!  These are very pretty earrings! I absolutely love these. I may get more for gifts! <end>

It's so sparkly and I get compliments on it all the time. it came in a pretty little box with a bow and the price was great. What a wonderful addition to my jewelry. <end>  It's a nice addition  Love the studs, it adds to it. Overall not as shiny as expected but none-the-less beautiful. <end>  Sooooo Beautiful!!!!!  I Love this ring! It is sooo shiny & sparkly. It is beautiful. I always get compliments on it. And the price is so worth the money. It is soo cheap! I love marcasite stones. I was able to purchase a bracelet from Target with the same stone and marcasite. So now I have a set. You won't regret purchasing this ring. And it comes in a beautiful box with a bow. <end>
 B0009I2ZVU  Sequin Flower Hair Tie / Pin (M11) ~ Orange ||	  cute but fell apart  Bought these for my bridesmaids 3 years ago, a month before my wedding. It didn't even last a month!!! None of them made it to the wedding. The actual flower didn't stay onto the pin. Cute but not really something I would order again! <end>

 B0009IG9KI  Blue Recycled Glass Bead Necklace, Adjustable ||	  Pretty Item - and Recyclable Materials  This is what I had hoped it would be - a sweet little necklace with color and variety in design, very nice to look at, hold and wear. I just started making necklaces myself and happy to find something in recyclable materials that's aesthetic and appealing. It's a great item to collect or give as a gift, and inspiring for what I'm making on my own. I've been back to this reseller again and it looks like they feature different items at different times, possibly all within the $20-30 range. The one I got was delightful to my taste, and matched the photo. <end>
 B0009IYAJK  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Clear Cubic Zirconia Channel Set 3mm Eternity Band Polished Finish Ring Size 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Not diamond like  Most of the stones turned black after a month or so...if you want it to simulate diamonds as I did--this is not it. I bought it as a make-shift wedding ring while pregnant and unable to wear mine, this only worked for a short time. <end>  Woman's SS Eternity Band  The stones turned black after a short period of time. The silver finish remained shiny but was very disappointed in the stones. <end>  Ring.......  I was disappointed in the ring. It looked so nice on the internet that is why I thought I had to have it, I thought it was very elegant and the width of the band was just what I was looking for. But two days after I received it two stones fell out. However I emailed the company right away and they are replacing it for me, I will be mailing it 8-17-07. I only hope that the replacement will last me a longer time that I can enjoy it. I am giving three stars because the Customer Service that I received was very good.Sept 4, 2007. I got my replacement ring in the mail, it was beautiful. However 2 days after I had it two stones feel out of it again. It is not like I was digging in a garden while wearing it. I am very dissapointed with the product. The ring is very beautiful when you first get it, but the way the stones are placed in it make it not even worth buying. <end>  Ring  Its nice but not as high quality as I thought it would be. Packaging was very nice. <end>  So far so good  Arrived early, still sparkly and have all the stones. Received 4 days after the order was placed. Been wearing them(2)24/7 for 5 days so far. Worn in the shower with no issues. Will update if anything changes. <end>  Okay  I bought this ring with the intention of stacking it with a fake engagement ring found also on gem avenue. However, with a solitaire ring, it didn't really look good stacked. The ring is also a little bigger than my other size 10 rings. Anyways, I wear it as a thumb ring and it looks good there. <end>  Eternity band  So far so good, it was only shiney and sparkled at first. Once you start wearing it it dulls, I've been worrying about stones falling out but so far so good. It will probably happen after I push the send button. <end>  Love it!!  I bought this ring with one in pink cubic to wear everyday. With two kids at home I don't wear my wedding or engagement rings because they leave scratches on the kids. I bought these two rings because they are my kids birthstones and I love them! They are comfortable enough to wear on my right hand and I dont even know I have them on. I agree with the reviewer who said that they were a little bit big but I just wear them on the next finger. <end>  Sterling silver eterity band  I am very happy with my purchase......I bought it for a toe ring and I wear it everyday......the stones are very shinny and the fit is very comfortable. <end>  Wrong Ring  I ordered an eternity band for my wedding ring because I thought it was a great deal. However I recieved a totally different ring. I had been given an engagement ring with the double banded wedding ring and the size was not accurate. I am very disappointed. Now, I have to go find a ring before my wedding and there's no time left! <end>
 B0009J5L74  Silver Forest Simulated Pearl Dragonfly Earrings ||	  Pretty but sturdy  These earrings are very pretty. Yes they are well constructed and not at all too delicate. I loved them so much I bought them for myself but gave them to my daughter. She wears them often and loves them too. <end>  Pretty Dragonfly Earrings  These are very pretty fishhook dangle earrings with a slight powder blue on the wings of the brass dragonfly and a very pale green on metal oval drop sandwiched between a gold color metal filigree, with a small pearly drop. These just seem to be iridescent, but they are not. The earrings are very light weight so my lobes are comfy. I discovered this brand, Silver Forestseveral years ago in a mall dept store, but they got a new buyer and didn't carry them again. So I was pleased to find these now on Amazon. They move a little but do not jangle. My earlobes have aged, so I can't wear stylish heavy earrings. I recommend them for that problem. They are not boring but the design is subtle. The only negative comment I have is that the earwires are just cut and not sanded on the insertion ends, so there is a sharp metal scurf on the end which irritated my earholes. I used a manicure emery board to smooth them and that worked. This may be a problem of manufacturing, but it would be I guess the artisan touch that might cost a lot more than these little beauties. <end>  Another great set, another happy buyer!  As with all Silver Forest jewelry these arrived exactly as pictured -- great quality! Loving everything about these!Purchased for my wife as a Christmas gift. She's happy! <end>  Creative styling...  I used to buy these 20 years ago at The Broadway. (store that is no longer in existence)I finally found them again in Sedona, Arizona, and when I got home, discovered them on Amazon. The vendor responds immediately and there are many styles to choose from. Silver Forest earrings are very unique, beautifully styled, and affordable. <end>  Love, love, love, love, love!  I get compliments all the time on these earrings. These are one of my favorites and to be honest I have started a little collection from this company of assorted earrings. I love all their line of earrings and have bought several different pairs. They are unique, exquisite, dainty and perfect for gifts! <end>  earrings  I love Silver Forest earrings. They are comfortable and beautiful. I always get lots of compliments on them and people ask where I got them. I tell them <end>
 B0009J5UZM  Sterling Silver 36 Inch CZs by the Yard ||	  36 Inch CZ by the Yard  The Sterling Silver 36 Inch CZs by the Yard was a great buy. Thus far I have received several compliments.

 B0009J6C40  6mm White Freshwater Pearl and Sterling Silver Stud Earrings ||	  so delicate!  These pearls are perfect for teenagers. They give my daughter a touch of elegance everytime she wears them, but with no exaggerations! <end>
 B0009JCJ24  Sterling Silver Starfish Necklace ||	  great buy!!!  i purchased this as a gift. and she loved it so much that she asked for the matching earrings. it still looks the same as when i bought it 2years ago, nice and shiny! much cheaper than the Tiffany's Brand!!!! Eve's addiction is a great place to purchase jewelery! i am never buying from anywhere else again!!! <end>  Great Quality Pendant for Price!!  This is a great little Tiffany's-style pendant for a fraction of the price. I own a few rings and pendants from Tiffany's myself and was looking for cheaper items to wear on vacation (for fear of damage and theft) and found Eve's Addiction via Amazon. Instead of just for vacation, I am finding myself wearing the pendant with my regular outfits.The starfish is nicely styled, of a nice weight, not hollow like someone else mentioned about other silver pieces, and has a nice (not cheap-looking) shine. It definitely gets noticed. The chain itself has a nice quality and uses a sturdy lobster clasp. I ordered the 16" chain and am only 5'0 and felt that the chain was slightly short. If you are taller, I would go for the 18" chain.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. It is a quality pendant for the discounted price. It was shipped quickly, came in a little velvet pouch, and inside a small box. I am looking forward to checking out EA's other pieces and these items will make great gifts! <end>  Love it!  This necklace came in the mail very quickly and was perfect. It came with a very nice box and bag as well. I love the necklace itself and wear it everyday! <end>  Pretty casual wear  The pendant is quite small, so this is best for casual daytime jewelry. It doesn't really seem to attract a lot of attention, but I like it a great deal. <end>  Chain looks cheap!  My husband bought this for me for Christmas because I have been wanting one really bad. He got the 16 inch chain..big mistake! It is too small for my liking and it looks very cheap! It is not a finer chain it looks like something I would give to a child. Well thats ok I will just exchange it for one of my own, well that can not happen because the hole is too small to allow you to exchange necklaces...UGH!! The pendent itself is cute and well made not cheap or thin...just wish they never put that chain on it!!! If it wasnt for me not wanting to upset my husband I would return this in a heartbeat! Wow I just reviewed the order...looks like my hubby ordered the 18 inch chain but we got a 16 inch chain...that I measured to make sure! <end>  EXTRAORDINARY SELLER  I encourage everyone to order an item from Eve's Addiction. They will do the very best to make you happy and to insurethat you are pleased with any item you order. They have fantastic customer service, which is very hard to find these days.Shop and order now. You will not be disappointed. <end>  Very Cute!  I have received many compliments on this necklace! Great quality for the price. Very cute with the matching earrings. <end>  Great gift!!!  I bought this for my sister and she loved it!!! It's nice quality and was such a great gift! It came in a great box and bag and was packaged so perfectly so it wouldn't mess in the mail...I may just get one for myself!  ) <end>  Silver Starfish  Beautiful sterling silver starfish necklace. Nice weight, 16" is the perfect length. Have received many compliments. Very nice quality. <end>
 B0009JHWFS  Cute Stretchy Natural Carnelian Bracelet ||	  Nice stone!  This was a gift for my mother after saw a carnelian stone on my mixed stone bracelet. <end>
 B0009JQAKQ  Antique Style Green Crystal Flower Leverback Earrings ||	  Beautiful earrings  I received these very quickly in a lovely little black velvet pouch. The earrings measure 1" across at the center circle and a full 2" from the top of the hook to the bottom bead. They are a lot bigger than I thought they were, but I was pleasantly surprised to see them actual size. They can get to be a little weighty, so I remove them after a few hours.They are a real treat! <end>  I'll give as a gift  These earrings were not what I expected. I'm going to have to learn not to purchase earrings online as I tend to love the pictures of them but not the jewelry when I get it. They are pretty but way too big for me. They are much too heavy and I would never find them comfortable. They are constructred fairly well although the back level that goes through the ear is a little too short. I have a friend that may like them, so I kept them and will send them to her. I also paid only $5 for them butd it cost me almost that much in postage. I certainly do not want to have to pay postage to send them back. If you are looking for a large, heavy earring then you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for smaller more petite earrings, do not purchase these. <end>  too big  These earrings are much bigger than they appear in the photo.I am not very fond of them. <end>  Beautiful and different earrings  These earrings are not as versatile as some I have purchased through Amazon.com, but they are noticeable and get good comments. When friends ask where I got them, they don't realize you can get such nice earrings on Amazon.com, so I've passed the word to try it. The leverbacks are my favorites, anyway, and these are very comfortable! <end>  Victorian dream earrings  I need to buy some clothes to match these earrings. My wardrobe doesn't match this style yet, although I did wear them yesterday. I do love the old-fashioned, Victorian appeal of these earrings. <end>  vintage chic  This earrings are great, especially for this price.They are good match with vintage clothes and others. <end>
 B0009JQBXM  Antique Inspired Sapphire Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  Sent it back. Too fake.  The picture is great. The blue stone is very fake like blue plastic. No way does it look like a sapphire or any other stone. The color is horrible. The silver is very light weight and cheap too. <end>
 B0009KNC5Q  Sterling Silver 12mm Italian Mesh Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  BAD BRACLET  Very Very Very upset with this order. I loved it when I got it, but it fell off my wrist three times the first week I had it on. Then it finally fell off and stayed off. GONE.........so what the problem was is that the clasp was cheap, and it wouldnt stay on my write, so Im pretty annoyed that I spent the money and I lost it in a week or two. Wasted my money, and loved it. I wont order off this company anymore, because they have to know how cheap the clasp was, they are selling them to alot of people. I for one, use Amazon so much, its crazy. I spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars every month. This is the only piece of jewelry that I ever purchased that I had this problem with, so that tells me that most of thier jewelry is like this, and that is why It was the price that it was, because it was cheaply made, problem is you can sell cheap stuff, but for gosh sakes, does it have to be so cheap that it falls off all the time, in the long run the money just falls off your wrist. <end>  Beautiful bracelet--but the fastener is difficult and unusable (made in China I'm guessng)  I love this bracelet, but when I tried it on right out of the box  I could not fasten it to put it on, it did not lay flat when my husband fastened it for me--and it took him a while too. And it took a long time to get it UNfastened. I've seen clasps like these on other bracelets--and they never work--or you break them the first time to try to get them off. I'm disapointed something like this --woudl sell too at $44, with such a poor clasp design. Do not buy it, you will be sorry, and it will be a waste of money. I returned it immediaely for a refund. <end>  Not what I expected  The bracelet was not what I expected from the picture shown. It was made well, but was not bright silver, but looked more like stainless steel. I returned the item. <end>  unhappy customer  quality of this product is horrible, its was breaking apart in less than a week. the materials used to make this product were very cheap!! <end>  Meh.  I was hoping for something a little shinier, a little more delicate, I suppose. I saw another review that said it was smaller than they were expecting, and from my perspective, the photo portrayed the size pretty adequately. The links are wider and more square than I thought they would be. The clasp is adequate, but the manner in which it's joined to the body of the bracelet leaves something to be desired. The joins are hollow (which, if you look at it, makes sense - the body of any bracelet has height, and each clasp ends in a loop), but unfortunately it's not as strong as you'd hope. One of the joins has gotten smooshed a bit, as I'm not a delicate little flower, and since they haven't been welded nicely, they rub on and pull fibers off of some materials. I can push the ends back together with my fingers, which is convenient, but doesn't really speak kindly for the quality of construction.All in all, I think I overpaid, and it's not really my style anyway. Perils of buying jewelry online, I suppose. <end>  Nice bracelet  Tbis is a very nice bracelet, good quality. It looks a little different than the picture, but overall a good buy. My only complaint is that the clasp is a little chunky. <end>  Well worth the money  I had ordered this as a retirement gift from a group of people, but after seeing it I want one for myself. It is a nice weight and looks like I paid much more for it than I actually did. As a matter of fact after everyone saw it, I have been appointed the official retirement gift shopper because I did so well. <end>  Three Stars  This bracelet was much more thin than I anticipated. I am still satisfied with the bracelet overall. <end>  bracelet  given as a gift to my niece , it was exactly as I thought and looks beautiful on her. Thanks <end>  braclet  Just beautiful. This bracelet is wide enough to be seen and soft enough to bend to your wrist and movement. I like it much better than a cuff bracelet. I DEFINATELY MAKES A STATEMENT. <end>  Simple and Classy  I got this as a gift, and really like the look of it. The bracelet is simple, comfortable and classy. The clasp is a little difficult to latch, and may look better with a smaller more delicate clasp, but it works just fine. Overall I'm happy with the bracelet and have received several compliments. <end>  Favorite every day bracelet  This bracelet is simple, elegant, shiny and lovely. I'm delighted with the quality, the beauty and have worn it every day for several weeks now. Love it! <end>  Love this  I like simple silver when i where jewelry.Quality is good,it's one size fits all. This is the perfect accent for casual or dressy attire <end>  very pretty  Very nice braclet, something for everyday or the nite out...Looks beautiful with jeans or dress. Work or play..Good Quality! Packaged nicely too. <end>  Silver Mesh Bracelet  The bracelet is comfortable and good for everyday. The only problem is the bracelet I received looked used and was dull and had scratches on it. I thought I was purchasing a new product -- for the price I paid. <end>  This item shines....  Very nice bracelet at a very good price. Nice weight to it, looks very good on the wrist. Very pleased. <end>  sterling silver mesh 7.5 bracelet  my husband bought me this bracelet for valentines day. i love it. you can dress it up or down.it came in its onw little bag and box"which i like"for easy storage when i'm not wearing it. shipment was on schedule from amazon. #5 for this gal, i'll definitly be ordering again. <end>  nice bracelet  The silver mesh is flexible, and the clasp seems well made. Though some reviewers have complained that it's too narrow, the proportions are just about what you would expect from the picture.The only complaint is that there is no size adjustment, so it's one size fits all.I would buy again. <end>  Nice, lightweight  I ordered this bracelet as a gift and ended up keeping it for myself. It is a bit difficult to fasten, but doable. I like the look of it, the weight, overall it looks very nice. <end>  Very Nice Bracelet  It's a pretty piece. The lobster claw is quite stiff, so you will have to get used to putting it on. Also, it seems like it bends if I lay my arm down on something hard (stuff on my desk, counter edges...). But I don't have any kinks in it yet. Given the price and the quality, I would buy it again. <end>  pretty but a little small  bought it as a birthday present for my best friend, sadly the fit was a little small ;( but she still loves it <end>  I love it  I never take it off and it lasts through showers, dealing with 27 students a day, teaching gymnastics, washing the car, etc. It is a lot stronger then I thought it would be. It also keeps it bright shine. For the cost it is the best. <end>  Great Bracelet  This is a great bracelet for anyone who finds wearing bracelets and working on a computer to be uncomfortable. The thin, mesh design of this piece is incredibly comfortable and can go from casual to dressy. Great addition to my jewelry collection. <end>  Nice Bacelet!  Very nice stylish bracelet. Its different styling from regular sterling silver bracelets in that it is much wider. My wife thought it was a very nice gift for Christmas. I am happy with the purchase since she is. <end>  Great bracelet  A great bracelet at a wonderful price. Comfortable to wear with a lot of style and substance. Unlike most inexpensive bracelet, this one has a lot going for it. Nicely finished with a large lobster claw clasp. Very happy with the purchase. <end>  She loves its  My wife loves the look, and feel of this bracelet. I love the way she makes it look. Good build quality in the clasp and finish. <end>  This One Is Just Okay  You get what you pay for. Definitely need to pair this one up with additional bracelets. This one is just okay. <end>  Italian Mesh Bracelet  It was a gift for my daughter from her mother-in-law which I ordered from Amazon. My daughter really likes it and as usual the order was handled quickly and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas. <end>  12mm sterling mesh bracelet  This was a gift for my Mom. She loves sterling bracelets and has quite an assortment already. I wanted to get her something simple but unlike any of her others. She loves it. <end>  bracelet  it was a gift for my Daughter and she sure love's it. I would recommend it to anyone. Very elegant. <end>  Sterling Silver 12mmMesh Bracelet  I love this bracelet~ it is everything I was hoping it would be- sylish, wearable for everyday and very comfotable. Looks great on the wrist. Great product! I would love to find more bracelets like this one at that price <end>  Dull in appearance  Was very dissapointed in the overall look of the product. The silver was very dull ... clasp sticks - hard to open ... Not sure if I'm going to keep this ... <end>  Big hit!  Wife absolutely loves this bracelet, although the latch is a little hard to do herself. Very pretty and delicate work. <end>  Great buy  This bracelet was a great gift for my wife. She loved the styling and the light weight quality of the bracelet. Looks more expensive than what it really was.No complaints here. <end>  Pretty everyday bracelet  I received this as a gift and I love it. It is pretty and simple and perfect for everyday. It is flat and comfortable and doesn't bother me when working on the computer at work. <end>  Are you feeling lucky?  I actually bought two of these and both are very pretty and are well worth the price tag if....you are feeling lucky. Both were delivered seperatly and were cramed into the cardboard boxes with little care. The first one was visibly damaged on the side which given the packing, it did not suprise me. The second one still had a jewlers ball-bearing stuck in the hook end of the clasp which keeps the silver from crimping when the jewler presses the thin metal together over the end. That was repairable as not only did the ball-bearing need to be removed but also the metal needed to be closed correctly. The width is wider than some are giving credit. I am not sure you would want anything larger?I will give Amazon 5 stars as usual for the ease of dealing with an issue. Even though it will take 3-5 weeks for a replacement (they are awaiting more stock from Italy and you can not hold that against them) it was my choice to take the replacement over a quick refund. As I said, they are certainly worth the price. <end>  Way too small and thin  bracelet is too small and too thin. Does not look like a high quality piece of silver. Don't waste your money. <end>  not bad, but smaller than the photo makes it look  This is well made sturdy silver with a quality clasp. My only real complaint is that it looks surprisingly small compared to the photo here. <end>  Love this Braclet.  I like simple silver when i where jewelry. This is the perfect accent for casual or dressy attire. Quality is good. Thickness is just right. Any thicker it would not be as flexible. <end>  Simple yet elegant  I bought this for everyday wear. It is a simple style that will go with everything. It is sturdy and the clasp has a good grip. I found that when I put on a long-sleeve jacket, it gets caught in the material. Just be cautious when wearing a knitted garment so not to pull threads. <end>  Buyer Beware  This bracelet is very poorly made. The clasp looks like cheap bent metal reminiscent of children's jewelery. It going to cost me $4.95 to send this back, which I am sure is more than the bracelet is truly worth. Don't waste your time or money! <end>  It's nice  It doesn't look super expensive like everyone else says it does. It is a VERY petite braclet, but it is nice, and I wear it with nice clothes. <end>  Sandra's View " hated it"  The bracelet arrived in a timely manner. The silver looks very cheap and the bracelet is very, very thin, which I hated. I wore it a few times and put it away. I will not be wearing it again ( <end>  I'd buy it again  I was satisfied with the quality of this bracelet...it looked more expensive than it was and I love how it looks on my wrist. It was way too big for me though; if it were a few inches shorter it would have been perfect. I took it to a jewelery store to see if it could be sized, and they said that they would have to sauder it which would ruin the finish and expose the silver and it would tarnish easier. The guy at the store advised me that sizing it would not be the best idea. So, it's a great bracelet, I just wish it was 6 1/2 inches instead of 7 1/2. <end>  mesh bracelet  Sterling Silver 12mm Italian Mesh Bracelet, 7.5"Bought this for myself for birthday & it lives up to the positive reviews already written. Can be worn with most anything which is a plus. This will make a super gift for any female-about 14yo & up-for most any occasion & sure can't beat the price. My 25yo is going to get one for b-day too. <end>  What?  Shittttay, not even close to good craftsmanship, made in Italy my butt. Came with a tag that says Honduras. Waste of money. <end>  So In!  I love it! The design of it reminds me of the chain armor from the Lord of the Ring, it is light and so gorgeous. <end>  sterling silver bracelet  This bracelet could have been made narrower and thicker. Good value though. Especially for young person. Your word requirement for these reviews is very annoying! <end>  WEaring it right now  OMG I love this bracelet. It is a great size and it's a great fit. It looks great and I receive a lot of compliments on it. I recommend it to anyone who loves silver! <end>  Not what I expected...  This bracelet definitely looks bigger and of better quality in the picture. It's ok but not what I was expecting. <end>  very shiny and its a perfect fit...  i like this braclet knowing its a bit of a hassle for me to put on until i figure out a way to get it on by myself lol, but its nice it is kinda bendable but it can come back out like it was which is good i guess, just dont get it hung on something cause it may brake it, i know there is a peice thats by the clump that kinda is pushed in someway but idk if that was how it came or not.i really do like the mesh look and got many comments on it, and it feels good on my skin as well.. i like it and i hope this helps you in getting one possibly... <end>  Bracelet  I love this item. Its so lovely and is even better than the photo. Worth every cent! If you are looking for terling silver then you will want this item! <end>  It made her happy, so I'm happy  She loved it. Made a great gift. I am surprised by how durable this thing is. Great construction. Looks great on her, too. <end>  smaller than expected  thought it wuold be a little more glamorous and wider. Not as big as I hoped. Heading out to get a small gift to compliment it as its not enough for XMAS alone. <end>  Beautiful!!!  This is a beautiful bracelet, it's elegant, moves fluidly, and looks great with any outfit. I'll be wearing it on special occasions and I absolutely love it!!! <end>  Beautiful, dainty and elegant, great price - terrible packaging  This bracelet is a Christmas gift for our daughter. It exceeds our expectations for the price, it is so pretty. The packaging is terrible and I am surprised it didn't get broken. I have to find a box to put it in for Christmas, it really takes away from the beauty of it. What a shame. <end>  Too little  Too thin I've bought better quality for the same price. Although it is pretty it is for small wrists and feels too delicate. <end>  Picture's much better than the item!  I was totally disappointed when I received this bracelet. The photo makes it look like a very classy and quality item when in fact it's very thin and looks and feels very inexpensive. I probably will never wear it. <end>  Nice bracelet!  This bracelet was just the width I was looking for. It's got a big lobster clasp on it that is easy to handle. It goes very well with my diamond tennis bracelet, too! <end>  Mom likes it!  This was a little gift I bought my Mother just because, two weeks ago.. It is ok... My Mother loves it and has not taken it off since I purchased it. Right now I am keeping an eye on luster. So far so good. I'll keep you posted. <end>  bracelet  It is a little expensive but looks quite nice. The bracelet site nicely on my write. Lucky that it fits just right. I think if my wrist was smaller, it would not look as nice <end>  Great Valentine's Day Gift  I bought this for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. She loved it and it seems to hold up well. Very good deal for the price! <end>  Just Beautiful  My Mother In Law absolutely loved this. Have not seen it yet for my self. But it brought tears to her eyes. <end>  Nice Bracelet  For the money, this is a nice, sturdy bracelet. However, I could not give it 5 stars due to the fact that it is not polished to a high shine which I would have preferred. It has more of a matte finish. I wear it everyday, and have not had a problem with it. If you like the more subtle, matte finish, this bracelet is for you. <end>

 B0009LFFGO  Sterling Silver Cape Cod Style Bangle Bracelet and Earrings Gift Boxed Set (8")(Lengths 6",7",8") ||	  the boxed set from silver insanity is a very good price  when you purchase a Cape Cod bracelet at a Cape Cod jeweler the price is over 100 dollars. The earings are also expensive. the quality of the boxed set from silver insanity does not compare. The bracelet is a much lighter weight and i would not expect the screw ball to have a long life.choose the heavier weight cape cod bracelets if you want to wear this all the time. <end>  The Original  I got this bracelet when I was in Boston visiting for a wedding that I was in. I saw everyone wearing it, it's staple item there. I wanted one so bad so my friend took me to her local jeweler to get one. I feel in love when as soon as I put it on. I wear it everyday. It's tough enough to with stand everyday wear and you will never have to take it off. I even wore it in the wedding and it was nice enough that it didn't stand out it looked like it was suppose to be there. I love it and I would love to have one or two more. I am also going to get one for my daughter. With the screw ball closer I don't have to worry about her taking it off and anything happening to it. <end>  Good quality for the money  I think this is the product set that I just received as a gift. It's obviously not from Eden on Cape Cod but very similiar. It's a very delicate, simple set and looks very nice on. It seems to be of pretty decent quality too. <end>
 B0009LFWDU  Amazon.com  Clava Zip Top Shopper Handbag  Kitchen &amp; Dining ||	  Perfect gift  Bought this as a gift for my daughter-in -law who is going back to school for her MBA. She wanted a "bookbag" that wasn't the canvas bag from undergraduate days. She LOVES the purse and she is VERY particular. The leather is soft, the zipper allows for safety and there is room for her many "gadgets". It is a beautiful bag. I recommend it without reservation.JRM <end>
 B0009MD5VA  14K White Gold 7 mm CZ Stud Earrings Brilliant Cut Basket Set 2 1/2 Carat Size ||	  Faulty backs, less gold  The stones looked good but the metal is a little whimpier than what amazon pictured.I only give it 2 stars because the backs did not fit snug enough to keep the earrings on and one fell out the first day I wore them. So due to the faulty backs I no longer have a pair of earrings. I emailed to see if I could return just the one, and they did get right back to me, but with a no. They did say however that I could purchase one for $14.57 plus shipping by calling them... not worth it! <end>  "Exactly"  When buying on line in general, we try our best to find an item which is closest to what we are looking for, and then, on some level, speaking for myself, I keep my fingers crossed, for until you get it, you really never know. This beautiful 7MM CZ Stud Earrings couldn't be any more beautiful, couldn't have come any quicker, and exceeded all my expectations. Great Quality, Great Sparkle, Great Price and a Great seller, Simply Wonderful <end>  PERFECT  Just perfect, gift arrived days before Christmas and expected delivery date in beautiful box, no wrapping paper needed. Will be ordering with Sabrina Silver again very soon. Thank You Sabrina Silver.14K White Gold 1 1/4 Carat Size (7 mm ea) Brilliant Cut Basket Set CZ Stud Earrings <end>  Seem nice...hope they hold up.  Bought these for my step daughter and they are very pretty. I like the style/shape of the metal prongs/basket used vs many of the CZ earrings I've seen out there...plus they are real gold. That's a plus. I got these for $35 plus shipping, better than the $45 being asked now. I'll say that for the money I'll be very satisfied with these...as long as they hold up. The prongs/baskets seem pretty frail/thin. Let's hope the CZ's don't fall out. <end>  earrings  The earrings are beautiful. They are sturdy and the setting is really pretty. I wish that they showed a picture of them in a person's ear so that I could have a better idea of how big they are. I wouldn't have purchased this size, they are pretty big. <end>
 B0009N5PSK  JJ Weston gold plated moonlight sail yacht cufflinks with presentation box. Made in the USA ||	  Ordered a replacement pair  I had a pair of these and quite enjoyed them. The gold plating didn't flake or anything, and I often got nice comments on them. I ended up giving them to a visiting friend (a sailor), and thus needed to order a replacement pair. <end>
 B0009NKFV2  Diamond Hoop Earrings in Yellow Gold (with Safety Lock) ||	  Little Wolf  The moment I opened these and felt the weight, I knew they were a quality product. They manage to look so elegent and delicate, but they are made to last and the secure lock is a marvel. This is one pair that, unlike many others, won't break my heart when I look in a mirror and find I only have one. I love these! <end>  Small with funny color  The earring is very small!It does not look golden. It has a funny silver color.The stone has NO clarity and, if not 1 inch from the eye, you cannot say it is pink. Also, funny color.One of the earrings' closing device does is loser than the other and the &#34;safety locker&#34; does not seem much useful.It really disappointed me. <end>
 B0009NV4BM  Circle - Fashion Hoop Earrings Set of 6 Pairs in Graduated Sizes - Silver ||	  EXCELLENT!! PERFECT CONDIDTION!!! PRODUCT CAME EARLY!!  THANK YOU..PRODUCT VERY SATISFIABLE...AND MINT CONDITION@@!!!THANK YOU..LOOK FORWARD TO BUYING FROM YOU AGAIN..ALSO GREAT COST!!NICE!!VERY NEW!! PERFECT CONDITION GOOD PRICE!! DEFINITELY WOTH BUYING FROM YOU AGAIN!! <end>  Happy Girl and a beautiful Purchase  To all whom are thinking about buying from this supplier please note that it is everything and more. The earrings are beautiful and have a great look to them and the value is equally as impressive. Please don't hesitate - my fiance loves the earrings and I highly encourage you to purchase from this supplier as the pricing, shipping, and service are all professional.She is truly the fashion angel! <end>  Earrings set  El producto llego en malas condiciones, no quede satisfecha con los dos set adquiridos por eso efectue la devolucion. En estos momentos no estoy interesada en adquirir este tipo de producto ya que lo hice a traves de otra opcion de comercio, deseo puedan corregir este tipo de error para el futuro. El producto cumplia los requisitos exigidos por mi, por ello lo seleccione para la adquisicion. <end>  Cheap  I guess this is one of those times that I got what I paid for. They are very cheaply made. The clasps do not close good. Waste of money! <end>  Perfect  My daughter was pleased with the quality and quick service she received from this company.They arrived quickly and she was very happy with the products.She has been wearing the earrings non stop and her friends all want to borrow them! <end>  Good  Its good for the price and its just as the seller describe them, the colors are good and the sizes are as you can see in the picture.. No regrets.! <end>  Ok  The earrings are very nice however I was looking for smaller earrings for the top of my ear. The picture was very small and no size of any of the earrings was given so I was left to guess as to the size. It turns out they are all waaay too big for what I was looking for and I feel stuck with them because it will cost me more money to return them. <end>  Nice start out or addition to your earring collection.  These earrings are perfectly sized from small to large. I got the black and white set. They're really pretty with short or long hair. The only reason I am leaving a 4 star instead of 5 is because they do bend a bit and you have to be a little more careful, also some of the color coating comes off so you really have to be aware of how you take care of them. I have black hair so the black ones don't really show through my hair while the white ones are very stark. I wear the white ones with my hair down and the black ones with it up, so I always have a pair no matter how I have my hair done. I really liked that they have so many sizes, it added a nice start to my hoop collection. I always have a set in! <end>  Cheaper can be better  I was shopping around for earrings ,am a gold,silver and pearl girl,and i like balance ,i came across these beauties i read the reviews ,some good ,some well not so good ,i care for all my jewelry in the same manner no matter the cost ,must say ...I LOVE THIS SET OF EARRINGS !!!... if my girls lose one i dont have to scream and stomp the floor ,the quality of the earrings great!! and the price !!! let the rainbow shine ,the bigger ones in the set will go as as gifts ,this is a great deal ,the weight is perfect on my ears, and they r no hassel putting them on to wear .if you think they look great in the picture wait until you see them on you .if its not about the price but about the quality this item is worth checking out,you can not go wrong if you care for this jewelry as you would your higher priced jewelry, <end>  gold hoops  I got these hoops to make basketball wives earrings i like these and worth it and cute and small for people who don't want them that big <end>  the best hoop earrings  i ordered these earrings because of the price . these are a great set with decent back clips i was really amazed at well made they were and delivery was super fast. love these earrings they are my favorie, pick your size <end>  Very nice earrings  These earrings are exactly what I wanted and my gf likes them very much. She says the clasp works, they're light weight, and the color is not dull, it's shiny. <end>  Great service  It was fast service and a great product i got it in time and my mom loved the earrings Plus it came in on her birthday so she was even more suprised. <end>  Nice for Price  I was really surprised at the quality of this set of silver hoop earrings, especially priced as low as they were. I tend to lose earrings but they latch securely and I've already received several comments on them. Little do they know what a deal they were! <end>  Nice collection of earrings & sizes.  Nice collection of earrings & sizes --- light weight, nice quality... thin... not "too loud or big"..they come with a great clasp for assured safe-keeping while on. The gold appears a little more dressy and the silver for those casual jean days! <end>  Great Look  These are now my favourite earrings, I have gotten a great many compliments on how they look on me. I have long straight brown hair, and these give just enough curves to make my hair look lots better. <end>  Gold colored earrings that tarnish!  These earrings look great when you take them out of the package but after one use they tarnish and turn brown! <end>  Earrings  Though these earrings look fantastic when in, they feel sort of cheap and flimsy and are difficult to put on and take off without bending. <end>  earings  Large variety of sizes. We like the quick release so ears do not get torn if it gets caught on something. <end>  Cheap  If you want them for a costume cool. If you've got 5 sisters ranging in age, and want a set that looks like it's the same size on each of them, good option for very little $, but you get what you pay for. Cheap &#34;metal looking&#34; hoop earrings. <end>  Nice gift for an exwife.  These things are junk. I think I'll let my daughter give them to my wife for Christmas so I don't get blamed for buying them. <end>  Very fast delivery  Received the item very quickly. I think 7 days with the free shipping. The product was in great condition. Not a complaint at all but since the item is a gift a small box would've been useful. <end>  Fashion Hoop Earrings Set of 6 Pairs in Graduated Sizes  I was not exactly expecting much at this price, but was pleasantly surprised when these earrings arrived. Look great, nice gold color and they don't irritate my ears. <end>  gold earrings  I really liked the different sizes and they are very nice. I will be ordering again from them. I told all my friends about them and they really are surprised and said they will be ordering some for themselves. <end>  Can't live without them  I love these earrings. The got here fast, were an excelent price. I wear three pair everyday. They are simple and well made. I just can't live without them. <end>
 B0009NWQ28  Reconstituted Turquoise 5mm Band Stone Ring Size 4.5 ||	  Turquoise Band  This is a beautiful ring. I'm even wearing it right now! The ring may be synthetic, but it shows the variations in color and stands out to people around you.The shipment was packed safely and arrived before the estimated date. A wonderful addition to my jewelry. <end>  This one is an "eye-catcher"  This ring is like a breath of fresh air and has a summery feel for me. It is a pretty complementary or contrasting color for so many outfits and my eye is always drawn to it. I am very happy with my purchase. I bought quite a few gemstone rings from Amazon and hesitated to buy this one, thinking, "Do I really need this?" Glad I did! <end>  Very pretty ring.  This ring is gorgeous. It fits perfectly and is very comfortable to wear. I'll do all my ring shopping here from now on. A good experience. <end>  Rings & Things  This turquoise ring is as pretty as the picture advertised; the black lines are just as deep. It wears quite well and is as solid as expected. You will have no regrets on this purchase. <end>  really cool looking...  ...but order a larger size than you think you'll need, because the bands are thick and since it's entirely stone there's not as much "give" as with a metal ring. The turquoise one I ordered was too small, I'll have to give it to my niece. <end>  Awesome ring!  Such a pretty ring! I would order a size up....or at least a half a size up. Because it's stone there isn't much leeway. But it's a really gorgeous ring...I love how the natural colors weave together. And the little box it came in was super cute! <end>  cute; order 1 size up  This is really, really cute. The colours are bold and vivid. It is fairly thick in terms of stick out from your finger. This would make it a good thumb ring, may be uncomfortable on your fingers. Be sure to order 1 size up. <end>  I love it  I received my turquoise band today.It came in a beautiful pink box with bow on top.The band is lovely.I am going to order another one. <end>  Beautiful but fragile  Wife loved the ring. Very pretty. Great color. Careful - fragile. Unfortunately the ring shattered when she smacked a table top. (Not out of anger.) <end>  Cute Boxes for each Ring!  Wow! Thank you, Gem Avenue for sending out my order so quickly! I received my package two days before the end of the delievery window and was VERY SATISIFIED! Each ring came in it little own box with a bow covered top and the ring inside a protective space. Unfortunately, I will have to return one because I guessed the wrong size for a friend. I will write a separate review on the exchange policy. But the rings are beautiful and I'm sure I'll order from Gem Avenue again!!! <end>  Happiness  I was not sure how the ring would look. The picture was ok, but could have given more detail. I found the ring pretty and I have recieved great reviews for the ring. Others thought it was a real Turquoise ring. I did not correct them. I plan on purchasing more rings as long as my size is available. <end>  Great turquoise color ring  What a great band ring! Wear it often and like the smooth feel and intense color.Lots of fun for a low price. <end>  Turquoise ring  I like my black gemstone ring and order the turquoise one for a friend.They liked it... <end>  Good buy  Worth more than the price, only knocked a star off for the sizing- no regrets with this one. <end>
 B0009OKARK  bdtr006s New Sterling Silver Toering Womens 6 MM Celtic Toe Ring ||	  Awesome!  I love it! I was a little leery about purchasing a toe ring online; as in person I often get the cheap ones that break after a day or turn your toe green. This one is quality and durable! And thats coming fromsomeone who stubs her toes - a lot! It came quickly. It was in adorable packaging. I haven't taken it off! <end>  Great Celtic Ring!  Great ring, as pictured. Received it in a few days. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's a little big, so it shifts on my toe, even though the ends are touching. Other than that, I love it! <end>
 B0009P3C4M  Sterling Silver Moveable Angel Wing Charm Pendant ||	  An Absolutely GORGEOUS Angel!  I love this piece!! Made of nice, solid silver, it's sculpted into a beautiful, serene angel--and she's so "lifelike" even her wings move! It has a nice bale which will fit most of your sterling chains. If you love angels and beautiful sterling jewelry, this one's for you!! <end>
 B0009P4Q4M  Southwestern Style Three Dimensional Wolf Head Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay Wolf Paw Prints for Men or Women, Sizes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, #11874 ||	  Seems Like a One-of-a-Kind Ring  This wolf ring is as beautiful in RL as it is in the pictures. Artfully crafted, of sound design. This ring is unlike any ring I've seen before, very unique. The band is thick enough that I need not worry that it will split from wear. The turquoise paws on either side of the wolf are a brilliant accent to the handsome wolf head. I have a deep passion for wolves and it has been difficult to find jewelry that reflects the beauty and strength of the wolf--this ring does that and more... <end>  Beautiful Wolf Ring!  I was afraid the chip inlay would pop out but after many unfortunate falls it is still in great condition.Looks Goooooood!Ahhwwooooooooooooo!!!! <end>  Wolf Ring with turquiose paws inlay  This ring is fantastic. Hgh quality, bright sterling silver. I got it for my friend who loves wolves and turquoise, he had a wolf ring and lost it. This was a Christmas present to replace it. <end>  Great!!  Fits my budget and looks really good! I did dip my hand in bleach water and it discolored my ring. I cleaned it up with a soft cloth and toothpaste then dried it with a dry soft cloth rubbing in one direction only and it shined back up. I was afraid I'd ruined it. Good looking ring!!! <end>  Quality-Comfort  I got a fairly accurate picture of the ring from other reviewers, so ordered, and was not disappointed. It came securely packaged in a plasticized water protective envelope (as evidenced having spent the day and night out in my yard- my big Lab got hold of it ). Next day I noticed what looked like an envelope in yard, and sent my Sheltie to go get it, and its My Ring!! Still in box, in two sealed envelopes in outer package still intact!! Ring, I think, comes smaller by one size as I wear an 11 and this was a 12 but fit perfectly, so everyone be aware, and order one size larger- it can always be made smaller cheaper and easier than making it larger. The detail on the ring is nice, 3D relief of wolf head, and smoothness of inlay is professional quality, real nice! Thanks Taos, I'd order again-someday.. Shipping was fast too. <end>  Fantastic 3D Realism  From the turquoise paw prints to the 3D Wolf, there is not one thing that is not beautiful. I put this sterling ring on and have not taken it off. The compliments on it's beauty and uniqueness are common. <end>  Great product  I was very impressed with the quick shipment and the quality of the product. I would highly recommend this seller to anyone that is looking for sterling silver rings or earring.Thanks for the prompt shipment. <end>  Wolf head ring  This is a beautiful ring. I bought it for my wife for Christmas, and she loves it. It seems to run about 1/2 to 1 size smaller than her other rings. <end>  Great Item  This is a really great ring. And with the price of silver at the moment it was a bargain. Quick delivery and response when I contacted the seller with a question. Will probably place additional orders in the near future. Thanks. <end>  As advertised  This ring is exactly as described and fits perfectly. The delivery was rapid and complete.Excellent vendor <end>
 B0009P8V5C  Unique Celtic Knot Maple Leaf Large Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Celtic earrings  these are a little longer than they look, but very beautifulfast shipper; pleasure to work with <end>  Stunning Earrings  These earrings are beautiful and exactly as described.

 B0009PO3GS  Signature Sterling Silver Teardrop Earrings ||	  LOVE THESE  BOUGHT THESE EARRINGS A WHILE BACK AND STILL WEAR THEM 3 TIMES A WEEK. THEY DONT TARNISH AND ARE VERY STURDY. WELL WORTH IT!! <end>
 B0009PW2BQ  Large Multicolor Puzzle Piece Autism Awareness Ribbon Pendant and Stud Earrings Set ||	  Perfect Item  Ever since I have started wearing this, I have been asked questions about autism. Because it is bold - it is a great conversation starter. One of the reasons I wear it is to create more awareness. This does that. It is eye catching and beautiful. I have been asked by many people where I found this. I absolutely love mine. <end>  Autism Pride!  With this set, you get a pair of earrings and a matching pendant all done in the autism primary-colored jigsaw motif. The pendant comes with the slogan, "Open Your Eyes & Heart!" It also has 3 charms that are attached to it.There are many people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum who belong to a website proclaiming, "I'm a person, not a puzzle!" Still, people with autism are considered enigmatic people just as the neurotypical (NT) population is just as enigmatic to those on the a/A spectrum.While I love it and feel it instills pride, I can understand the justice on both sides. As for myself, I wish I had this set along with an umbrella emblazoned with this logo bearing the insciption NO RAIN MEN HERE! ("Rain Man" has become quite an offensive term in many a/A circles because it perpetuates a stereotype and savantism applies to less than 10% of the a/A population.) Such an umbrella impresses me as a humorous way of instilling pride and warding off the rain of tired stereotypes about autism. <end>
 B0009Q4P88  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 12.5 ||	  Beautiful Ring  I bought this ring for my fiance as his wedding band for our upcoming wedding. It's a beautiful ring. High quality. The milgrain detailing gives it a unique touch. I am very happy with this purchase. You won't be disappointed. <end>  Exactly as Advertised  The picture of this ring was precisely what I received. After searching on several sites for the one ring I could wear when my bridal set is too much for an occasion, I finally found this one. The quality is exceptional and the presentation was a nice display suspended high on a carpet of black velvet.If a casual but tasteful band is what you are looking for, this is it. The detailing around the edges is so elegant and the gold is so highly polished that it looks like a piece of art. <end>  14k Yellow Gold 5mm milgrain Half Round Band  I bought this for my husband as a replacement for his original wedding band that had to be cut off when he was operated on for carpal tunnel syndrome. He likes it better than his original. I would say this is good testimony after over 17 years of marriage. <end>  Wonderful value  I bought this ring for my fiance for our wedding and it is perfect. It is exactly the same ring we tried on in jewelry stores for double or triple the price. Great workmanship, lovely and shiny just like the picture. Also, I got my band (slightly thinner but otherwise the same) on a different website and they matched perfectly. We couldn't be happier with this purchase and my fiance will proudly wear this forever. <end>  great quality  this ring I bought for my fiancee as a committment to our relationship, and along with my ring both came in beautiful navy blue ring boxes and both polised to glistten like stars. I searched for about 4 months to find the right ring, and it was just as the picture described. The miligrain detailing adds an edge of uniqueness and I could not be happier with the product. Thanks to Amazon. <end>
 B0009Q4P9M  14k White Gold 6mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 13 ||	  Beautiful Wedding Band  It was worth the wait. When I received this package I could not believe how beautiful the wedding band was. It was much better than many of the other bands I've been shopping for in my area. I would recommend purchasing wedding bands from Amazon.Not only that, paying was easy and I give an A++ for shipping. Very fast! <end>  Great ring!  My fiance and I just ordered these rings for our upcoming wedding, and we are so happy with them. The rings are beautiful, exactly what you would find in a jewelry store for a fraction of the price. (Trust me--we have been to the jewelry stores and know that this is a fraction of the price.) After getting both our wedding bands and my engagement ring from Amazon, I am ready to recommend their jewelry to anyone who asks. We were able to get rings that would have been out of our price range had we been forced to shop at jewelry stores.I didn't get out my measuring tape to make sure that they were exactly 6 mm, but the important thing is that the rings match each other. I can understand that that would be a disappointment if one was trying to make it match a ring one already owns. The person who said the ring was a little small is correct--be careful with the sizing, because my engagement ring, when I had it sized, is supposedly a 6.5 and on the first try, the wedding band I got in 6.5 was a little tight and I had to go up to a size 7. Fortunately, with Amazon, returns are easy and you only have to pay shipping, which is much cheaper than paying the $20 I had to pay to have my engagement ring sized down.For those with concerns about buying wedding bands or an engagement ring from Amazon, fear not; no one can tell the difference between these rings and ones from a jewelry store. The people I've let in on my "little secret" are amazed and say they never would have guessed that our rings all came from online.Everyone should start purchasing their rings from Amazon--the quality is great and the price is unbelievable. My fiance and I couldn't be happier. <end>  A little small...  The ring is beautiful, but the size is a little small. I was sized at more than one local jeweller as a 9, but the ring was much too small. <end>  Overall Nice Band  The shipping was very quick. The band was pretty nice for the price, however when I compared this with a 6mm band from a jewelry store it was not quite as thick. But overall it is a nice band. <end>  Other Reviews Correct  I read all the reviews before ordering this ring along with the 14k white gold 4mm size 6. A lot of other reviewers said that this ring ran small. My soon to be husband and I decided to go ahead and order it large and then just have it sized if it didn't fit. Well, it didn't fit. When we took it to a jeweler it was about a 1/4 of a size smaller than listed. But it looks great, and is very shiny. We had it sized and have no other complaints. <end>  Very nice!!!  Just got married and wanted something that was a little on the thick side... I was under the impression that the ring was going to be smaller based on customer reviews but I figure I would go for it and see for my self. The ring is perfect, very simple, looks very nice and it is just what I expected. <end>  wonderful product  lovely item. but i followed the other customer reviews and ordered a half size up because they said it was sized smaller... well, it was too big.so i ended up sending it back to get my normal size.the quality looks wonderful. <end>  Very nice.  My husband loves this ring. He says it's very comfortable. The sizing isn't to accurate though. It was off by I think 1/4 which was just enough for the ring not to fit. We had it sized rather than return it. This was the second time I had to buy the ring. The first time they sent me a size 12! I had to return it & buy another ring & wait for my money to be refunded. VERY frustrating. I didn't want to have to do the return/buy thing again, that why we just went & had it sized. I figured it would be easier that way. Besides, what if they sent the wrong size yet again? BUT, it is an attractive ring. My husband wears it every day & never takes it off, unlike his old ring. The end result was what we wanted despite the initial headaches. If if wasn't for all the sizing issues I would have given it 5 stars. <end>  Looks great and is worth the money  The ring looks good and is definitely worth the money. The ring is not that comfortable but you get used to it. It is slightly thinner than 6mm but hardly noticeable. It looks great though! You wont find anything better for the price. A good buy. <end>  just as advertised  The ring is quite nice. The real thing looks just like the picture. The size was very slightly small, but close enough. <end>  Great Value  I received this ring quickly and it was just as I expected. It is a great value and nice looking ring. I shopped around at jewelry stores for similar rings, but this is definitely a better value. 14K gold for the price of a 10K ring in jewelry stores. I ordered a larger size than necessary because of other reviews although I am not sure that was necessary because I am now paying to have it down-sized. <end>  very nice  This is a very beautiful ring, very nice for the price. However, it does run small, so I would recommend buying a size larger than you normally would. <end>  not quite  I received the ring in only 2 short days ... fantastic. However the ring was advertised as 6mm, and falls a full .5mm shy of the 6mm band I'm currently wearing. <end>

 B0009WWDJK  Autism Awareness Puzzle Ribbon Charm Stretch Bracelet ||	  I LOVE THE BRACELET.  I love the bracelet!!! I wore the bracelet to work today, got many comments. I am ordering 3 more for friends. My son has autism and this is a great way to educate others. It is an excellent conversation piece. Thank you. <end>  A Great Cause  I bought this bracelet for the cause, I have so many compliments on it, it looks very nice, for the price I didn't quite know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I is sturdy. <end>  Autism Pride!  I love the bracelet and feel it instills autism awareness and pride. June 18 is not only Paul McCartney day; it is also Autism Awareness & Autism Pride Day. This beautiful bracelet with its bright, primary colors depicting the autism/Asperger's (a/A) jigsaw logo will go nicely with whatever one is wearing. What a gentle and, I think non-judgmental way of educating and piquing the world's collective interest in a/A. <end>

 B0009X9PTU  Celtic Double Trinity Knot & Blue Topaz Ring (size  7) ||	  Amazing!  I just got this for my best friend. She was almost in tears when she opened it! We live about 600 miles apart, and i didn't get to be with her for her birthday this year. So, being able to order this and have it sent to her for me was great! But being on the phone while she opened it was also great! She says it is small enough to not get in her way, and that she will be able to where it every where to remind her of the Trinity and the Love Christ has for her! Thank-you for making it possible to give her the perfect gift this year! <end>  too small  Very pretty, but beware, this ring is much smaller than the picture makes it look! <end>
 B0009XADFU  Reversible Passion Pink Gem Sultry Chandelier Top Dangle Belly Ring ||	  e  This is not hot pink like in the picture. This is baby pink. I hate baby pink and would never have bought this if I knew it was that color. If you like that color, thank this is fine. <end>

 B0009XY1H6  Sterling Symbol of Life Ring w/Turquoise Inlay ||	  Symbol of Life Turquoise Ring  I have seen similar quality rings in stores. I have had to pass on by due to the price. This ring is gorgeous, unique and affordable. I have had it several months now-still beautiful and that is with me subjecting it to just about everything.You will not find a better and more beautiful deal in turquoise! <end>  Will buy again!  I just received this ring and it is gorgeous. The weight of the sterling and the quality of the craftsmanship is unbelievable and for such a fabulous price.I will buy from this company again and again! <end>
 B0009Y4TE0  Sterling Silver Medieval BLUE LAPIS Armor Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  unique rings  WHEN I SAW THIS RING, I THOUGHT GOTTA HAVE IT. IT LOOKS GOOD-BUT BETTER, IT IS COMFORTABLE ON. AS ALWAYS I RECEIVED GREAT SERVICE. I AM A REAL LOVER OF RINGS-BUT NOT JUST ANY RINGS--UNIQUE ONES AND THIS ONE IS THAT. THE FINISH ON THE RING LOOKS GREAT WITH THE STONE. REGARDS, DONNA <end>  I like it  An interesting ring to have. It is not as delicate as the Wizards armor ring, but I like it. Works nice for either a casual or a dressier look. Try it! <end>  Great Service, but...  Shipping was timely and excellent, but the ring itself is less than satisfactory. I bought it for a friend, hoping that it would be a good gift for her-- and even though the silver is nice and shiny (though it does feel kind of cheap), the fit comfortable and smooth, I'm returning it because the "blue lapiz" sticks out like a wart. The picture makes the stone look more embedded into the ring... it's not. It sticks out for more than a good quarter inch, and has a scratched, imperfect surface. Just NOT aesthetically pleasing! <end>  finger armor  Great looking ring. I like things that are different -- not the every day run of the mill. It's a fun ring!!! <end>  Great  I Love this ring. It's a little small but I still love it. Lightweight for the size. It got here pretty fast. <end>  just as described  This ring looks just like the photo. On longer rings you need to remember to order alittle larger because they tend to fit the finger alittle tighter. The ring looks nice and is easy to clean. Alot nicer than most of the lapis rings I have looked at. <end>
 B0009YRC1W  Antica Murrina Cancun - Murano Glass Beads & Flowers Multi-strand Bracelet Multicolor ||	  Antica Murrina Veneziana Cancun Necklace, Bracelet & Earrings  Not even worth the 1 star!!! I purchased the Antica Murrina Veneziana Cancun Necklace, Bracelet & Earrings as a Christmas surprise for my sister on NOVEMBER 28th. I received a "your order has been shipped" email on NOVEMBER 30th with a tracking numbering. It is now DECEMBER 18th, and I still do not have my purchase!!! When I view UPS to track, it has been stuck in the UPS warehouse since DECEMBER 1st. I have called UPS over a half-dozen times and each person gives me a different answer as to why it's being held in customs. I finally got tired of doing the leg work and emailed FORZIERI (the jewelry vendor) 3 times to see if they had better luck. Someone finally emailed me back on DECEMBER 16th saying they would look into why it's being held. I have not received anything further from them. At this point I am extremely frustrated and disappointed. This was supposed to be a fun Christmas surprise for my sister who had this jewelry on her wishlist. I can't believe the time I'm spending just to get this package. <end>
 B0009YRC30  Antica Murrina Cuba - Amber and White Murano Glass Fashion Ring ||	  Nice  This piece was amazingly beautiful, but like most glass, it's fragile and a portion of the ring broke off after only a few wearings (apparently it hit against a checkout counter). Not sure why there is a gap in the bottom of the ring, but may have contributed. <end>
 B0009YV11E  Toe Ring - T32 - Crystal Illusion - Small Heart ~ Clear ||	  Too Small  I did not initially have an issue with my order. I ordered 2 toe rings, the first being a lady bug and fit fine, the second being the small heart. The band was way too small and definitely a size difference from the other toe ring from the same company. I emailed the seller and got a response and answered their questions. I was then told that they would look through the stock and send another one. A week went by and I never heard anything so I contacted the seller again via email. I got a response, again quickly, stating that the toe ring was sent the week. My original order took 4 business days to get here. This had been over 7 from that email. I never received a replacement and I cannot wear the original one. You can see a large size difference from the lady bug to the heart. It is upsetting that I cannot wear the toe ring. I thought that the company would have emailed tracking information or something. I do not see how I got the original package without any problems and the "replacement" never came. <end>

 B000A09URY  Cute Stretchy Blue Sodalite Chip Bracelet ||	  They Make Great Gifts  These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit.

I love wearing it with any outfit and love showing it off. Everyone loves it and asks where i got it. <end>
 B000A0ERQ8  Cute Stretchy Rhodonite Chip Bracelet ||	  They Make Great Gifts  These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit. Since they were so inexpensive, I was able to give everyone a gift. <end>  Attractive bracelet  I've purchased two of these - one I gave as a gift and one I kept for myself. I feel both were of good quality. <end>
 B000A0ERQI  Cute Stretchy Xian Jang Jade Bracelet ||	  Quite ok  The bracelet design is pretty good but the piece I got was damaged. <end>  Broken Bracelets  I am the seller of these bracelets. Because they are made of semi-precious gemstones, they do sometimes get damaged in shipping. We are happy to exchange them including free shipping. <end>
 B000A0FK7I  Cute Stretchy Dragon Jasper Bracelet ||	  Nice one!  The bracelet is very nice and the stone is almost a Jade variation. Kind of a Bluish/Greenish. It is a beautiful cut and color. <end>
 B000A0FKAU  Cute Stretchy Red Jasper Web Chip Bracelet ||	  Great color.  This bracelet has amazing color. The work that went into stringing it makes the prospect of the inevitable breaking of the elastic something I don't want to think about.Know that the bracelet I received is small. I have a 6 inch wrist and the bracelet I received hugs my wrist without any extra length at all. It is 1.5 inches wide. To say it is made of semi-precious stones means it is heavy. Beautiful and heavy. Did I mention the color is amazing?I added a photo of the bracelet with a ruler next to it. <end>  Red and White  This bracelet did indeed have beautiful color, but the one I received had some white stones that I wasn't expecting. If they had been spread around more I might have accepted it as a red and white bracelet which would have been cool, but they weren't, so I returned it. <end>
 B000A0W3FK  Multicolor Jeweled Flowering Ivy Top Dangle Belly Ring ||	  She loved it  I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. The picture provided doesn't give it enough justice. In her words its "cute, adorable and sexy". Give it as a gift or buy it for yourself <end>  Beautiful Ring!!!  This ring was very pretty and good quality. However, I personally found the top flower to be too heavy and wasn't able to wear it. <end>  Gorgeous!  I put it in as soon as i got it and i'm in love. its adorable! I wear it everyday and it doesn't get caught on my clothes or anything, i don't even realize i have it on. Great product! <end>  love it  Bought for my daughter, she loves it and looks like the picture shown. I would recommend to others to purchase <end>  Pretty!!  I love it, except that the petals are crooked. I still love it tho. The colors and design is pretty. <end>  Doesn't fit correctly  Ive noticed in the other reviews people commenting on how it looks and yes, it is beautiful in person. However, the bar is too long so it does not fit correctly. The top jewel will not lay flat against the skin because the bar is too long and it allows the top jewel to stick out. Idk, very pretty but not wearable. So it's useless <end>  Its not all that..  I bought this belly ring because its looked as if it is shiny, but its not. When I received it, part of the belly ring was turning brown, Im guessing from being old. I took alcohol and cleaned it, and it is as good as new. Im kind of dissapointed because it does not shine as much as I hoped and the colors are not as bright as they look in the picture. <end>  Cheap!  It was really pretty when I got it, but a little misshaped. I managed to manipulate it back into it's original design and put it in. However, within 48 hours of wearing it, the top diamond fell out. I then tried to remove it upon noticing what had happened and wouldn't you know it, the thing snapped off leaving the back rod part stuck in my navel! I had to maneuver it out awkwardly. Save your money. <end>  SO CUTE!  I haven't put this one in yet (just got it pierced) but it is so cute and is decent quality! <end>
 B000A13542  Crystalline Gem Shooting Star Top Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Ok...  Really cute, good quality. My only problem is that the upside down belly ring doesn't hang correctly it kind of droops because the bottom is so heavy. <end>

 B000A13ZVA  Tiny Sterling Silver Drama Masks Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Sterling Silver Stud Earrings  Very disappointed in the size. Not until this review request did the description state "Tiny". The word "Tiny" is an understatement."Microscopic" is a better description. I believe there will be a problem at any attempt to put these on the ear because they are absolutely too small. <end>
 B000A141WM  Tiny Sterling Silver Cross Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Religious Jewelry Fan  These earrings were a little flat for my taste, but at the price, they are worth the money and silver is always versatile. <end>

 B000A15X7O  Small Sterling Silver Airplane Non-Pierced Nose Ring (one piece) 7/16 inch ||	  cute airplane nose ring  i bought this as a joke. last year i fooled my sister with a fake tongue ring this year a nose ring. she's a flight attendant so i thought the airplane was a good choice. it's small and comfortable to wear. It has good detail to it also. i can't wait to use it on her! <end>

My daughter loved these earrings,and so did her older cousins(who are also Scorpio's)!! Great quality, and worth the price!! <end>
 B000A19GZ4  Sterling Silver Yin-Yang Stud Earrings, 3/8 X 5/16 inch ||	  These were a gift....  I bought these for my Mom and she loved this Ying/Yang stuff....but I thought these earrings would be a lot bigger. They were really tiny. She liked them but I was hoping they were bigger. <end>  Daughter loved these earrings  I thought these earrings were smaller than the picture online. But my daughter loved these yin/yang earrings. The quality & workmanship is very good. Happy with purchase. <end>  Ear rings  These earrings are pretty good. Pretty much what I expected. This is the second time I have purchased them. <end>
 B000A19GZO  Tiny Sterling Silver Heart Earrings 5/8 inch ||	  Nice silver heart earrings  Nothing fancy, but exactly as depicted. Pleased with purchase and price. <end>  Great quality!!

 B000A1ADQ0  Tiny Sterling Silver Screw Stud Earrings 1/4 inch ||	  Looks cheaper in the photo  I was afraid that these would be poorly made from the photo, but when they arrived they looked like somebody cut a small screw in half. It's a good quality earring. <end>  Screws  I had a slight problem with the shipping of this particular item, but was very satisfied with the way everything was handled. The item description was spot on. <end>
 B000A1ADUG  Tiny Sterling Silver Skull Stud Earrings 9/16 inch ||	  Very Pleased  First of all, the order arrived two days earlier than estimated. Secondly, the picture doesn't do these earrings justice. These earrings are simply awesome and the detail is excellent. We are very pleased. <end>
 B000A1BJV8  Tiny Sterling Silver Feather Stud Earrings 5/8 inch ||	  Basic silver feather earrings  Nothing truley special about these earrings. You get what you pay for which are some sterling silver earrings in the shape of feathers. <end>  Good deal  These were just a mite smaller then I anticipated, but they were high quality, arrived on time, and I was happy with my purchase. <end>  So close to the real thing...  The quality of the earring is superb. It is a very life-like depiction of a real feather, albeit in a minature form. The feather can be rotated so that you can wear it pointed up, to the side or down. If you are considering these, just keep in mind the size and compare the mm to a similar earring you already own. They are smaller than they appear in the picture, but still NOT tiny for stud earrings. Given their quality and price point, their size is more than generous. Go ahead and order right now. You will be happy you did! <end>
 B000A1BK0I  Tiny Sterling Silver Fairy Stud Earrings 13/16 inch ||	  adorable  )  light, intricate, and very cute! They came very quickly, and the price was very fair!

 B000A1BLX4  Tiny Sterling Silver Skull Stud Earrings 13/16 inch ||	  Perfectly Awesome  When I first saw them I thought they were the best earrings in the world. Since I'm sorta into all that gothic stuff they were sorta perfect for me. Spiders are so cool and skulls totally rock, so they are AWESOME. Everyone should get a pair. They are the perfect accessory. <end>
 B000A1BLXO  Sterling Silver Peace Sign Earrings 5/16 inch, 5/16 inch(8 mm) ||	  Daughter-approved  I bought these for my daughter for her 10th birthday. She really likes them and I think they are high-quality, she's been wearing them for a few months now with no problems. They are very lightweight. <end>  Nice earrings, shipping, not so much.  These are a very nice little pair of silver peace sign earrings. I purchased them a few days ago along with another pair of earrings, and while both pairs are small, having them sent in the same box, in the same envelope, but having to pay shipping on both as separate items I feel is a bit much, so be warned. The size is nice, about the size of a pinky fingernail, and I am not allergic to them, even better ! So, four stars out of five, the knockoff being the slightly expensive shipping. I will still get things, as there's some WL items yet, but now I'm more the wiser.Sabby, combine shipping if you're going to combine packaging. <end>  Super cute  I love the way these earrings look on me. I have gotten a lot of compliments since wearing them. They do not irritate my ears. <end>  Please with this purchase  I am quite pleased with this purchase. The shipping was done in a timely manner. I would order from this vendor again. <end>  Love these earrings!  These are so adorable and so cheap! I absolutely loveee them! The shipping was so quick also. I live in CT so I figured it would take a while, but it only took a few days! <end>  Thank you  I bought these for my 15 year old daughter and she loved them. They are shiney and small which is just what she wanted. She likes to express herself(the peace sign part) but she also likes to shine but in an understated way (shiny and small). She wears them all the time. <end>  PEACE EARRINGS  These earrings are absolutely adorable. My 17 year old daughter wears them all of the time. She loves the rhinestones. Makes them very unique. <end>  Partially pleased  These earrings are very cute, however they are not super high quality. I feel like I will break them pulling the back off the earring. <end>  don't understand why it is one of the most popular ones from Sabrina Silver  it's a pair of okay earrings. not very impressive. the sign is significant, but it doesn't look very very nice. just very normal. <end>  Meh..  They arrived fast and were cute. But were small, and didn't seem like sterling at all. <end>  Loved them  I absolutely love the earrings. I wanted them small......and that's exactly what I got. <end>  You get what you pay for...  I bought these for my husband for Christmas...he really liked them (I was a bit disappointed in the size, but that was my fault for not paying attention when I ordered)However...day after Christmas the post came of one of them. Good thing my man's only got one piercing!Tiny Sterling Silver Peace Sign Stud Earrings <end>  EARINGS  I purchaced 2 pairs of the same earings for my 2 daughters to give to them as gifts. I was disapointed that both earings game in ONE gift box. How hard would it had been to give me TWO gift boxes for TWO sets of earings? <end>  An eaiser way to bring peace!  Throughout history there have been great men and women who have fought for and died for peace. Look at what happened in the end to Gandhi and MLK. Look at the lives they lived, and while they accomplished so very much, look how few follow in their footsteps, and understandably  it's a tough way to live and die. Now you can bring peace without dying!!! Wear these earrings and you will be bringer of peace too, if Jesus had worn these instead of bringing a sword "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth  I came not to send peace, but a sword." Mt.10 34 he could have perhaps brough even more peace instead of years of war based upon religion and perhaps he wouldn't have gotten himself killed, poor dude. Anyway, great earrings, and lighter to carry than a sword. Makes me want to pierce my ears. <end>  S.S. peace sign earrings  If you're looking for a great pair of peace sign earrings look no further.These earrings are just perfect. The craftsman ship and the size are outstanding. I wear them all the time. Even when I sleep. You don't even know they are there. I have looked at other earring like these but I choose these and I'm very glad I did. Thank you.Peace to you and yours.Small Sterling Silver Peace Sign Earrings <end>  sterling silver peace sign studs  These are great little earrings. Modest, neat. The backings fit snugly, so the sign stays in place. A charmingly appropriate statement. <end>  So cute!  Thanks so much! Super fast ship and they are adorable! Good quality silver and perfect size small studs. <end>  Support our Soldiers  Love these earrings! perfect size and a great conversation piece. so far they have not tarnished and have not irritated my ears. Shipping was amazingly fast!  ) <end>  It's perfect!  Thanks guys it was just what my girl wanted! Your service was FAST! The product was EXCELLENT!Thank you again, you just made another Happy Customer <end>  Perfect peace earrings  My daughter (18 yrs old) was looking for this type of earring the whole summer of 2008. Of course we never thought of going on-line. Well, I finally went on-line to look for the perfect Chanukah gift. She loves them. They are the perfect size and the perfect thickness. Not to chunky. She loves them. <end>  worth the price  Overall a good pair of earrings. My only complaint is that the backing was too large and would slip out from the earring. I bought a new pair of backings and thats taken care of the problem. <end>  jewelry  The earrings arrived very quickly and they look better in-person than they did in the photo. They were a great deal. I'd definitely order from this site sgain. <end>  no problems  I bought this product for resale in my store. I am most satisfied with the product, the shipping and the whole transaction. <end>  Product great, customer service terrible  I have ordered several different items from sabrina silver, and the very last thing was damaged when it arrived. I emailed customer service to get it replaced, and I wasn't treated well. The representative was RUDE and NOT HELPFUL. The item was NOT replaced.Although this seller has great items to offer, I wouldn't risk ordering damaged material and then not recieving any helpful service. <end>

From a distance they look more like a flower than a group of skulls. <end>
 B000A1EK5K  Tiny Sterling Silver Knot Stud Earrings 3/16 inch ||	  Nice. Got them as a male, but perhaps a little feminine.  Comfortable, look nice, but after awhile I decided they are definitely made for girls. Especially since I saw one wearing the same pair. Buy accordingly. <end>  Perfect Knots!  I love my silver knot stud earrings! I wear one in a second hole in my ear and gave the other to the bestie. They are low maintenance. I've worn my for months and have had no issues. Great quality. <end>  Color wears off  I highly suspect that this is not sterling silver bc the color changed! It turned into rusty kind of color and became dull looking.This is not right because all of other sterling silver earring remain silver and shining even exposed to humidity (they are all in my bathroom). <end>  love  These look better than I thought it did from the picture.I wear these all day, every day. Love them. <end>  Tiny  I'm sure these would be beautiful if you could actually see them. They're seriously the size of my nose ring. Which may be good for some... But not me  ) <end>  Lovely  I've been searching for a pair of simple yet unique studs and these earrings are both. They are smaller but big enough to notice. Shiney and comfortable on the ear. Definitely worth the 10 bucks pluse S&H. <end>  Cute and subtle  These earrings are a great alternative to plain studs. Well crafted and hypoallergenic-didn't make my ears itch at all! They are very tiny but give a nice bit of shine. <end>  beautiful, simple design  These earrings shipped right away, and I got them just a days after purchasing them. The design is a great alternative to a simple silver ball. They are perfect for wearing in my second hole! I would definitely recommend this product and this seller! <end>  Not as pictured!!!!  Bought these to replace a pair that look exactly like the product picture... they however do not look like that. They have an extremely plain silver look - no dark antique look between the threads and between the bands. Look at some of the other knot earrings on Amazon - that's what they look like - plain bright silver. Bought these because I thought they were different  ( <end>  you get what you pay for  These earrings were very inexpensive. They are quite small & light but they were just what I wanted. It would be nice if they were a bit heavier but they are fine considering their cost. Too bad it costs a ridiculous amount to ship them. <end>  Very small and dull  I bought these mainly for the backs, and with the hope they would be of high enough quality for my second hole. The backs are great; the earrings themselves are dull and cheap looking. Buyer beware; I would never wear them out, nor consider them as giftable. The company (Sabrina Silver) was a pleasure to do business with  timely delivery, secure packaging. <end>  Are You An Adult Looking for Small Studs? Look No Further!!  Are you thinking that you cannot get quality earrings for this price ... especially ones appropriate for an adult? You will be pleasantly surprised when you purchase these earrings!I am a grandmother who has had trouble finding small studs for my second pair of holes that don't look like they're made for a child and have posts that are long enough.I ordered several pair from Sabrina Silver. I like ALL of them, but these are my favorite! I really like the way they look, and they're extremely comfortable. They're a perfect size for your second holes and their posts are a nice long length.They arrived very quickly ... faster than I had anticipated.I highly recommend them ... and Sabrina Silver! <end>  Tiny & Pretty  I love these earrings. They are just the right size and are understated but pretty. They are of good quality, too, and very detailed as well. It's hard to find something small, but different & unique. Nice alternative to a plain silver ball. <end>  I love em!  I absolutely love these earrings! Very cute, trendy and simple. They're the perfect size and are of great quality. <end>  pretty but not stirdy  the earrings look exactly the way the picture suggests, but i made the mistake of wearing the earrings to sleep and the knots come apart. they are a day-wear item only. when i buy stud earrings, i want to be able to sleep, work, play, and shower with them in. the antiquing (black stuff) to make the details of the knots look good also bleeds out of the earrings. they are tiny, they are knots, but be careful with them or they will come undone. <end>  Very happy with it.  I bought this for my wife. This stud earring looks both pretty and high quality. My wife is very happy with it. <end>  Very nice earrings!  These are very nice earrings. I have smaller ears, so they were a bit large for my second hole, but they look fantastic in the bottom hole. It's a cute spin on the basic stud. <end>  I LOVE them!  they are just perfect. the perfect look, size and price. i wear them in a second piercing and wear big silver hoops in the other. <end>  SO CUTE!!!!  I love my earings they are so cute and the perfect size for my ears, no complaints what so ever. <end>  Cute!  I love these, I was hesitating about size not because I thought they would be small but because I thought they would actually be too big as second earrings. I recently got a second hole pierced and I was wondering what to get in order to complement my swirly earrings and these guys do the trick. They aren't small so I don't know what people are talking about, but they aren't huge either. I never take them off; I go to the beach with them, shower and sleep with them and they don't bother me at all. Wouldn't hesitate to buy them again! <end>  Beautiful!  These earrings are so pretty and so dainty. They came beautifully packaged and my eight year old grand daughter just loved them. <end>

 B000A1EVMM  Sterling Silver and Peridot Children's Cross Pendant, 14" ||	  Childrens Cross Pendant  Nice pendant for kids, the description of this item should specify the size of the pendant since its very small. I would recommend it to anyone. <end>
 B000A1IA56  Sterling Silver CZ Dragonfly Anklet ||	  silver anklet  I've never purchased anything from this company before, but I am VERY happy with the quality of the product. I purchased it for my 30 yr. old daughter as a Christmas gift, and she hasn't taken it off since! <end>
 B000A26MUA  Toe Ring - 14kt Gold Fancy Twist ||	  Gold Fancy Twist Toe Ring  Very thin and light, comfortable and a good price for the quality that you get.

My ring sparkles so much that you just can't miss it! It really makes me happy with how fast my ring arrived. I have not taken it off since I have gotten! <end>  indifference  im not really sure about this ring.... i bought it as a christmas gift for my sister... the pictures make the ring look alot better than it looks in person, the ring was a bit cheaply made but not terrably so i dont think the price was quite right for the quality... i would pay 10 bucks max for a similar ring again <end>  Blue Topaz Ring for Daughter  This blue topaz ring is as described on the site, better than picture. Perfect for a young teenage daughter for Christmas. Shipping was quick as well. <end>  great company to do business with  I was very satisfy, with this product. The ring look the as it was shown online. I got it a couple of days later which I appreciate. kudos for that. <end>  great little ring  This is a cute little ring either to wear alone or even as a stacking ring. Color is very pretty, and the silver seems of good quality. Can't beat for the price. <end>  blue topaz ring  beautiful ring, sadly the firend i bought it for doesnt wear it  (warning  size runs big!!!!! <end>  Very nice!!  The color of the stones are very bright and blue... Its a very nice ring! <end>  Sparkle  This little beauty has fire and sparkle. Lovely blue color, bright pure setting. Absolutely love this ring. Nice size to wear alone or stacked with other rings. <end>  Beautiful  This ring was absolutely beautiful in person. I was so happy with the fast shipping. All around it was a great buy! <end>  Great product and service  The ring I ordered came in all sizes so selection was great from the get go and the prices are very reasonable. My girlfriend loved her ring and they shipped my order right away and even put it in a nice little box which made for a great gift as it was seemingly ready to be given for Christmas. All around a great experience and I hope to do more business in the future. A+ <end>  Pleasantly Surprised!  Rhodium .925 Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Cubic Zirconia Ring Eternity BandI must say... I really like this ring! I have only had it a day, so I can't tell you how well it holds up, but it is a very pretty ring! The stones actually look a little darker in person than they do in the picture (of course, computer screens vary) but I really love the color, which is a couple of shades lighter than a royal blue. The ring sparkles nicely, and has a good fit. Very comfortable...Gem Avenue shipped the item quickly, and I actually got the ring within 3 business days using only the basic shipping method! I will definitely purchase from them again! Good buy! <end>  Product for the Price  Well, the saying is, you get what you pay for. I think this is worth the price.The stones are bluer in the picture, and seem to have faded a little (or maybe it's my imagination), but they are very sparkly and pretty.The size I ordered was 5, and it came in about 5.5 or 5.75, which sucks, but I've worked it out. (I wear it with another ring on the finger I ordered it for.)The band seems a little wavy, like, uneven...it doesn't sit flat on a table, but my finger is wearing it, not a table!I'd give it five stars but for the sizing problem, which really could be a problem. Otherwise, it's a good ring for the price! <end>  Excellent  I love how this ring sparkles!  )It's really affordable and arrived faster than the estimated time!The only issue was the fitting.I tried with the sizing chart over and over again and I still ended up with a bigger size.So, that was really frustrating for me, especially since you can't rezie the rings.But, it's pretty and sparkly nonetheless  ) <end>
 B000A2LYF8  14K Yellow Gold Diamond Solitaire Cross Pendant ||	  Solid value  I purchased this item as a gift, and was greatly relieved when I opened the package to find a substantial product. As we have 'sweater season' I had been worried that the physical strength would not stand up to a cable-knit sweater. This is quite strong, and will not bend easily. The loop on the back will accept a 1.5mm chain, or a 1.8mm if it has small looped links. Elegantly casual. <end>
 B000A2V4X0  Silver Tone Link Charm Bracelet with Red Crystal Winged Fairy ||	  Think stainless steel.  I bought this fairy bracelet because my niece loves Tinkerbell. I loved the fact that the fairy has a kind of stone on the wings. So I bought one of each, a fairy with red wings, green, blue, well you get the idea. I regret buying them because the actual bracelet feels and looks like stainless steel instead of having a silver look. It reminds me of something that you can buy at a hardware store. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Bottom line- cute concept but poorly made. <end>  Was just Ok  I have to agree with the other reviewer. Overall, it was cute, but the bracelet felt cheap. I've bought nicer charm bracelets at Walmart for the same price. My 9 yr old daughter loves it though. <end>
 B000A3259Q  Genuine Tanzanite and 10K Yellow Gold Band Ring Size 7 ||	  Tanzanite Band Ring  I was sorry to find it looked cheap. The gold wasn't a nice color, the gem stones much smaller than I expected. I sent it back. <end>  Dainty & very pleasant to the eye  I purchased this ring during an auction & got it around $36. When I got it I was really surprised that it was so cute since I wear mostly small things & fell in love with it right away. I wore it when I was getting my gall bladder removed & the one tech said that she loved it, that it was really dainty. It changes colors-blue in the sunlight & purple in ultraviolet lighting. Nice little ring. <end>
 B000A32RAI  Sterling Silver "Fly" Pendant, 18" ||	  Awesome!  This little necklace is worth the money.It has weight to it and a great size.Have gotten lots of compliments on it!Go for it! You will like it! <end>  Sterling Silver "Fly" Pendant  Really cute and adorable but the actual pendent is so tiny it's hard to see what it is. <end>
 B000A32RLW  Sterling Silver and Leather Message Bead Necklace, 17" ||	  Buyer Beward  Though I still like this necklace, I was a bit disappointed upon receiving it. It looked much larger in the picture, with longer cord and the stones looked larger. Given its actual size, I don't think it was worth the price. <end>
 B000A3TCYW  Sterling Silver Italian Snake Chain Necklaces & Bracelets medium thick 2mm wide Nickel Free, Sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Nice looking but....  The silver necklace looks very nice and sturdy so I got it for my husband to wear a Celtic cross on. The first time he took it off over his head it broke at the clasp. Not very happy. <end>
 B000A3UN4A  Sterling Silver Italian Snake Chain Necklaces & Bracelets thin 1mm wide Nickel Free, Sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Wonderful value ...  This is a lovely small-ish chain. The description says it's "very thin," but it has some weight to it, certainly enough to handle some of my larger pendants. It's a higher-quality snake chain, very fluid, and a great compliment to my nicer silver pendants.I'm planning to purchase a couple more of these in different lengths. They're really very nice, and the shipping was fast and reasonably priced. <end>  sterling necklace  this is the most beautiful necklace. It is smooth and round feels great on. Love it with my different pendants. <end>  Excellent Value  Very good chain for the price - it's lovely - but your hair WILL get caught up in it! <end>  Great Product - Excellent Price!!!  I love my snake chain. I wear it 6 days out of the week. It was the lowest price online - even cheaper than ebay!!! I received it quickly as well. I highly recommend this seller. Great product at an excellent price! I will shop again! <end>  Happy with this product!  Very happy and planning on ordering MANY more!Michellewww.keepsakerosaries.com <end>
 B000A3WXDY  Sterling Silver Italian Snake Chain Necklaces & Bracelets Heavy 2.5mm Nickel Free, Sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Sabrina Silver ROCKS!!  Excellent product, price and service. I've made multiple purchases from Sabrina and am perfectly satisfied. I wouldn't hesitate to transact again. Thanks Sabrina! <end>  pandora silver bracelet  Item is superior to others I have seen and was promptly received. I will go back to them for future items <end>  Sterling Silver 2.5 mm Snake Chain Bracelet  Quick response and delivery. Beautiful bracelets, I purchased 2 to give as gifts. Great buy. <end>  Great bracelent  I love this bracelet, it is real sterling silver, I previously purchased an imposter that claimed to be silver and it wasn't.

 B000A3Z6BA  Sterling Silver Italian Snake Chain Necklaces & Bracelets medium thick 2mm wide Nickel Free, Sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Nice looking but....

 B000A42DKG  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Round Shaped Clear Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Twin 4mm Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Pretty ring  When I saw this ring online, I was looking for something in particular and thought this would work with a set I was creating. Even though it didn't work out for what I wanted, I ended up keeping it because it was so pretty. It's very realistic and withstands everyday wear.The craftsmanship could be a little better (hence 3 stars) only because there's no polished finish in the middle where the two bands cross over each other. But I think that adds to its "custom" uniqueness.I'd recommend this ring, especially now during graduation season. <end>  love it!  i love this ring its gorgeous and i can wear it everywhere and with anything....it doesnt catch on the pockets of my jeans and i like that a whole lot!....i missed wearing the ring my ex gave me so i wanted a new one and this is just fantastic!! <end>  not recommended  i feel the pic online is pretty nice, so i placed the order. but when i got it this morning, i was so disappointed that it looks so harsh even not wearing it. You can tell it's not in fine quality, maybe that's for its low price, but the main thing is this ring is not good for you if your finger is relative thin. And it's not that expensive, makes me not willing to return it, kinda waste of money. <end>  Elegant and understated  I have ordered may rigs from amazon and I finally wanted somethig simple and not gaudy. I saw this and thought it was perfect because it isnt just a simple plai band or a band covered with gems, its the best of both worlds. I received it today and I must say it is beautiful. Its dainty, not too thick, and it is so comfortable. it has just enough sparkle to garner a second peek from passerbys and I can't stop smiling whe I look at it. This is the perfect wedding band for me. Just enough design but still elegant. <end>  Cute Ring  I wasn't extremely impressed when I received this product, but then again it was inexpensive. The band with the cz looks good but the other silver band had rough edges and I just didnt like it. I would recommend it for a teenager or youth. I will say it was very cute for the price. Great design. <end>  What a Gem!!!  I absolutely love this ring. I love the design. The cost was perfect and I already received several compliments. It doesnt look "cheap" at all. <end>  Much nicer than I thought!  When I first received this ring, I was like "ok, it's nice" but the more I wear it, the more I like it. It's a better quality than I had first noticed too. Definitely worth the purchase. <end>  This is very beautiful for what are plans are for.  This is a promise ring bought for my daughter who is pregnant and due in May. The father of the baby and I thought it would be cute to make a onesie that said my daddy promises to always be there for me and you and this is a token of his promise attached by a little blue ribbon for her to untie. The funny thing was she thought he would buy her a promise ring for valentine's day. Can't wait until their son is born to see her reaction. <end>  pretty but...  I love silver, and CZ but I thought they'd be a bit shinier! Wear it everyday though so it must not be too bad eh? <end>  Stunning ring for a STUNNING price.  Beautiful ring, perfect for everyday wear. The stones are small but the ring is adorable. LOVE IT! <end>  ring  Its a nice ring. A bit odd shaped, takes a minute to get use to and the diamonds are smaller than they appear, but good for the price. <end>  So classic!  This ring is simple, yet elegant. A classic that can be worn with dressy clothes and your casual outfits. A must for all jewelry lovers! <end>  Cheap  This ring starts out looking good, but you can't fake quality. This is inexpensive and looks it, quickly. I am still looking for a wedding band replacement. <end>  Perfect  I didn't have any problem with this it item. The box had the correct size and I received the item ontime <end>  charming ring  I love this ring, simple, but pretty. It was just as described & the sizing was accurate. It's a cute little ring with a little bit of bling! <end>  Cosmetic  When I received the ring I was so happy! It came and the box was beautiful. The shine on the ring was excellent. But if you are one of those people who never take off your jewelry then this is not the ring for you. Within two weeks the ring had already started to discolor. The rusty tinge made it look so fake! Definately not good. I wish I could get my money back! <end>  Wrong size???  This ring is very nice; I like the looks of it. The only problem is that I bought this ring to wear in place of my wedding ring toward the end of my pregnancy. I ordered it a full size larger so I was sure it would fit. When it arrived, I couldnt even get it on my finger. When you hold it up to my wedding ring, they look to be the same size. The box it came in gave no indication as to which size was sent. So, they either sent the wrong size, or they run small somehow. I guess it will be worn after the birth of my son instead of now. <end>  cz twin band  the ring arrived on time, in a cute gift box. The silver appears to be high quality, it is very very shiny. The cz stones are believable as diamonds. i bought this as a gift for my sister and I know she will love it. The price is just to die for. Overall, no complaints. I recommend this adorable ring because it is perfect for the middle finger or right hand ring finger- or any finger really. <end>  Cute Ring  I wear this ring a lot because it isn't too flashy to overwhelm my wedding ring or look funny with my casual clothing style but it definitely isn't expensive looking. The CZs have very little sparkle to them at all. You would never confuse it with a real ring. Nice costume piece for everyday, though. <end>  CZ are sooooo small  The ring looks pretty different from the picture online.CZ stones are really small.Although it's ok for its price, I still feel a little deceived. <end>  could be better  the ring is beautiful but one of the stones fell out the second day i had it. i still wear it occasionally, but have to turn it a certain way so it doesnt show. ok for the price, but stones could be set better. <end>  SS CZ Twin Band Ring  I ordered four rings at the same time from Gem Avenue, they were delivered quickly and I was impressed with each one. This ring however has garnished me with the most compliments. What a beautiful ring, and for the price -- it's an amazing deal!The ring is a little wide, so I wear it on my pointer finger, but it always catches peoples attention! The little gift boxes the rings come in are darling!This product is a great value! <end>  Okay ring!!  For the price this ring is okay. I was not blown away at how pretty it is like I have been with some of the others that I paid the same amount for! From a distance, it is BEAUTIFUL, just don't let no one see it up close!! <end>  Beautiful ring  This ring is even better in person. You can dress it us or dress it down and it looks great!! I highly recommend it.After having it for a about a year, it has gotten pretty dull, even with cleaning. If aren't looking for something that will last forever, this is a great ring for the value. <end>  Excellent!  This ring is absolutely beautiful! The pics don't do it justice. I have worn it everyday since it was delivered and I completely love the way it looks. The only downfall is that it didn't come in 1/2 sizes. I wanted to wear it on my right hand, but it was just a bit too small, so I have to wear it on the left. Otherwise, I am more than satisfied with this purchase! <end>  Loved It!  I love this ring! I've had it only 2 days but it looks sooo real and I've already gotten a few compliments on it! Defidently worth the couple of bucks they wanted! Shipping was fast and they come in adorable little heart shaped boxes! <end>  Love The Ring  Wife simply loves the ring. For the money the price was right. It looks real and the compliments I receive are a definite plus. It doesn't look cheap at all.Thanks. <end>  pretty ring  This is a pretty ring. The only thing I didn't like about it was how wide the band was. I like how the front of the ring looks real. <end>  Keeping promise doesn't get any better than this...  My wife absolutely adore's this gift. I highly recommend if you are giving this to a special loved one. It doesn't look cheap at all, for the price, it will never replace a pure expensive metal like gold or silver but it does look very authentic. <end>  Great ring for cheap price  I totally surprised my girlfriend with this ring, but it had a flip-side since she thought I'm proposing to her!! I wanted this one to be just a sign of our commitment and not ruin the "right" moment with a nice ring.. so there you have it, I guess you can use this one to pass "the moment" expectations as well. <end>  love it!!  Beautiful ring, great quality and a good price. Looks good with everything. Love everything about it. <end>
 B000A46T6A  Sterling Silver Hammered-Style Ring, Sizes 7-12 ||	  Disappointed  The ring sizes run much smaller than the usual and the ring is so wide that you can't close your hand when it is on. Returning the item was even more difficult. While I returned it within one week of purchase, it took 7 weeks and a complaint filed with Amazon to get my refund. If you do purchase from this seller & ultimately have to return something be very sure you get a tracking number or receipt confirmation. Without that I would still be waiting for my money. <end>
 B000A6VFWQ  Faberge Style EGGS ||	  product surpassed expectations  The quality of the stone was better than I expected when held up to light, and it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. <end>
 B000A6WDP4  Red Sox belly button ring ||	  Red Sox belly button ring  The item was bought as a gift for my son's girlfriend. It appeared to be of good quality and was reasonably priced as well. She loved it so all were happy! <end>  customer service 5 stars  Excellent shipping, this product took only a couple of days, just in time for Christmas. The product looks just like the picture, thank you for the wonderful customer service. <end>
 B000A776RS  Sterling Silver Pave Cubic Zirconia Heart Anklet ||	  A little disappointed  Received this anklet very quickly and liked how it looked but a few hrs after wearing it for the first time, the clasp came apart so i will need to use some pliers to open the ring and reattach it. <end>
 B000A78KMI  Wine Bottles Cufflink by Umo Lorenzo - Silver Metal ||	  really fun 'links"  These are the Best cufflinks !

 B000A7BJBC  Past Present and Future 3 Stone Princess CZ Anniversary Ring ||	  Beautiful Ring  Just received this ring in the mail. I love, love, LOVE IT!!!!

We are wowed and very pleased. Thank you! <end>
 B000A845GM  Hippie Style Bohemian 18" to 20" Suede Necklace with Huge Faux Amber Stone Pendant ||	  Quality Not so great, but it is pretty  My necklace broke upon putting it on. and eventually the rest went with it. I don't recomend this product. but it is beautiful! <end>  Pretty, Poor Quality  When I got this I was amazed at the speed of the shipping and beauty of the item. It truly is amazing  D My only concern is it broke the second day. When I got it, there was a hole in the pendant and the string is made of weak leatherishness. But if your gentle, this is definitely a necklace you want to buy. I'm not upset that it broke, because it's so beautiful to being with.  D <end>  Many compliments!  I just got this necklace and have worn it twice. Both times, I received many compliments. The previous poster didn't like hers, but it does have the boho look I am after and is very casual. I will wear mine often! <end>  My Favorite  Man... for just a couple of bucks this is really a cool Necklace. I've always wanted one just like this, so I bought two of them... Farm Up, Man... <end>  Lovely  My boyfriend just got me this necklace and I love it! Very beautiful piece of jewelry. I've gotten a lot of comments on it in just a few days!  ) Very happy. <end>  Hippie style Bohemian pendant with suade necklace  This arrived quickly and was packaged nicely and looks exactly as it is pictured. The colors inside are beautiful and it is a suade necklace as it claimed. The stones are pretty and the color is rich. This is one of the best values I found that day while shopping and I'll wear this one this Fall. It's a great buy for the money, very pretty. Even my husband likes it and he rarely likes anything like this. <end>  Wonderful  I bought two of these faux amber necklaces and they are quite well made. The pendant is almost 2 inches in length it does look larger in the photograph but by being smaller it looks more realistic. It is actually a good weight not to heavy not to light it looks as if some effort has been put into the making of it. I think it is a good purchase for the price because it does not look cheap or tacky. <end>  Cool Necklace  I like the unique style of this necklace, and received compliments on it when I wore it to work. The price is reasonable for the type of necklace having such unique beads. <end>  Poor Craftsmanship!  I orginally purchased this for myself when it was $10. As soon as I received it I went to put it on and it broke right away. I was very disappointed so my boyfriend purchased another one for me for $10. I went to put that one on and it broke as well. I was never able to wear the necklace even once. I do not recommend this product to anyone!!!!!! <end>  There are no words...  I couldn't believe how fake and cheap this item looked once I received it. The cord which looks black in the picture is also brown, and very flimsy. The item looks WAY better in the picture than it does in person. <end>  Frightening  Like nothing I've ever seen in nature or man-made. Very loud and rather like alava lamp stuck in mid-burp. If Ellen had a uglest jewelry contest this would be a good entry. Creepy. My reaction was -- they can't be serious?! <end>  Yeah great for a 12 year old  Price says it all. Maybe nice for a child 12 years or younger but not cute on an adult. <end>  Amazing!!!  Amazing necklace!! I bought it for myself and was amazed when it came in. I showed it to my husband and my friends and they could not believe that it only cost me 3.99. It goes with everything. Thank you so much!! <end>  Disappointed  Bought this for a gift. With the suede necklace, it looked nice. Then it arrived. To my surprise the Amber Stone was HUGE! I mean really large. Bigger than a dollar coin.The person claimed to like it, but I have my doubts. Never seen it worn. <end>  Cheap  Cheap plastic, broke instantly, price good, but you get what you pay for so don't bother. <end>  Nice  This product is surprisingly pretty. It's not the real thing, and has a tad fake quality to it, but I wear it with red tops and it really goes well. <end>  WOW!!!  I ordered this on the hopes that the necklace would live up to its picture and not live down to the negative reviews. I am so very happy that I went ahead and bought this for myself!!!!! I just love the colours in this necklace!! The length is perfect! I just wish there were a few more accent beads, but all in all it is lovely!! <end>  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT  THIS NECKLACE IS GORGEOUS, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT SO MUCH. THE LARGER STONE LOOKS EVEN MORE FABULOUS IN PERSON. ITS GOT SPECKS & DIFFERENT TONES OF OTHER COLORS SWIRLED INSIDE THE ORANGE YELLOW STONE. I EVEN SEE SPARKLES INSIDE AND FOR THE PRICE, THIS NECKLACE IS A TOTAL STEAL. IF YOUR EVEN THINKING ABOUT BUYING IT, BUY IT & SEE FOR YOURSELF. I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY, ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT!! <end>

 B000AA2TKE  Pewter Mini Dachshund Pin ||	  Diminutive Dachshund.  Just right as a collar pin, and could be used as a tie tack, for a dog fancier. It's a perfect rendering in miniature of the famous doggie that's 'Two dogs long, and half a dog high'! <end>  Very Mini Dachshund Pin  Very cute pin, but much smaller than I expected. Its tiny. It almost gets lost on clothes. With the cost of shipping, it is not worth the price. If it was cheaper or you find it in a store, than go for it. My mom who owns two Dachshunds did enjoy it though. <end>
 B000AA2VSY  Yellow Glow In The Dark Belly Button Ring ||	  Disappointed  This doesn't glow in the dark. I don't know if I got a defective one or what but it most definitely DOESN'T glow. <end>

 B000AAO0R4  Sterling Silver Cushion Hoop Earrings ||	  These are really quite nice.  I was looking for simple sterling silver hoops to pair with some flashier necklaces i have and these were perfect. The posts on the hoops are bigger than i expected but i had no problems getting them through my holes. They are hollow inside like the previous review said but they still have a heavy weight even for being hollow. Over all these are very nice earings for the price and quite elegant when paired with flashier pieces. <end>  Fashionable Hoop Earrings  These earrings are a great find. They are made of .925 sterling silver, which is the same quality of Tiffany's. The only downside is they are not solid. If you look inside the hoop, it is hollow. The earrings come in a blue velvet bag and gift box. Eve's Addiction also included a pair of CZ princess cut earrings since my purchase was more than $75 and I received free shipping. For $28, I am happy with my purchase! <end>
 B000AAP7X0  Platinum Fleur-De-Lis Cross Pendant ||	  Nice Pendant  I've ordered this pendant as I always wished to have some Platinum Jewelry at home. The packaged arrived after almost a month, as it was stopped at Spanish customs. Away from that, the package was nice, invoice was shipped with it, and the overall presentation of the item was fair enough for me. Once opened, the pendant looked as impressive as I expected, colour was nice, very bright with direct light on it, so if you have already purchased a chain for it, make sure it also shines enough.Related with built quality, details are very well finished, borders are fine and overall it will fit your expectations (At least mine ones).Hope this helps.Regards <end>
 B000AATMPY  Amazon.com  Brighton Deco Lace Bracelet  Clothing ||	  Deco Lace Bracelet  I love this bracelet and the design.

High quality Brighton jewelry that looks expensive but is really reasonable. <end>
 B000AHICXA  Platinum Beaded Necklace, 18" ||	  Poor Packaging, limited quality.  Yes, I know at 150 bucks you need to keep your expectations low for anything you may buy in the jewelry area. This thing arrived in a little blue/pouch bag with a small presentation type box included. Any jeweler with half a brain knows that you dont just throw any neckless in a bag and ship it out. It arrived a royal tangled knotted up mess. I worked at trying to get it apart for a few minutes but finally gave up. A blown Christmas present. Thanks Amazon. From what I could see of it, the quality is about what you would expect for the price. The clasp was thin-cheap-o along with the chain that held it all together. Once again, there are things you should NOT buy on the internet. Jewelery is one of them and Amazon should know better than letting the temporary Christmas help do the packaging not mention marketing of Christmas "specials".. <end>  Intricate design! Great value for money!  I love the design of this necklace, intricate yet low-key, very classy. A great investment!Any chain necklace, especially one this thin (something that can be made only with platinum), can get tangled up sometimes; hence, the packaging needs to be improved. <end>
 B000AHICXK  Platinum 1.1mm Wheat Chain Necklace, 18" ||	  Platinum Surprise  This is a beautiful chain. It hangs nicely, doesn't kink and goes well with the estate pendant it was purchase to go with. Only drawback is that the clasp is daintier than I would like. <end>
 B000AHW6KK  Sterling Silver 7mm Plain Bangle Bracelet 2.25 inch With Push button Clasp ||	  Delicate  This looked like a nice product, and it is, however it is a very delicate piece; delcate in that, the adjoining chain gets loose alot if you do a lot of activites which envolve your hands. It is perfect however for adding an engraving on it. I would say it's one of those things you wear for a special dinner or outing, not everyday. <end>  Bracelet  Not bad but the clasp comes loose to easy. I recommend buying a higher quality product. <end>
 B000ALERH6  Seattle Seahawks belly button ring ||	  Seahawks Belly Button Ring  I love this Seahawks belly button ring and was happy that it got to me so quickly. I do with that the metal on the Seahawks logo didn't infect my skin but it is very cute to wear for only a short period of time. Now I have everything I need to be decked out for a Seahawks game! <end>
 B000ALMMF0  Sterling-silver yellow-gold onyx Black Hills Gold men's Eagle Ring ||	  Black Hills Gold Eagle  This ring brings compliment after compliment from all who see it. I had the ring resized and the jewler appraised it at twice the value I paid for it. A truely beautiful ring. <end>

 B000AMY29I  Sterling Silver Starfish Necklace ||	  A Beautiful Gift  I purchased this necklace with the 18 inch chain, as a gift and was very happy with the quality of the piece. I was slightly disappointed with the size as I thought it was going to be about a 1/2 inch larger in diameter, but it is still a lovely necklace and I was not at all reluctant to give it as the gift for which it was purchased. <end>  STAR  This was given as a gift to my girlfriend. She hasn't had a vacation in over 10yrs..has been to the beach in 20? i think...this was just a little teaser gift for her to look forward to the trip <end>
 B000AN1344  Sterling Silver Brilliant Cut Engagement Ring ||	  Turned my finger a different color!  I usually am a big fan of 925 sterling silver, and also a big fan of Eve's Addiction, but this piece of jewelry made my ring finger turn a green/grey color of where the band was on my finger. Terrible. But beautiful design, cheap 925 or certainly not 925 sterling silver! <end>
 B000ANKUFC  Garnet Fire Burst Silver Natural Seed Pearl Ring - Dahlia Vintage Collection ||	  I love my ring!  This is a very pretty ring. Got it for X-Mas it wears well. Looks vintage. I allways get lots of complments with this ring. <end>  Amazingly beautiful!  This ring is simply wonderful! It's stunningly beautiful, and when wearing it, I spend most of the time gazing at my finger -)The #1 purchase of the year! <end>  Very Pretty but doesn't hold up  I must say, I got this ring and was thrilled with it. It was my ideal ring, it was gorgeous, I got tons of compliments, hell, in a round about way I got a job because of it!That being said, this ring does not hold up well. Shortly after getting it the seed pearls started to crumble and fall off. At this point there are only 2 1/2 holding on. Also two of the garnets fell out of the settings, and the back of the band broke. The band broke first, and I didn't think much of it; its happened before to me, but when the stones started falling out I was very upset.This is a gorgeous piece of jewelry, but if you love it wear it sparingly or it wont last. Mine sits in my jewelry box because it no longer looks good enough to wear with the missing stones (not to mention the empty settings are sharp). <end>  Unique garnet and seed pearl ring  It is a unique garnet and seed pearl ring. It is very difficult to find. I saw similar pieces of jewelry in Austrian museum shops only. <end>  Beautiful, but defective (UPDATED)  I received this ring as a gift, and I absolutely loved it - until a few of the stones began to fall out after only a couple of weeks of wear. Have contacted customer service with Dahlia to see if I can get it repaired or replaced. Would gladly revise this to a full five stars if the item can be fixed or replaced because it was stunning until it began to lose stones.UPDATE  With wonderful customer service, Dahlia replaced the defective ring with a new one that is brighter and more beautiful than the first. It's completely free of defects. Highly recommend both this ring and the seller. Star rating changed from 3 to 5. <end>  bought it for myself  I bought this ring and i love it everyone wants to know where i got it very pretty ring u can wear it casual or dressed up i love it. <end>  Beautiful  Got this as a valentines day present for my wife and I have to say it is beautiful. Pictures don't do it justice. If your thinking about buying it do. You won't regret it <end>  garnet ring  This has been my favorite piece so far. Looks wonderful on my hand! I have received many compliments and would buy again. <end>  It is gorgeous!  This ring is more beautiful in person than the picture. It is now my favorite ring, as it sits low on the finger and doesn't catch on anything, and is stunning. <end>  Beautiful ring.  I love this ring. The vintage look to it. However I am sending it back because there is a pearl missing on one side of the ring. I will be getting another one, though. <end>  perfect  This ring was a christmas present for my wife. She always tells me I have bad taste and don't know how to shop for her. Well, She loved this ring and has been wearing it since. It is very pretty. I recommend this to everyone. You wont be disappointed. <end>  Really Pretty but Cheaply Made  I bought this ring about a month ago and have worn it 4 or 5 times. It's really beautiful, but one of the tiny pearls has already fallen out. When I got it out of the box, I expected it to be heavier than it was. It's very light weight and apparently not very well made. I'm bummed because it is a pretty ring, but definitely not worth the price, as it's already damaged. I'd say it's worth about $20 max. <end>  Exquisite!  This ring is absolutely beautiful. It is elegant and looks just like the picture. I love how it looks on and off the finger! Very good investment!!! <end>  Really beautiful  This ring is gorgeous. I've received many compliments on it. It has a low profile do it doesn't catch on things. It looks vintage and I just adore it. <end>  Very pretty  The garnet doesn't look the same in person; it is a shade or so lighter and looks, to me, more like an orange shade than deep red. But the ring is still very pretty. <end>  She LOVED it!  I got this for my fiance for a Valentine's Day gift. She absolutely loved it! I had to contact Dahlia directly for a small issue and they responded and corrected it ASAP. That is one awesom company! I will be buying the matching earrings for her! <end>  In love with this ring!  Received this today as a Christmas gift. It is even more beautiful in person. I am in love and plan to wear it as often as possible. <end>  A big hit with the wife!  Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. The ring was exactly as described and beautiful. The wife loves it and wears it as often as she can with various outfits. Will definitely be doing business with this vendor again! <end>
 B000ANMESI  Gemini Silver Natural Seed Pearl Ring, Natural (Size 5) - Dahlia Vintage Collection ||	  very disappointed!  I'm heartbroken over this ring  I received it as a Christmas present from my boyfriend, and less than 24 hours later one of the pearls has already fallen out! <end>  Beautiful ring  I'd had my eye on this ring for some time when I finally decided to order it. I am very glad that I did--it is beautiful, dainty, and classic. I think that, overall, it was a really good value for the price as well.I was surprised with how quickly I received it in the mail--the shipping was fast and I am satisfied with my whole experience. I love Dahlia's line of jewelry anyway, so I will definitely buy from them again in the future! <end>  Beautiful!  This ring is stunning! It is perfect as a Promise ring and birthday present. I am very happy with it! Also, the price is reasonable for what you get and the I received it within two days of ordering. <end>  Classic ring  Bought it as a gift, caused great impression. Looks classic and delicate. No flaws service, just click, wait two days, go to the mailbox, that's it. <end>  pearl ring  arrived in a timely manner and it was beautiful. Bought one for myself and for my sister <end>
 B000ANYO8G  Rhodium plated cylinder calendar cufflinks with presentation box. ||	  Cool, but a little unfinished  Very cool and unique. Definitely catch people's eyes. Reason for 4 stars is for 2 reasons. 1, the numbers, lines and days are not even. In other words, sometimes the lines match up nicely between all of the tumblers, other times they don't. They aren't engraved exactly. 2, the screw in the end that holds the tumblers together can come loose if you're not paying attention to it. I actually like to set the date on mine. And I notice if I turn it the wrong way I can loosen the screw and they get really loose. Tighten the screw too much and the tumblers are hard to turn.These things may only bother me because I am very detail oriented when it comes to these things. I recommend them and would buy them again at the price, but know these 2 things going in. <end>
 B000AO33YQ  Sterling Silver Greek Key Toe Ring ||	  Poor  I ordered this product as a gift for a bridesmaid in my wedding. The store sent me the wrong toe ring so I contacted them requesting that they correct the error. They told me they would send the correct ring immediately and never did. I contacted them numerous times thereafter and they did not respond again. I would not do business with this store ever again. <end>

 B000AOJ7NW  Italian Horn, Sterling Silver ,20" Stainless-steel Chains ||	  Good quality but too big  This horn is solid and made very well. It is made more for a man than a woman. It's large about 2 inches. I would recommend this item but not if you're looking for a small pendant. <end>  BEAUTIFUL & SOLID SILVER  I ordered this for of all people my daughter....she is half Italian (Me) and Half Irish (Mother). She saw someone wearing a gold Italian horn and commented on it. When I said its an Italian good luck piece. She stated she really wanted one to show that she was part Italian...of course I was Proud as a peacock so i looked for a "Silver" One I could give her as a gift. I saw this one and AT THE PRICE I couldn't resist ...I figured it might be hollow (I Definitely was looking for a solid one) So I decided to take a chance.....when I received it it was Big Beautiful & Solid!!! Its beautiful!!!! I liked it so much I ordered another for myself. This pendant is Definitely Keepsake quality...I wish the Baill was a little better but at this price I'm not complaining! THANKS GOLDFINGER!!!! You REALLY Came through and Shipping was FAST!!!! <end>
 B000AQK5E0  Earspiral Earrings CB271XSMN multicolor Niobium with 14K Gold-filled bead ||	  Poor Design  Loved the look of these earrings. They wouldn't stay in my ears and one fell out. I lost it. $30 down the drain and only had them on for about an hour before one fell out and got lost. <end>
 B000AQW1FQ  Reverse Tribal - belly button ring - Hinged Top for comfort ||	  reverse tribal belly ring  The Reverse Tribal belly button ring did not hang right. It tiped foreward and looked funky. I wore it at home and it broke off at the top. This belly button ring was a waist of money! <end>
 B000ARKU80  Miraculous Medal - M2513 ||	  Miraculous Medal  I shopped online extensively to purchase a miraculous medal in white gold for my daughter...this item was the very best price I could find...when I received the medal I was very pleased with the quality and beauty of it...my daughter loved it! Thanx, Amazon for a great online shopping experience! <end>  Miraculous Medal  This medal is beautiful, and small. It's perfect to buy for a man who doesn't generally wear jewelry. <end>
 B000ARQ7ZU  Sterling Silver CZ Dragonfly Ring ||	  Very cute ring!  This is a very nice ring, and very nice quality sterling. I have gotten several compliments already, and have only worn it once. <end>
 B000ARQ9T4  Sterling Silver Pearl and Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  Sterling Silver Pearl and Cubic Zirconia Ring  I like the ring, but the real color of the pearl is white, not peach as appears on the photo. You'd better change the photo to not confuse people. Thanks. <end>  Shiny and sparkly but ring size not accurate  I think this ring is just okay. The size 5 I ordered feels like a size 6. The side stones are sparkly, but feel scratchy. The pearl is button shaped, and white, not grayish as in the picture. It looks shinier than the picture. Too bad it can't be resized. The promotional discount and free shipping was a good deal at the time.However, should anyone choose to return the merchandise, you might not receive a full refund. This company will charge you for the shipping cost to you and from you! Also, should you give them a review and/or rating that is 3 star or lower, they might email you to get you to change it! <end>
 B000AS86TY  14K Yellow Gold 2.0MM DIAMOND CUT SOLID ROPE 20" NECKLACE ||	  Beautiful Gold  I recently purchased this necklace and I am very pleased. I got many compliments. My own mother asked to wear it for a wedding shower and she got compliments on it too. It shines best in natural sun light. You'll feel good wearing this and never grow bored of it. I anticipate putting it on before I leave the house. Part of why it shines so well is because of how clean the cuts on the little circles are (not sure what the correct term or word is). Augustina is an incredibly great company, and although they are big into pearls the necklaces are for both men and women. Buy this item for yourself or give it to someone as a gift(just imagine the expression on their face when you hand it over to them). Just make sure you know the thickness and length you want. <end>
 B000ASL83K  Southwestern Style Animal Track ( Raccoon, Moose, Mountain Lion, Coyote, Beaver, Gray Wolf and Bear ) Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 12, #11873 ||	  beautiful  This ring is just exactly as it's pictured, and simply gorgeous -- and Taos Trading's customer service  fantastic. Highly recommended. . . . <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I love this ring... I love wildlife especially wolves and to have their tracks in turquoise on a beautiful sterling silver ring is awesome. You can't go wrong with this one! <end>
 B000AV62XS  Genuine Garnet and Diamond 10K White Gold Ring Size 7 ||	  chipped garnet  The ring was nice and looked like picture but had a crack in one Garnet and another one had a large chip. <end>
 B000AV84J8  5-Stone Genuine Watery Light Blue Topaz 10K Yellow Gold Ring Size 7 ||	  Made of a poor material of who knows what  This ring got broken the first week I use it. It's a weak ring that is know not useful. I paid for nothing. The stone was clear, it did not have a blue color and it was not a blue topaz. <end>
 B000AV84JI  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Spin Worry Ring Sz 6.5(Sizes 4.5,5.5,6.5,7.5,9) ||	  Love this ring- but bit different from photo  Maybe this is standard for jewelry- but the ring is slightly different from the photo. Not quite as chiseled, and with some noticeable minor differences in the hands, heart, crown and in between. That being said, I love the one I got. <end>
 B000AXWB4K  HOT CELEBRITY CZ ENGAGEMENT RING ||	  Great Buy  This ring is beautiful. I've gotten compliments from the first day I wore it. It adds a look of class to any outfit. It makes you look like you've got a million bucks on your hand (and in your wallet)! You can't go wrong purchasing this item. <end>
 B000AXWVAE  14k White Gold Diamond Floating Heart Pendant (1/2ctw, H-I, I1) ||	  Beatiful, simple, clean  I presented my wife with two pendants to choose from for Christmas and she picked this even though it was half the carat weight of the other. It's beautifully made and proportioned. Not too flashy, not old fashioned but stylish, flexible and timeless. <end>  Love it!!!  I had been searching for a beautiful timeless heart for myself since long time ago until I "bumped into it" online at Amazon "supermarket". It's dazzling and I couldn't help falling in love with it at the first sight  O) I took the action immediately and I'm so happy I did. It's truly worth the time and price I paid. Now I'm carrying the special heart with me wherever I go... <end>  Very pretty. Good size diamonds.  Actual heart is not huge, maybe a bit over 1/2 inch. Diamonds look good and a good size. Nice and sparkly.Certainly worth the money, [...]I had it shipped to Australia and it arrived via singapore post with no problems. <end>  Awesome necklace  I purchased this for my wife, and she loves it. I did alot of research on options for a heart necklace before I purchased this necklace. Amazon sells one that's 1/4ctw and 1/2ctw. I selected this one (1/2ctw) because I felt it would look nicer, and it looks great. The diamonds are the right size, and so is the heart. In the light, it shines nicely. As far as the grade of the diamonds, due to their size, you really cannot see any issues with any of the diamonds.The only thing that Amazon should change would be that they should put a better clasp on the necklace. This version is a very basic clasp. Most other necklaces that my wife has have better clasps. <end>
 B000AXZE8K  14k White Gold Diamond Floating Heart Pendant (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I1 Clarity) ||	  Absolutely gorgeous!  My boyfriend gave this to me for our 6-month anniversary, and wow, is it gorgeous! The pendant is not too big, and not too small. It's just perfect. The necklace itself is a nice box-chain; not a flimsy chain that usually comes with jewelry pendants. Everything looks to be of very high-quality. And the diamonds, WOW. They are super sparkly. Sure, they may not be huge, but the cut and clarity are excellent; every stone sparkles greatly, and there is not a single cloudy stone; not even a little cloudy. Oh, and if you look closely, the stone at the bottom of the heart is bigger than the rest as well.  o) <end>  Beautiful & Classic  This is a beautiful, classic piece. My husband got mucho brownie points for this one. A good choice for anyone you want to show your love to! <end>  Beautiful  My husband got me this as a gift for valentines day. I just loved it.This chain would suit any occasion casual or formal. The chain is of right length, although thin. The chain is solid(not the kind you get with some pendants)so it looks good on your neck. The pendant is nicely designed and diamonds though small look sparkly.This would make a great gift for your special someone. <end>  Beautiful but smaller than expected  These diamonds are absolutely beautiful, honestly they are, but I was expecting a bit more of a WOW factor when I saw them for the price. The gift went over very well though. =) &lt;3 <end>  Great Gift!  My husband had purchased this as one of my gifts for Christmas. And I love it... it's the perfect size! I get compliments on it all the time. I haven't had any problems with it at all.It's a great buy  ) <end>  Brillisntisimo  I bought this, and changed my mind, so I intended to send it back-that was until I opened the box. This beautiful little floater is bright, shimmery, and I'm pretty good with my diamonds and the 4 c's.I would recommend this to anyone-one complaint, the chain could be far better for this item, however, it is a deal and gorgeous. The heart is about the size of a dime, but especially worn choker style, this is an eye catcher! <end>  Good little gift  The pendant is pretty but a little bit small. The diamonds all looks good. It is a good little gift for your girl friend to cheer her up. <end>  Diamonds are a girls best friend  Gave this to my girlfriend for our 2 year anniversary, she loved it... A little smaller then what i expected but it worked in my favor. It's nice and delicate, and not to gawdy. The diamonds glisten and shimmer and the rope chain is not to long... <end>  Incredible pendant!!  I have been looking at this pendant for over a month now. I finally decided to get it last week and I am so glad I did! The diamonds are exquisite! They are white, perfectly matched, and the sparkle is unreal. The size of the pendant is just right, slightly under an inch. It comes with a thin but sturdy white gold chain. I do wish the chain had a lobster claw clasp, but I really can't complain about this amazing deal. I have seen styles like this in stores go for $500. Thanks Amazon!! <end>
 B000AXZFIE  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver Toe Ring Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Basket Weaved ||	  Loved it  I love this toe ring I hardly take it off and have received many compliments. <end>  Poor Quality  This is a beautiful piece, but unfortunately this toe ring snapped on the third wearing. I am very disappointed with the quality. <end>
 B000AYJD0O  Children's Butterfly & Bee Bracelet (length  5") ||	  Very Cute!  My great grand mother gave me a bracelet like this when I was born, and I passed it on to my oldest daugher when she was born. Later when I had my second daughter, I didn't know what to do. I found this bracelet and it was perfect. It's not quite the same as the other one, but very similar. It looks so cute on her, and it grows with her. <end>
 B000AZ4BNM  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Bow Pendant with Pearl Drop ||	  CZ Bow Pendant with Pearl Drop  Such an elegant piece! I order a few of these for my bridesmaids and they adored them. Great product at a low price! <end>  I agree  I agree. I really wanted my wedding to be special, but this vendor needs to be more specific with her merchandise. The "Vera Wang" necklace, which I purchased was soooo disapointing! The pendant was way too small as well as the chain. It was terrible. I strongly recommend not to burchase from them. <end>  Don't get this just to match the earrings  I ended up returning this necklace. The pearl wasn't that pretty. It didn't match the earrings I had gotten to go with this necklace (they're from the same company). It was a weird shape, neither oval or round. The chain was really cheesy looking. The only reason I gave this necklace any stars was for the bow. Other than that, I didn't like anything else about this necklace. <end>

 B000B0Y3RK  Girls or Childs Studs - Square Princess-Cut Synthetic Pink Sapphire Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Great earrings for the price!  My 9-yr old daughter has an alergic reaction to all earrings except sterling silver. These are great earings for the price and are perfect for a young girl! <end>  Wonderful item!  I love my purchase. I chose to get them at Amazon.com rather than a store because of my great experiences with Amazon.com in the past. The earrings were a great price. Amazon.com emailed me when my order was placed AND when my item was shipped. I am very satisfied with my order and I plan to buy more from Amazon.com in the future! A+ <end>  Perfect earrings !  I got these for my little niece and they are perfect fora pink loving little girl; especially for the price. <end>
 B000B0ZNQK  Sterling Silver Fancy Victorian Style Cross Ring Size 7(Size 6,7,8,9) ||	  Pretty  This ring is very pretty and fits nicely, but the cross design is a bit smaller than I was expecting. <end>  Not exactly what I want  I don't recall when I bought this ring that there were two separate rings pictured. I only recall seeing the close up one with the thicker cross and then a customer image on a finger. Pictures 2 and 3 (which are actually the same as another reviewer noted) are NOT the same ring as the first one pictured. I really wanted what is pictured in the first one. The cross is thicker and much more noticeable. It's more solid and weighty looking. The ring I got is the second one pictured which has a much thinner cross and looks more dainty than weighty. Now, it's not an ugly or cheap ring... it's just not what I wanted. I wanted the thicker looking one. I'm a guitar player and wanted it to be seen from stage while I'm playing. The one I got just won't do that.If you want what's in the first picture, do not buy this ring. If you're OK with how the one in the second picture looks, go ahead and buy it. It fits true to size and is nice for what it is... it's just not what I expected and wanted. <end>  Two different rings....  I haven't even ordered this ring but i read the reviews for it. If you notice picture 1 and pictures 2/3 are two different rings. I was going to order the ring but it seems that the ring received is the 2nd/3rd ring which has a smaller cross design. <end>
 B000B11O30  Sterling Silver Mens Genuine Blue Lapis Ring Size 12(Sizes 10,11,12,13) ||	  Poor Quality  After recieving this ring, I noticed the ring was very thin and bends easy. Looks too cheap to wear. Very dissatisfied. <end>  Very Eye Catching  It looks exteremly good, I received many complemts on it. People said it looks like it worths more than $200!!!HOWEVER, it is very fragile and bents easly. Man I was really disappointed because of that. Secondly, usually if the gemstone is genuine, you get a certificate that says so, but hey.... it does'nt matter, it looks very real to me. <end>  Blue Lapis Ring  I am satisfied with the ring. Others have noticed and complimented the ring. For the price it seems a good purchase.Fred Freeman <end>  Fooled at first.  I purchased this product earlier this year. Initially, I was pleased with the craftmanship and overall product.About the third wearing, I noticed the lapis had become uneven (one side had sunk deeper into the setting) leaving the surrounding metal pertruding around nothing. By the end of the day the entire stone had settled deeper into the mount resulting in a ridge of metal above the now-disappearing stone.At first, I thought maybe I had bumped the stone and loosened it. Looking back, I am certain that wasn't the case. To correct the problem, I took the ring to a silversmith who evenly pushed the metal ridge down, around the stone. The appearance isn't the same.For a ring this size, and a stone this large, it is an almost weightless piece of jewelry. My other sterling pieces are much heavier than this piece. Reminds me of a tin ring I used to get from a penny machine at the bus station. <end>  Unexpectedly impressed!  The ring is wonderful! I didn't know if it would match up with the image on the webpage, but it is much more beautiful than the image depicts--and very masculine. I love it! <end>
 B000B12TWA  Sterling Silver Double Fleur De Lis Style Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,9) ||	  ring  the ring seems to be of good quality and not too heavy to wear. the ring size (9) is smaller than other rings I have in size 9. also thought the 'top side' of the ring looked bigger in the picture than it is. <end>
 B000B12U10  Sterling Silver Medieval Court Armor Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  ok but stylish ring  This unisex ring is a handsome looking ring, inexpensive, and unusual looking. It looks like a ring made more for the guys. It runs small when it comes to sizing. You should order twice the size of what you normally would wear. The seller is a good company, and did a size exchange for me for a $3 fee to cover their s&h. Other than the sizing, this ring is a cool ring when out clubbing, etc. <end>

 B000B5K2Q6  Olive Wood Rosary with Holy Water from the Jordan River - With Certificate of Authenticity (51 cm or 20") ||	  beautiful rosary  The rosary was very beautiful. Made a great gift to a friend. Shipping time was excellant. <end>  Don't bother!  I ordered this rosary, (a descision I made after many years of experiencing awful nightmares, and constantly feeling tormented by dark spirits.) I thought this would bring me comfort & serenity at night. Upon receiving this in the mail, I was very disappointed. The wood is flimsy, bracets are barely holding it together & the "holy water" looked like thick molasses! I spent the few extra bucks on this peice, mainly because of the holy water it claimed to have. When I received it, I could not even tell what the liquid substance in the capsule even was! I'll tell you one thing... It looked like liquified ear-wax, with a slight hueish tint of a color I can't even describe. If this was even water, it sure wasn't blessed! The cross itself was pretty but THAT IS ALL. If you want to purchase this item, don't count on handeling it at all unless you want to end up with broken peaces & an empty wallet. I am in no way shape or form a materialistic person, and there is no price I'd put on my lord Jesus, but I bought this peice expecting genuine quality that could represent my love for god for many many years to come.... And I am sad to say that what I purchased is nothing but a cheap neclase that I couldve easily made myself with items from a local craft store!! After realizing how flimsy and breakable this rosary was, there was no way I could hold this at night when I sleep.. So I hung it in on the rearview of my car for decoration. Some protection my $20 bought me!  -l Needless to say, the very next day, someone broke into my car, stole everything I had, and the rosary was broken into a million peices. Some sort of luck it gave me! Not only was this peice nothing like the picture & description, the faith I had that this would bring me comfort and protection diminished as it has brought me nothing but bad luck. My advice to any of you, is don't buy this peice of junk! Everything about it is fake. The picture is a fraud, the description is a hoax, & when you receive it in the mail, you will be disappointed. The wood is fake, the holy water is fake. It is not durable, reliable or sturdy. And unless you want to use this rosary for looks only, don't count on your blessings when it comes to this peace of bark-wood! Literally! Wish I could get my money back! Sadly, this is my first and The last rosary I will purchase from this company. Good luck and good riddens!!!!!!! <end>  Holy water is not from the river Jordan  The rosary is beautiful and sturdy but the certificate is not like the one in the picture. It says it is holy water. There is nothing about it being from Jordan. I would send it back but I need it to go with a rosary box I purchased and I dont have time to find another one, on or off line.It is disappointing. <end>  Kelly Odom's review  I gave this vendor a negative review, but it was an honest mistake. They are sending me a new item plus an extra prayer bracelet. They are a very nice and responsive company. Please disregard that negative feedback, I should have given them a chance to respond before I wrote it. They are a nice company, please feel free to do business with them.Thanks! <end>  Great item!!!!  Very pretty, the picture was spot on. Was very happy I received it early for my mom for Mother's Day. I purchased this rosary because it was unique, from all the other rosaries my mother owns. Would order from them again. They will be my first stop for more unique rosaries. <end>  Beautiful  I purchased this for my son's First Holy Communion and he loved it. Although it wasn't as pretty as it's photo appeared it is still very nice and different than any other rosary his friends were given. I think given its rarity and attractiveness my son will cherish it for years to come. <end>  Broken when I received it  When we received the item, the packaging stated that the rosary contained holy water...it said nothing about water specifically from the River Jordan, as the item description indicates. When we opened the rosary to examine it further, it was ALREADY BROKEN. We took it out of the package broken. It seems to be cheap quality and the "holy water" simply looked like a bit of scummy yellow glass. We are unable to tell whether or not there is even water contained in it. We are extremely unhappy with our purchase. <end>  sent a crucifix damaged, I will not bother to return it, okay I lost my money but you lost a customer.  sent a crucifix damaged, I will not bother to return it, okay I lost my money but you lost a customer. <end>  Just what i expected  I love this product, it came on time and intact, beautiful rosary...exactly what i expected it to be!!!!!!! would definitely recommend it. <end>  Excellent Gift  This was a gift for my wife and she loved it. It's made out of wooden beads and it has holy water from the Jordan River. It is the perfect gift. <end>  Olive Wood Rosary with Holy Water from the River Jordan  NOT WORTH THE INVESTMENT! After only a couple of uses I had a broken (and missing) bead. I tried to get HolyLand Market to replace the item but the best they could offer was to sell me another one at half price!! Who's to say it would not happen again?? Not wise to throw good money after BAD so I was forced to EAT THE LOSS. <end>  Right item and on time. Thanks!  Thank you for sending the correct item, carfully wrapped and on time. Great quality. This was a gift and it was well received. <end>  wood rosary  this was a beautiful rosary, but the metal links are soft and it began falling apart soon after i got it. i'm a nurse and i was keeping it in my pocket when i worked but now am unable to because it can't be repaired. <end>  Beautiful Rosary  My daughter has MS and I bought this rosary for her. She lovesand cherishes it. <end>  A lovely gift  Purchased these to replace my son's rosary. He really likes the olive wood beads and the drop of water from the Jordan was an added bonus. <end>  crossed  this cross is beautiful but beware it is easily pulled apart. looks like they used staples to hold it together <end>  amazing and powerful....  This is an amazing company and an amazing powerful rosary. I am so grateful to have gotten this and feel its power when I hold it or wear it. <end>  Beautiful  This is absolutely beautiful! The wood is awesome and shines like gold. This was bought as a present. I can't say too many more spectacular things about this item. <end>  I love it...i love it  This is special for me. I love this gift. If you are a christian are a believer in God this is a good item to have. I have been bless since I have it. <end>  beautiful  Its a very beautiful rosary I get a lot of compliments at work from customers. Its fragile though so be careful. <end>  AWFUL!  When I got this in the mail last Friday, it was in good shape (or so I thought it was). Now I have discovered that the centerpiece contains water from the Jordan River was not in the centerpiece and the back of the centerpiece (contenting the water) broke off. I'm so very upset. <end>  Very Nice Could Have Stronger Links  I like this rosary. The olive wood beads are very nice. The links however are very soft metal which is a shame because it is a fragile rosary and I am concerned about everyday use. <end>
 B000B5LWMY  Wood Jewelry Armoire Dresser/chest with Hand Painted Floral Accents and Queen Anne Based Legs ||	  Hand Painted Jewelry Armoire  Wood Jewelry Armoire Dresser/chest with Hand Painted Floral Accents and Queen Anne Based LegsThis armoire is lovely. It features an off white background with hand painted lavender roses and delicate leaves and vines in green. It has lined drawers with a variety of compartments. Both sides open to hold necklaces and chains, and the top opens to reveal more compartments and a mirror. My only complaint is that it requires assembly, and attaching the top and getting it centered was a bit troublesome for me. Also, the quality is good not excellent, yet once it was put together, I found it to be well worth the trouble. It is very pretty and overall I am pleased with my purchase. <end>  beautiful,functional  This jewelry armoire was well worth the money I paid for it. It holds lots of jewelry-necklaces do not tangle,earrings stay together, and bracelets hang neatly.The top opens to reveal places to hold/display rings,too. For a floor armoire,it is compact enough to fit beside my dresser in my bedroom.I have had this armoire for several years and it has been very functional,and very beautiful.I have no complaints. <end>  pretty painting  The Amoire holds a lot of jewelry.But this chest is made of cheap materials and is constructed poorly.One door will not stay closed and the drawers won't slide in straight.The back is cut too short for the screws to catch in back for the door hinge.I like the style and the painting and the storage space. <end>
 B000B5MK9S  Isabella Rose 9-10mm Pearl Dangle Sterling Silver Earrings - Various Pearl Colors ||	  Pretty earrings!  I love this earrings! it is very pretty. The quality is very good. Beautifully designed - it is so feminine. The rose motif is so cute. Also it came in a very nice wrapping. Excellent service. I am quite satisfied with this product and their service. <end>
 B000B5OEZG  Peach Pink AAAA Cultured Pearl Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Stud Earrings (LS1B) ||	  Excellent value and quality  I bought this pair of pearl studs for myself a few weeks ago. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and size of the pearls. It's perfect for daily wear and it was only $9!! I definitely recommend this for anyone that's looking for something simple, yet elegant. <end>  Peach Pearl Earrings  These are very lovely, large earrings. The color is a soft peach and I have received many compliments on them. One caution is that they are a bit heavy. <end>  Very Nice Gift  Planning on giving this to someone special. It is very nice and all of my female friends approve of it's quality. Hope she likes it  ) <end>  great earrings!  The peach pearl earrings are perfect for any woman. I love pearls and have only had white. Recently I purchased a larger pink pearl earring from Dahlia and then got these peach ones. The color is a delicate, soft shade of peach. I do love my pearls. Dahlia has great stuff, worth every penny. You won't be disappointed. <end>  Very pretty color!  These are a perfect peach pink color! Not too dark, but soft, pale and creamy pink. The size is not too big, either. The button shape helps to make it look more subtle, not sticking out of the ears. They are not PERFECTLY shaped, though, one button shape looks more flat than the other, but since I didn't pay any money for these, I am not complaining. I received them as a free promotional gift from Dahlia. The shipping package was in a plain business envelope with the earrings wrapped in plastic bubble.Overall, these are very nice earrings! <end>  Beautiful ones  Second gift that impressed my lady. Beautiful and delicate pink,she told me. Looks like you make things specially for her. In addition, so fast to get them in the mailbox, a couple of days and they are there. <end>  4.6 review  As with anything else by Dahlia, they look better in real life than they do here on the web, and are worth more than they sell them for. 5 stars for earrings... but because of the way they were shipped to me, I cant state everything was perfect. Although there was no damage, and they arrived very timely, they were shipped inside of a small plastic bag, with no padding of any kind, inside of a regular envelope. Only complaint. Thats it. Wife loves them, and I'm totally buying more pearls from them... as this was the only thing they shipped to me like that. Everything else has been 100% classy, so I cant give them less than a 5 star rating. <end>  Just right.  Very pretty earrings. The peach color is very subtle--they almost look ivory, depending on the light. The shape of the pearls is very smooth and nice. They look great on. Thank you, Dahlia Pearls! <end>  Very pretty, just what I was looking for  These are perfect pearls for casual daywear or dressy events alike. They are a little pinker than I had hoped, but that might just be my tastes. They're pretty nonetheless. Not too small, not too big (check the measurements though, don't go by the picture). No visible blemishes, and personally, I love the button shape. Quick shipping also. <end>  Wonderful  These are so pretty! They're a much softer shade of "orange" than the picture, and they look so pretty next to my white pearl earrings (also from Dahlia!) when I wear them together they set each other off so well, I'm thinking about wearing both colors for my wedding! My two year old (who has pierced ears) also likes wearing them and they are such high quality that they dont break her skin out (She is allergic to some metals) and they dont overwhelm her small ears either! They are a beautiful gift for anyone! <end>  simple and elegant  If you are looking for a gift for you or your loved ones, with reasonable price and good quality. This pair of Pearl earrings is definitely right for you. The back is very sturdy, not like some other earrings I owned before. I wear them 24 hours and not worrying about waking up only to find one earring missing due to bad back quality. The color looks softer and prettier in the real thing compared with shown in the picture and fits well with my fair skin. Recommend without reservation! <end>
 B000B5OEZQ  Stardust Silver Twist Bead Cultured Pearl Drop Earrings, White ||	  not nearly as impressive in person  I bought these earrings for my mother for Christmas. I was very dissappointed. The pearls are a milky white, not pinkish as they appear in the picture. They dangle a tad crooked. The pearls themselves are average at best. I do not recommend these earrings. <end>
 B000B5QEHM  Lavender AAA Cultured Pearl Strand Necklace w. Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Rose Clasp (LS1R2) ||	  Disappointed  My wife liked the Dahlia necklace I got her last year so much, that I ordered her another one this year. Very disappointed! First of all it was shorter than 16 inches, so it didn't fit as I expected. Plus, the color wasn't that impressive. Almost looked white. Needless to say, this will be the last Dahlia Christmas pearl necklace. What a shame  ( <end>
 B000B5QJHM  Willow Cultured Pearl Sterling Silver Dangle Earrings - Various Colors ||	  Excellent Product  The earrings I purchase were wonderful!

Were exactly as promoted and arrived right on time. Would certainly recommend this seller. <end>
 B000B61NCC  Sterling Silver Baroque Shaped Multifaceted Clear AB Crystal 1 inch Long Pendant Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Not as it looks in picture!  There aren't any colors in this pendant, just a ugly topaz which ruins the pendant, same happened with heart I ordered from this seller. Normal Swarovski crystals do NOT have a Topaz covering the beauty of the crystals. Sorry I wasted my money, should have bought from Swarovski site! <end>  looks like glass  This pendant looks great in the picture but when I received it, it looks like yellow glass, doesn't look like a crystal at all. I'm very dissapointed! <end>  Very pretty  This is a very pretty crystal pendant, exactly as I hoped it would be. Others have said they look like glass, but they are much more reflective that glass, and reflect back very vibrant colors depending on their surroundings. The reason people have been complaining about them being yellow is because they are viewing them under yellow indoor lighting, and the crystal reflects the yellow dominantly. Try it outside, though, and you'll be blown away by the colors. My wife loves it, and I am very glad I got it for her! <end>  Multi Faceted Swarovski Pendant  I bought this pendant, as well as the earrings for myself, they are beautiful. I've got nothing but compliments on them. Great gift to myself. Thanks <end>  Beautiful!  When you first take it from the box it will look yellowish, but you need to try it under different light (natural light) and you will be amazed by the beautiful colors. It's a very beautiful pendant and I love it. <end>  Not as shown  I ordered this pendant to match some earings I ordered at the same time. Yes they match, but the hues are not as shown. The back of the pendant and earings have a golden finish and they gleam gold. I wanted the tradition Swarovski with all the various hues. Sending these back. <end>  I love the look!  I got the earrings and pendent as a present for myself, I love them! The colors are fantastic! They are primarily yellow when in the house but outside the hues change to match your surroundings. I am looking at getting matching sets for my daughter-in-law! <end>  Sparkling wonders  While this pendant mightlook yellowish when you first take it out of the box, try it under different light conditions. It sparkles like crazy and reflects many different colors in a rainbow effect. It looks especially pretty in combination with the earrings. My niece just adored the set. <end>  Just Beautiful!!  I thought it would be a little bigger, but that does not take away it's beauty. I really recommend it. <end>  Good.  I thought the pendant would be a little more round based on the picture but it is in fact like a flat tear drop shape with jagged edges. Either way, it reflects light nicely! <end>  Love this pendant  This pendant looked bigger in the picture. I almost did not buy it for that reason. However I took a chance and I'm glad I did because it's actually a litle smaller then pictured. The colors are bright and vivid when the sun hits it. Today was the frist time I have worn it and I have had three people ask were I got it.I have ordered several items from Gem Ave. and I believe they are honest with the descriptions of there items and I always receive the items within the time they say. In fact I usually receive items early. <end>  Wonderful Pendant  This product is as beautiful in reality as it seems to be on-line. It does come without a chain but adding a silver chain is no problem. I know I will enjoy this for years to come. <end>  BEAUTIFUL!  This is a quality item! The sparkle is amazing and I have received MANY compliments when wearing it. I plan on buying more to give as gifts. Absolutely beautiful! <end>  Yellowish looking  I was very disappointed in this. I bought it to match a pair of Swarovski Crystal earrings (and it did match perfectly) but my earrings are crystal (pun intended) clear and the pendant has a horrible yellow look to it. I kept it but now I wish I had a clear pendant that matched my earrings. I wish I would've been told in the description that it was not clear. I can't say I'd ever be too eager to purchase from them again. <end>  multi faceted chrystal pendant  This pendant along with the Swarovski earrings I had bought recently are sooo beautiful!I wore them together to work and everyone wanted to know where I bought them.They couldn't believe the price as well!These were BLING to the max and I would rather wear Swarovski products than diamonds as I get more feedback!Thank you so much for allowing me to buy something so beautiful for such an inexpensive price. <end>  A little discolored  The pendent arrived in a timely fashion, but unlike the picture was mildly yellow. This is not just the lighting, I took it outside just to make sure. The color is bearable, and only extremely noticable again dark color shirts. I plan on keeping it, but I will have to limit wearing it with light shirts, shame. <end>  Perfect match!  The pendant is a perfect match for the earrings I got for a friend of mine. Sparkly, shiny, reflects the colors of its surroundings beautifully. My friend loves it. <end>  Nicer for a teenager than an adult  This is a fairly nice looking stone with significant shine. However, the workmanship was not as impressive as I had hoped and I didn't meet my personal standards. I gave it to my 15-year old daughter rather than take the time to return it. <end>  I ordered this will many sterling silver necklaces, very nice  I think this is pretty. For the price, I am very happy. It looks great on the Sterling Silver necklace that I bought from the same seller. Very happy with everything that I got.I lost my first one, because ny chain broke. I had to have another one. So I ordered it again. It is just as pretty. I do love it! <end>  Nice little pendant  My wife got this to go with her dress for a military ball. She really liked it and said that it looks like a small prism that reflects all colors of the rainbow. The stone also changes color to match whatever she was wearing as well. Definately worth the money! <end>  Beautiful pendant.  If you think this thing looks good on Amazon, wait until you have it shipped to your house. This thing is so beautiful in person, especially when the light hits it. I recommend a 1 mm .925 sterling silver chain to wear it with, as they match very well together.I bought this together with the matching earrings, and this Christmas, after seeing these, I plan on buying my girlfriend another 3-4 pairs of different colours.This was a great buy. <end>  Great sparkle  nice looking swarovski crystal pendant that gives off a lot of sparkle for the price. Just enough sparkle with out being cheap looking. Look great for evening or day when you want to have a little touch of class but cannot have the real sparkle of diamonds. <end>  Dazzling pendant  Birthday gift for wife. This pendant was to complement earrings purchased from this seller. Wife was overjoyed. <end>  Present  I think the earring make perfect to give to someone as a present, i gave it to my friend as her birthday present and she's really happy about it. <end>  Very Pretty  I think for the price these are very beautiful pendants. They do have some topaz in them, but not much. I would buy again. <end>  Swarovski pendent  Very pretty pendant. The matching earrings add alot to the look. Very nice for the holidays. Dresses up holiday clothing. <end>  Clear Crystal pendant.  Very Pretty, colors change with what I wear. it is a perfect size pendant to wear to work. Love it. <end>  Very nice, catchs the light beautifully  This is a very pretty pendant that reflects back the colors and lights it sees. I love that about this pendant. It is the perfect size for shorter necklaces and will sparkle on your decollete. <end>  Gorgeous!  Super sparkly and brilliant. Absolutely love it and have had dozens of complements. The only other thing I might add is that it does not have the blue/purple lights as shown in the photo but is more golden...but still gorgeous. <end>  Great Pendent  I bought this pendant to match a yellow dress for formal night on a cruise. I'm glad I did because it is beautiful. It was also very affordable, and it arrived well packaged and fast. The pendent is fairly large. It also has a fairly large silver ring for threading through a necklace. The ring is large but part of the space is taken up by the pendent. The ring goes through a hole in the pendent, just in case someone doesn't notice that in the product picture. The pendent has a type of metalish, colorful material on the back. Probably to help the pendent capture color. This isn't a problem for me but if the pendent flips over then it would be noticeable so the pendent can only be worn one direction. The pendent also appears more yellow then anything else, I haven't worn it yet so I don't know if this will change or not but I read reviews that says it changes to match the colors reflected by the outfit it is worn with. All in all this is a great deal and I would recommend this item and seller. <end>  Outstanding Presence  I bought this pendant for my daughter for Christmas and was very pleased when I received the product. It was better than I had imagined and I am very pleased with the quality. She will be delighted. <end>  Swarovski Crystal Pendant, Earrings, and Bracelet  In addition to excellent service and amazingly fast delivery, I am more than pleased with the the quality, shine, clarity, sparkle and cost of the pendant, bracelet, and the earrings.If you are looking for a high quality and reasonably priced piece of jewelry for a loved one, you most definitely want to purchase any one ... or all of the above. You most certainly will not be disappointed.PMc <end>  All Positive  All of hte crystals that I have bought from here have been of great value. I have not had any problems with them. Thank you for having them. <end>  beautiful pendant  Beautiful pendant, Just as described in the picture, but more radiant. Yes it has jaggered edges, that what so unique! Love it & I have had so many compliments on this one. <end>
 B000B62UII  14k White Gold, 3-Stone Diamond, Teardrop Pendant (1/4 cttw, I Color, I1 Clarity) ||	  Beautiful and delicate  I purchased this for my girlfriend for valentines day last year. She wore it everday there after. Unfortunately the chain supplied with the pendant is very thin and has broken twice. the first time we were able to get it repaired, the second we decided to purchase a new chain. Diamonds seem to be good quality and look very beautiful. Good Product just have to be careful with the chain. <end>  I  I love it great product A + + + + + + + + + + + + ++ + <end>  It is beautiful  I bought one for my girl friend, and she is very satisfied with it.It is really beautiful. <end>  It's a deal!!  I bought this for my wife as christmas present. She loves it! <end>
 B000B66OJ4  Sterling Silver Organic Open Ring Pendant, 18" ||	  Not quite what I was hoping for  I gave this three stars because it's not an awful piece of jewelry, just not something that I like. The necklace is very shiny and bright, and the circle is very, very large. I suppose with the right outfit it would be great, but it's not casual enough to wear everyday. <end>
 B000B6868G  Sterling Silver Filigree Circle Pendant, 18" ||	  4 1/2 A Cut Above  The intricate design highlights this gleaming pendant from the new Amazon.com line (a designation which means you're just barely at the limit for Amazon.com free shipping!), and it makes a wonderful "little gift" for you or your designated giftee.Unlike some other relatively inexpensive jewelry, this pendant's lines are clean (no dangling nubs of silver here), and the surprisingly artisitc design is beautiful and well-balanced. There's a Celtic feeling to it; closer inspection reveals the clever pattern of romantic hearts. Moreover, the pendant and necklace are sized very well, neither ostentatious nor eye-straining. The clasp at the back resists self-tieing, but a friend can open the small clasp and place the other end in it.It's a little on the shiny side for my tastes, so I'd wear it with something light-colored. However, if you like a high-contrast effect that attracts attention to the pendant, wear it against something dark. It's light and comfortable enough that you could wear it either outside clothing or right against your neck. The pendant comes in a velvet blue presentation bag--nice touch, Amazon.com! Either as part of a special day, or for an anyday surprise, this and other pieces in the Amazon.com line are affordable, nicely made, and lovely to look at. <end>  Beautiful Necklass  This necklass is beautiful and the quality great. Vendor shipped the product quickly. I love it. <end>
 B000B69P0E  Sterling Silver Oval Link Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Good Quality  I have received many compliments on this bracelet. It can be worn with any attire. It is comfortable, meaning not too light or too heavy and well made. It has a style of its own (unlike many bracelets). A nice looking piece of jewelry. <end>  Nice bracelet!  I ordered this because I had the matching necklace and loved it. It is a nice weight and very unique. I have received many compliments on the necklace and expect the same for the bracelet. I had a small problem with both pieces as the split rings opened up. My husband soldered them for me so I don't expect it to happen again. The bracelet especially is easily hooked when moving near something due to it's design. Overall very pleased with the look and quality. <end>  Love it!  Love this bracelet. It is sterling silver and has held up so well. Once in awhile I go over it with a silver polishing cloth and it looks shiny & beautiful again. It is such a versatile piece -- casual to dressy. It is my go-to accessory. <end>  beautiful.  I love this bracelet, it's versatile and elegant,I can wear it with everything,jeans or dress. I do have a problem with the clasp though,difficult to close by myself.One more link would have made it perfect,since it's tight around my wrist.I like my bracelets to move up and down my arm.I'm going to replace the clasp with a larger one. <end>  Great value for $  Bought bracelet and matching necklace while they were on sale. Absolutely no complaints--good quality silver and weight for the money. <end>
 B000B69P18  Sterling Silver "Hope" Pendant, 18" ||	  pretty pendant  We got this for our daughter's birthday (her middle name is Hope) and it is very pretty. It is not a "dainty" as it looks, but that is a good thing as she is a bit rough on her jewelry sometimes. <end>
 B000B6CNIK  Sterling Silver Oval Link Necklace, 16" ||	  Very Pleased  I'm so pleased with the quality and the looks of this necklace I had to order the whole set. (Necklace, earrings, and bracelet) It looks great either dressing up or down. I give it 5 stars because it deserves it! <end>  Cheap looking  The necklace in the picture looks a lot thicker and heavier than it is. For a two hundred dollar necklace it's very cheap looking. I wouldn't have paid more than twenty five bucks for the necklace! <end>  Nice piece of jewelry for a great price  I purchased this necklace during a special when Amazon was giving an extra 70% off an already reduced price. Crazy! Since I paid next to nothing for this necklace, I wasn't expecting much. I was very pleased upon reciept, as it is much nicer and heavier than I imagined from the picture. I'm waiting on the matching bracelet to come up on a similar deal. <end>  Very nice!  I also was happy with the quality of this necklace. I was able to get it at a deep discount which was great, but I think I would still be happy had I paid full price! <end>
 B000B6CNJE  Sterling Silver Butterfly Pendant, 18" ||	  Beautiful  I ordered this for my 11 yr old Granddaughter & she thought it was absolutely beautiful. <end>  Very Pretty  This necklace is a beautiful piece of jewelry. Small, not gaudy, on a sparkling silver chain. Exactly what I was looking for. <end>  beautiful, durable  excellent value, my wife loves it. so does my daughter. it is not gaudy or over the top. just a simple small butterfly in sterling silver. excellent purchaase <end>  Wonderful  The butterfly isn't nearly as big as I thought it would be but I absolutely love mine. I can put it on easily with out any issue, the chain fits around my neck and doesn't snag my hair like some of the chains I own. The necklace is low key, and conservative so I can wear it with a lot of my work outfits and it looks nice. My mother bought mine for me and I'm happy she did. Wouldn't trade it in or send it back. <end>  The little sliver butterfly  I was so happy to see the quality of the butterfly pendant when it came in the mail. I absolutely love it and receive many compliments every time I wear it. <end>  Very beautiful  I give this to my mom, she couldn't like it more, it's very beautiful and elegant necklace. <end>  Good Gift Idea  This is a very nice necklace and is of realitivly good quality for the price. <end>  Butterfly pendant  I was not happy with them. The measurement was off, I thought they looked like $5 necklaces. They were to wear in honor of my mother in law who passed of cancer. I sent them back. This was the first time I ordered jewelry and was very disappointed. I went to our local mall and found the perfect pendant at Macys. <end>  Crakerjack toy  This piece of crakerjack toy i recieved was just that. There was no size on the add,and they made it look so great.i wished I would have read the comments more carefully. I was on vacation when it came so I can't send it back without it costing me a return charge. <end>  Okay, for the price. Cheap chain.  This was probably worth the discounted price I paid...the previous reviews were absolutely correct; it is suited for a child or small person, although it touts an 18" chain. The chain is very cheaply made and that 18" is a stretch at the outside link of the adjustment, which has no "tail" link to use for fingertip feel. Likewise, the hardware on the other side is so conservative of materials that it is difficult to even hold the very small ring open long enough to reach the back of the neck when trying to put it on without assistance. The butterfly is nice, but just that...nice. If I had it to do over again, knowing now...I wouldn't have ordered it. But there's nothing faulty enough to warrant sending it back, either. Again, for a child it is a lovely size and gift. <end>  nice, but small  I got this originally for my wife, but my daughter loves it so much, and it is about a nice size for a child or teenager..good value for what you get. thx <end>  God-daughter loved it!  I bought this as a Christmas gift (06) for my god-daughter Michelle. She absolutely adored it. She told me she only wears it to church and special occasions. I loved the price! <end>  Not sterling!  Yes, it's pretty, but it isn't sterling when you can pick it up with a magnet. <end>  Small and cheap  This necklace looks very nice online, but in person is very small and cheap looking. It would be fine for a child but not for an adult and should be advertised as such. The chain is very cheap also. I am able to return it but hate that return shipping is not covered. <end>  Great buy  This necklace is perfect. It is delicate and you can wear it with your blue jeans or you can wear it dressed up. It fits any wardrobe. <end>  Not too crazy about the shape...  I got the sterling silver butterfly dangle earrings and pendant for $25 (they were 50% off). This was my first purchase of jewelery from Amazon, so I really didn't know what to expect. The earrings and pendant came packaged in separate cardboard jewelery boxes and each were in little plastic bags. Considering the price, the quality of the earring and pendant weren't too bad. I liked the earrings better than the pendant. I'm always looking for dangle earrings that aren't too big, so I was pleased with the tiny size of the earrings. However, for most adults, I think that the earrings would be a bit too small and dainty. These earrings would be perfect for girls or teens. If you are an adult and are looking for earrings that are tiny and cute to wear with a casual outfit then these would work as well.The pendant wasn't as cute as the earrings. The pendant came with a small silver necklace. The bottom part of the pendant is to pointy and the wings don't look that much like a butterfly. I would have liked something shaped like the earrings. If you don't mind the shape (the picture looks just like the real thing), the pendant would probably work well for girls or teens. Like the earrings, the quality is not too bad for something that was less than $15.Overall, I was pleased with my first jewelry purchase. If you are looking for something cute and inexpensive I would recommend these (especially for girls or teens). <end>  Beautiful Butterfly  I love this necklace! It's absolutely gorgeous! That's all that needs to be said! <end>  daughter loved it  I got this for my daughter and she wore it a lot even to the dance last weekend so I think she liked it. <end>  Very Nice Pendant  I was pleased with this butterfly.The necklace has a little weight to it. This is a gift for a young woman of college age,friend of my son's. I am glad the "Care Instructions" came with it. <end>

 B000B6FNL4  14k Gold Channel-Set Gemstone Hoop Earrings ||	  good earrings  Good quality earrings. The gems are darker than the photo and the inner side of the the hoop is not solid. more detail int he photos would be helpful. my girl loved them and liked the design on the tail end of the hoop after the gemstones. <end>  Love the Earrings  I love these earrings. This is my second pair. I also have the ones with the amethyst. They are small but just perfect for me. <end>  Beautiful!  These earrings were purchased for a friend for her birthday. I loved them so much that my daughter bought me a pair. They are small but, even though large earrings are fasionable, not all of us have the long necks to wear them! The stones were a nice color and the details on the earrings were very nice. <end>  Beautiful earrings-well worth the money  I am very pleased with these earrings. I have been wearing them for a month now and get many positive comments on them. <end>  14k Yellow Gold Channel Set Round Coated Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings  Great little earrings! I bought them for my Mother-in-law and she loved them. Mine came in a little blue bag(not in a regular earring box) I had to find a box to put them in. Well made and nice earrings. <end>  Perfect!!!  These earings are PERFECT. For someone who likes small earings and doesn't want my earlobes at my shoulders by the time I am 50 - these are PERFECT! The color is wonderful and quality is amazing. So happy with my purchase. <end>  Much prettier in person  The color of the stones is much brighter and prettier than the picture shows. I love these earrings! It was exactly what I was looking for. <end>  14k Yellow Gold Channel Set Round Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings  It was a gift and I was pleased with the good quality and workmanship. <end>  Perfect for my little girl  After I read all the reviews which stated it was too small, I was sure that this was the right set for my 3 year old. It's the perfect birthday gift that I have bought for her so far, Amethyst being her birthstone. It is perfect for her tiny ears and can definitely look lost on an adult's pair of ears. Well designed, I love it and so did she. <end>  Gorgeous earrings  Very classy and gorgeous earrings.Thank you for the speedy dispatch of this item. <end>  PETITE, TASTEFUL, AND LOVELY!  I purchased these amethyst earrings as a 60th birthday gift for my favorite cousin. I thought they were beautiful when I received them. My cousin cried when I gave them to her....because she thought they were beautiful, too!These are not large 'hoops', but they are quite lovely and in very good taste. The channel setting of the stones is both classic and modern-looking....and you won't catch a hair strand on any prongs.Gentlemen, your lady won't be disappointed. Ladies? Indulge yourselves and buy these...the price is right! <end>  beautiful tiny earrings  These high quality well made earrings are smaller than a dime. The stones continue on the bottom of the earrings, but there are not stones inside the back (in other words they are not an inside/out design). Instead there is a nice scroll design on the backside of the loop.I'm very pleased with my purchase. I do wish they were larger or that amazon offered the same earring in a larger hoop size. <end>  Great tho small earrings  I love this earrings. They were a bit smaller than I had expected but they look classy and are well make. I wear them everywhere with many compliments. Fast delivery in a nice box. <end>  14K Yellow Gold Channel Set Round Amethyst Hoop Earrings  These are exceptional earrings. Great size, can be worn to work, to dinner or just out for the day shopping. Beautiful color to the stones and the setting is unusual in a nice way, the picture doesn't show it, but the back of the hoop has a cut-out design, so the earrings are almost as pretty from the back as from the front. <end>  Birthstone earrings  These were purchased for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas gift. My grandson's birthstone is amethyst and I wanted her to have a pair of earrings in his stone. They were so lovely I almost kept them for myself. <end>  earrings  very small delicate earrings - very nice for someone who does not want earrings that dangle. beautifully made. <end>  Great value  The quality and color of the channel set rolund amethyst hoop earrings was a great value for the price paid. <end>  Dainty and Elegant  I bought these for my twenty-something sister-in-law... she loved them and put them on right away. They ARE small, so be aware; she is tiny with delicate features, and usually only wears stud earrings, so they were perfect on her. These would be too small for someone who usually wears larger or flashier earrings.There is a bit of space between the stones and the metal that doesn't really show in the pictures, but it's nothing you notice once they are on. In all, a great value! <end>  GREAT VALUE  I'M IMPRESSED. THIS IS FINE JEWELRY WITHOUT THE PRICEY LABEL. VERY WELL MADE, 14K IS WITHOUT THE NASTY FILLERS THAT TRIGGER ALLERGYS AND THE STONES ARE OF GOOD QUILITY. <end>  Wonderful Little Earrings  The earrings look just as beautiful as they are pictured. From reading the previous reviews I was hoping they would be small, but I expected the stones to be light in color. I am delighted to find that they are indeed small and the stones have very good coloring. They are a perfect size for everyday wear, should be comfortable to sleep in, and they are quite attractive. <end>  Smaller Than I Wanted  I purchased it as a gift but had to return it because it was quite smaller than I expected. I read some comment saying it was smaller and had some expection but still it is too small.And I do not think it is that pretty neither when you look at the real thing. I think it is better to get a bigger one even you have to pay some more. <end>  Too Tiny for a larger woman  I was thoroughly disgusted with the size of these earrings. I shouldhave read other's reviews before purchasing them. The topaz is prettybut hardly visible. Surely they come in a larger size. <end>  Baby Earrings  This are not adult earrings this are baby earrings. I was very dissapointed with their size. Quality was good I think my wife will keep them for one of my grandaughters, or return them, I don't know. Thank for a ruined christmas gift. <end>  Wifey  I waited until these babies were on sale for nearly half off and then bought them for a gift..My wife really loves them so that's all that matters! <end>  It's okay  It is okay, however it was received with little warmth.Charles <end>  Very nice, but small  A well designed set of earrings, but like other reviewers said they are on the smaller side. <end>  They are nice  These are very nice earings. The only thing that I wish they were a little bigger. I did get a great price on them during a lightening deal. <end>  You get what you pay for.  These earrings are very lovely--just a little smaller than I expected. <end>  Very Happy with them  After a lot of searching, these were the closest to what I wanted for the money and they were well received as a birthday present.They are nicely made though I really would prefer not having the hinged arm. It has not a been a problem yet with these but they can more easily get caught in scarves and the like. <end>  Perfect gift.  Purchased for a Christmas gift and couldn't be more pleased. They are absolutely beautiful. Very delicate yet substantial enough to be classy. Stones have just enough color, light blue and very sparkly. Arrived quickly and with a very nice gift box. <end>  Disappointed  I thought they would have been larger and you could hardley see the Amethyst stones , I hope next time I buy I will be happier . <end>  I LOVE THESE  I love these earrings. They are beautifully made, small (but that's what I wanted), elegant, very comfortable for every day wear. Thank you Amazon! <end>  amethyst earrings  very well made hoop earrings for a classy look. Can be worn anywhere. very comfortable and suitable to wear anywhere. <end>  Very small, but pretty - a good buy from Amazon.  I don't like big hoops. These are a perfect size for me. They were in perfect condition with good stones and clasps. With gold being so high now, these were a good buy. <end>  nice small earring  Very well made little earring, although the stones are very pale amethyst. The size etc are as stated in the ad and am quite happy with them. Just wish the stones were a deeper purple so that they would show up more. <end>  38wdeez  Nice quality gold earrings. Really impressive for price point. Unsure of quality of stones, but overall they are a good pair of everyday use earrings and get lots of nice comments. <end>  Tiny, Not Bright Color, Non-Secure Closure, Yet Overall Pretty  The earings are really small (which I do not mind), the blue is barely noticible (which I do mind since the color is the whole purpose of buying blue topaz) and the closure is not secure - I lost one of the earings the second time I wore them (kinda mind that as well  ) ). When you look at them though, they are pretty and understated. Although I am not entirely sure that I can make this statement since I have only one of them now  ). <end>  A great gift for any age.  I bought these earrings for my daughter when she turned 12. She has had them for two years now and still wears them every single day. I think that says it all. <end>  14k Yellow Gold Channel Set Round Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings  Great value, quality and craftsmanship; back-up with excellent service!The stones are clear and brilliant.Thanks!R. Caspers5 out of 5 stars...Jewelry <end>  Beautiful, petite, for kids & grownups  I bought these for my young daughter. I could just as easily see wearing these myself. They wrap fairly close to the lobe, definitely not a dangly hoop, hence the reason I got them for an active, playful young lady. These are not earrings she will outgrow when she grows up...they are timeless.The stones themselves are as depicted -- neither a deep purple, nor a pale lavender amethyst -- a very pretty mid-purple. The hinge function operates well, and clicks solidly into place. The gold feels substantial enough to assure the earrings won't get bent or damaged with normal wear.One criticism  they come packaged in a tiny velvet pouch that is inside a cheap cardboard box. Could have benefitted from a proper, hinged jewelers box. <end>  Great Deal!  These earrings are comfortable, well crafted, have nice color and perfect for casual to dressed up attire. As other reviewers noted;these earrings are on the petite side. I find the size to be a plus since they are 14k gold and still light weight for my sensitive ears. I'm thinking about buying a couple more pairs of these with other gemstones. <end>  nice but...  this item is nice but to small. the stones are to close together. they hang good but still so small. <end>  Very small - Catch loose  Earrings are pretty, though very small. However, post catch was loose. I returned them. <end>  Simple and lovely earrings  The fact that it is only under $90.00, I thought it was fake. For $89 it is worth the money and will buy again. You will love this item !!! <end>  Perfect gift, well received by my wife  She loves the color of the stones and says the size is just perfect. Another gift that hit the mark. Recommend for you guys trying to find something special for her. <end>
 B000B6H3E4  Single 2mm Round Diamond 10 K White Gold Stud Earring ||	  Cheap but reaally tiny diamonds  I first ordered this thinking it was incredibly cheap without realizing that this is for ONLY ONE EARRING forcing me to buy a second. While it is still relatively inexpensive and my wife did not have any adverse reactions to the post material, the diamonds are very very small and can be difficult to see with the size of the mount. <end>
 B000B6KTGS  14k Yellow Gold Peridot Tennis Bracelet, 7 1/4" ||	  Just lovely  Just lovely. Many compliments on this tennis bracelet. It is stunning. The stones are bright and clear,the basket type gold setting shows the peridots off perfectly. I love it. Green is the color that goes with almost any other. <end>  Flimsy, thin gold.  I returned this. I was quite disappointed in the feel... it was like a feather, not like gold at all. However, I regret my decision since my final price was 157-dollars U.S., and it now is going for 490! My wife has slapped me viciously about the head and shoulders ;-} <end>
 B000B6S0ZA  Sterling Silver Heart Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 6 mm Amethyst Colored 1 1/2 cttw ||	  Cute for the price  These were really cute earrings...my only drawback would be my hair tends to get caught on them often. The setting sticks out a bit farther than I kind of like but overall a nice pair of earrings for the price <end>  A very deep purple color  No problems at all and very cute. The color is a little too dark, and won't sparkle as much as lighter colors, but it is certainly pretty in it's own way. Fast service and early delivery. <end>  Beautiful earrings  I have ordered many items from Sabrina Silver, and ALWAYS been pleased with my purchase. They are good quality, and beautiful pieces at a great price!! <end>  Beautiful  If you like hearts and beautiful earrings that don't cost a fortune, but look like they do, then this is for you. <end>
 B000B6TTN2  Sterling Silver Heart Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 6 mm Blue Topaz Colored 1 1/2 cttw ||	  earrings  These looked pretty cheapo when I got them, but I guess I shouldn't have expected much given the price. I ended up never wearing them. <end>  Good item  There is an inconsistency between the pair of earrings I received. The cutting of the stone is different on the top of each stone, resulting in one with more sparkle. Not many people would notice, but I will overlook that a little bit because otherwise, these have a good color. I got what I paid for. <end>  great quality and price very beautiful ear rings  i bought these as a gift and she loves them ,, sabrinas silver is a favorite for jewlery i always look at their things first and im never disappointed with the quality or prices ,, signed a very loyal customer <end>  Very pretty and well made  They are very well made, and they sparkle so much! I loved the color. I bought them as a gift, and I can't wait to give them. <end>
 B000B6VS54  Sterling Silver Italian Curb Cuban Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 9mm Heavy weight Beveled Edges Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Link Chain  Once again the product received was better that expected. This merchant is great and this is my third purchase from them. I highly recomend this merchant to anyone. <end>  He looks stunning in it!  Ok! So here goes my first review and on jewelry. This was a gift along with the matching necklace for my boyfriend who tried on the same product at a farmer's market recently... this is stunning. I had to return it only because I miscalculated his wrist size. 9 is average I believe, nevertheless it was a nice weight without looking pimpish but enough 'pop' to notice a nice piece. LOVE it on him my only regret is why I never treat myself to such nice pieces. HA. Thanks, I will be back. <end>  Highly recommended  The chain was exactly what I was looking for. Excellent quality. I would shop from this seller again. <end>  Great buy  I bought this bracelet as a gift for my son, he really loved it. <end>
 B000B6WZDI  Sterling Silver Italian Curb Cuban Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 1.8mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Great chain!  This is a beautiful chain. It sparkles and is a little heavier in thichness. I wear it ALL the time and never remove it. So far it still looks brand new. I'm real happy with this purchase. <end>  Great for the money  This chain is the perfect size and great quality. It was better than I expected for the price. <end>

 B000B76N44  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Peridot Cubic Zirconia and Clear Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Nickel Free .925 Sterling Silver Band Peridot Cubic Zirconia Ring Size 9  This was a Christmas gift that my 16 son got for his girlfriend. 2 stones fell out in the first few days. Now we are going out today to check out Walmart, Kohls or Meijer to see if we can try again! <end>  Cute ring & fast service!!!  Impressive .925 Sterling Silver Band Peridot Cubic Zirconia RingThis item had an estimated delivery between May 1st and May 6th. It arrived early- April 30th!! It also came in a cute little ring box with a bow! The ring itself is very cute and dainty... better than the picture. It fit perfect and is probably the most comfortable ring I've owned. It just arrived today, so I don't know anything about how well the ring will hold up in the long run, but I'm very satisfied with it so far! <end>  Better than expected!!  I love this ring. Slim nice color and feeling. Even better you can use several together. I recommend it. <end>  Peridot Ring  This ring is beautiful, elegant without being flashy. The color is different; a soft but saturated lime green. It fits perfectly. <end>
 B000B7I8O2  Sterling Silver Eternity Cubic Zirconia 0.75 inch Long Round Pendant Charm ||	  Very pretty, but did not come with a chain!  I was so excited to finally receive this eternity charm; it replicates the popular designs sold in jewelry stores.I'd say it is very pretty and sparkly...great value for the cost! Mine is a little off-kilter (by that, I mean the circle is slightly uneven, meaning that it doesn't lay totally flat on a table), but it is definitely not noticeable at all when worn.The only thing is, this charm did not come with a chain (or necklace). I guess I just assumed it would come with one (even though looking back, there's no mention in the listing), but I ended up spending $20 at Target for a chain that worked for me. So, in the end, this ended up being a $30 necklace. Still, it cost less than going to a fancy jewelry store and it looks great!In my past experience with CZ, I'd recommend taking this necklace off to shower or even to put on make-up. I've learned that any moisture can make the gems seem a little cloudly, and this charm seems like it might be a little tricky to clean to get back to its original sparkle. <end>  Gorgeos eternity pendant  When I saw it I like it a lot I hoped that looks same as the picture. Have to admit that it's really gorgeous. If you want to have a nice jewelery pendant it's the right one. Seems all cz are diamonds so shiny. I hope only not to tarnish, because it's not rhodium plated.To avoid this I could advise to take off it when took a shower or put a perfume and body cream. <end>  Lovely Eternity Pendant  This eternity pendant is gorgeous. It looks like real diamonds (many cz pieces don't)and is very nicely made. This symbol can mean so many things so it makes a perfect gift for a loved one or a sentimental or just stylish piece for yourself. Either way it's an incredible bargain and a real beauty. <end>

 B000B85HYK  18K Gold Spectrolite Plasma Necklace by Suz Andreasen, MADE IN AMERICA ||	  Finally  Jewelry Products Made in America!  My Husband bought this amazing item for me for Mom's Day. I got it in the Suz Andreasen Couture suede pouch and when I saw the words MAde in America, I almost cried. My Son is in Iraq and I wear it every day and think of him. I wrote Suz Andreasen a letter, but THANK YOU WOMEN WANT JEWELRY FOR MAKING PRODUCTS HERE IN AMERICA! I am tired of jewelry made in China and India and I want to support local manufacturing. This company deserves a gold star! <end>
 B000B8G1NG  Sterling Silver Multicolor Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Simple and nice  I bought this along with the pink version and I like this one more. It's simple but it will go along nicely for a formal dinner or something like that. The pink, I thought, was a bit more childish looking. <end>
 B000B8KWWC  Sterling Silver Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Sparkling Pink Earrings  I ordered these earrings for a gift for our daughter. They are even prettier than they appear on the website and she just loves them. Great value for the price. <end>  Pink Earrings  Very nice earrings.

 B000B8URM2  Sterling Silver Italian Tubular Mesh Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 5mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 20 inch ||	  Think about it  This bracelet looks super. Also a bit different than your typical rope or link chain. Fun. I did not keep it because it runs small. It is not a true 8" bracelet for two reasons  first, it only measures about 7.5 inches and second the lovely mesh is thick so it takes-up some length just because of the style. So, if you like a 7.0 or 7.5" bracelet then this may well work for you. Enjoy! <end>
 B000B8URS6  Sterling Silver Italian Spiga Wheat Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 2.3mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Excellent and very strong!  I have been wearing this chain with a medallion hanging from it every day for almost 3 years. I have broken every single chain I have ever gotten in the past whether it be gold or silver, rope or box pattern, but this chain has never let me down. I cannot tell you how many times this chain has had hundreds of pounds of force on it while weight lifting, or how many times I have twisted it in my sleep, but it remains strong as new.I have gone through a lot of chains in my life and I am certain that if I ever manage to damage or lose this one, I will be buying the exact same thing to replace it. <end>  Atrractive, well made chain  It is a fair value for the price especially if you want something different in a silver chain. <end>  Stunning  Item arrived well before its due date, and was as advertised. The chain was well-crafted, and the silver itself possessed a stunning, white sheen. In fact, the white brilliance of the chain was so pronounced that the crucifix pendant for which I had purchased it - itself also sterling silver - did not match! Even so, I have kept this chain, because I am sure to use it as a gift. Related to this, I am pleased to note that the chain may grace the neck of either a woman or a man quite well, as it possesses traits of both refinement and strength. <end>  Exceptional !  Hard to find silver wheat chains...this isone of the best I've found. Strong yet refined ! <end>  quality piece  The necklace was to go with a locket I had purchased from another website. The description was very accurate for the measurements. It arrived within 3 days. This was a gift and I was pleased to give it to the recipient. <end>
 B000B8URSG  Sterling Silver Italian Spiga Wheat Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 3.1mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Exactly what I was looking for  I had been looking for a while for a nice, silver men's chain for a (not very small) Celtic cross I got some time ago. Something that was not too thick (hip-hop/goomba) nor too thin (feminine). I was also looking for a chain that was a good value (not outrageously expensive). This, to me, was "just right."It has a nice weight to it without feeling "heavy" and the "Wheat" link pattern doesn't visually compete with a pendant like a figaro or curb chain would. I did look at several other "Wheat" chains and some of the others had more open links or more closed links. Neither of which looked as good to me as this.The clasp is a good match to the scale of the chain - again, not too large and not too small - either of which would make the clasp very noticable if it rotated to the front.As a stocky guy who wears a 17" collar, I debated whether to get the 20" chain or 22" chain. I think the 22" would have hung a little low on me but for guys over 6 feet it might be a good choice.Mostly though, I have been impressed by how comfortable this chain is. It just feels good on my neck (and it doesn't catch or tug on chest hair.)I have been quite pleased with this purchase I think you will be too. <end>  Nice Chain  Nice medium weight chain. You could use it with pendents but not really small ones. Has a nice finish. Good to wear alone. <end>  Wardrobe staple  This is a simple, yet sturdy and attractive bracelet. I have worn it for six months straight and have received nothing but compliments. A real steal. <end>  Super Shiny Goodness!  I got this chain, so that I could have a "chain of reference" for a necklace I wanted to get for my husband's birthday (we had a gift certificate to a jewler, and I didn't know the name of the genre of chain linkage we sought) and during a search, I found this! Exactly what we needed! His birthday gift is here, in perfect 14k gold, so now I get to play with the stunt double chain...nobody can tell the diference between them until we show them the name&karat franking on his chain! Just plain WOW! Good going Sabrina Silver! <end>  Happy with this purchase  I purchased this chain for my son as a Valentines Day gift. We are very pleased! Excellent choice. <end>  Very happy  I am totally satisfied with this product. It arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered. Thank you so very much.Dan <end>

 B000B8WGXK  Sterling Silver Italian Figaro Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 3.8mm Beveled Edges Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Figaro Necklace  I felt that the description of this item was sadly misunderstood. The necklace itself is very pretty, but it look very fragile, its width is small, and the necklace is shiny. I enjoyed it as a female necklace, but hte purchase was for my boyfriend... it doesn't look masculene..it looks feminine. <end>  Not fragile!  After reading the other review of this item, I felt I had to set the record straight. I bought this chain to use with a pendant my husband bought me while on vacation in Mexico. The pendant is not small, and I needed a substantial chain. This chain is perfect! <end>

Light as a feather yet beautiful as a diamond. italian Fiagaro shows enough beauty when wored.

 B000B8YHNW  Sterling Silver Italian Figaro Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 2.3mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  smaller than I anticipated  Appears to be quality piece, smaller than I thought, however that's my fault for not reviewing and being fully aware of mm sizing..delivered on time in good condition...pricey for chain this small and thin, however if it holds up well to daily wear and tear it will be worth the purchase price... <end>  General recommendation for this maker  I have 3 Sabrina Silver chains, though not this particular style, two of which I've worn 24/7 for a couple of years. I can't say enough about how glad I am to have discovered this Amazon partner, because like the other reviewer here, I'm vulnerable to contact dermatitis from alloys. It's so bad I even get a rash on my tummy from prolonged contact with metal buttons on jeans. Nickel must be the chief culprit, because my Sabrina nickel-free silver chains have never raised so much as a speck of red itch. Durable, well-made, good-looking, reasonably priced, and biologically inert  )--gotta love it! Thank you, Sabrina and Amazon. <end>  Nice necklace  It's a pretty good sign of quality when I get this necklace mixed up with my white gold ones! You can't beat the price anywhere.

 B000BBC3N0  Emerg Alert Medical Id Jewelry Bracelet - "See Wallet Card" ||	  No problems  This medical alert bracelets arrived quickly. In two days. It is high quality, polished metal. I have no complaints with this <end>  for a man  I like it a lot but, its for a man's wrist not a woman's. It took over 15 minutes to get the hook over one of the links so that I could wear it. I would not buy it again. <end>
 B000BBH0TW  2 Piece Yin Yang Friendship Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Cute  I had expected to have two cords for this but I found out I had to buy it separately. I bought this for my old boyfriend and myself. We wore them everyday because we were into earthy connected stuff. And we did fit and click just like the necklace did. It was a good weight around the neck and the cords were perfect for it. <end>  Beautiful!  This is a very nice pendant, I bought it for me and my bf and it was absolutely perfect! Its a very nice gift! <end>  Nice piece  I bought this for my 15 year old daughter. It i so nice I think I'll order another for myself. It is a very nice piece. <end>  satisfied  I love how the necklace looks! I'll admit it is kinda misleading in the picture. The black does fade after a while that's the only complaint I have. <end>  Great Quality, wouldn't recommend any other!  The quality of this necklace was superb! I wear it with both pieces, and it looks really unique, not to mention better than anyone else's yin-yang necklace. Plus you can split in in half to share with someone else.Only down side is that if you want to share it you have to by two new necklace strings because of the make of the original string is leather, has no clasp, and has two knots in the back that you slip around to adjust the length.Love it though! <end>  Sweet  This thing is pretty cool. The only thing I didn't like about it was that you basically have to take the necklace apart in order to separate the two pieces. Other than that its a great product. <end>  Friendship Necklace  I bought this just for me because I love necklaces. I thought that it would come just as it did in the picture and it didnt. It wasn't very good quality and the strings were very strange and annoyed me. I cut them apart beause I didn't like them apart it just looked bad. They looked much better in the picture then they did when they arrived. I've ordered from Dan's Jewelers before and was satisfied but not this time. <end>  Its OK.  It's not bad, its ok, though it seems as if it was painted in white (the white parts obviosly) and it is not, its the color of the metal (pewter, thats kinda grayish), it seems white because of the light. As I said it's not bad but not exactly what they show it in the picture. <end>  Unprofessional  I purchased this item, along with two other ropes for it. The item itself never came. I contacted amazon customer service, and rather than making the company be held accountable for their mistake they are simply giving me a refund supposedly. I would not advice purchasing this or from this company until they can pull their act together, for you will surely be disappointed. My recommendation would be to buy it off amazon from another seller, or try ebay, because these guys can't take their job seriously. <end>  Only if you REALLY want one  I ordered this so me and my fiance could each wear one. I wanted it so whenever we wear it, we think of each other.Very fast delivery. I did standard shipping and it got here two days after I ordered.However, that's probably the only good thing about it.The part of the necklace that appears white (yin) is not white at all, but rather silver. Still cute, but I was expecting white. The metal was a bit rusted as well. Not too much, butn still noticable to anyone who looks closely. Lastly, the black material it came on was WAY too small for anyone to put around their neck. It doesn't have a place to latch in the back- it's simply a put over your head one. This is fine, but it's so small that I doubt it could even go over a Cabbage Patch's head.Overall, go ahead and get it if these things are fine with you. I kept mine simply because yin/yang friendship pieces are very rare and I'd been wanting one for both of us for a long time. I went out and got new chains to put them on. Definetly not worth the money I paid for the pieces and the new chains, but once again, I kept it because they're rare. <end>  2 piece pewter yin yang necklace  Beautiful necklace, cheap and delivered with nice packaging, fast,easy and safe transaction! will buy from here again! <end>  Will you be the YIN to my YANG?  I bought this necklace and gave half to my [ex]girlfriend. However since we have broken up I do not wear my half anymore...but she still wears her's! So it must be a good lookin & durable necklace. <end>  Exactly what I was looking for.  I needed something to express how I felt in a way that few words would say exactly that and the yin yang necklace did it for me. <end>  mediocre  wasn't impressed or disappointed. The medal wasn't really a circle and for some reason it felt really lame. I don't know what more to say it just wasn't cool enough. <end>  AMAZING!!  This necklace is a very wonderful gift for anyone who means a lot to you. I got this for an older lady friend of mine who I consider to be my greatest friend. She about cried when she opened this gift, its very simple, yet it holds a strong meaning for the wearer. She is never going to take her half off, nor will I. There are many friendship necklaces out there, but this one is one of a kind, and I recommend it to anyone who is attuned to their own sirituality and understand the symblism of the Yin and Yang. <end>  Really great stuff!!!!!!!  Really great stuff!!!!!!!, specially for 3rd world countries like Venezuela where soon will be impossible get good things because the leftgovernment (talking about dictator Chavez), well, I highly recommend this item. <end>  Love It!  The item is exactly what my daughter wanted. She loves it! She gave half of it to her boyfriend. They love it! <end>  Happy Valentine's Day  This was exactly what I had been looking for! I did the research on yin and yang and then gave one half of the pendant to my husband for valentine's day. Not expensive and quite sentimental. We both love the pendants and wear them daily. Dan's Jewelers was absolutely great to work with. They responded to each of my questions in a timely maner and the shipping was super fast. Thanks Dan's Jewelers!!!! <end>  Good Customer Service  I did not end up keeping the item since it wasn't exactly what I was looking for but their customer service was excellant. <end>  Perfection  My girlfriend and I live in Virginia but I got a job in California for a few months. During my time away, I wanted her to know I'd be thinking of her, and that I'd miss her. To show her that she was on my mind, I gave her this necklace, I took the black half, she took the white. She loved it and it looks very cool. I'm a very happy customer!I did need to buy a new chain for my girl before I gave it to her. The one it ocmes with isn't very comfortable. <end>  Great Product  It's a beautiful necklace and it was worth the cost. It's not filmsy or cheap, it's durable and great. <end>  Pristine  The necklace arrived quickly, especially considering that it came from Thailand. Good quality, for a good price. Thanks for good service. Will be buying jewelry from this seller again. <end>  Actual product not as shown  This is a clever little necklace idea, but the actual product arrives as two separate pendants. Each half is on its own cord, which is knotted quite sturdily. If you want to put the two halves together, you have to cut both necklace cords and then get a new cord to string them on. Very disappointing. <end>  Perfect for a couple  This is perfect for a couple. My brother in law is a Buddhist and I gave it to him and his wife they loved it. <end>  Just great.  Wonderful price and beautiful product.. Easy to use and the price is right. You can't go wrong with this product. !!!! Awesome <end>  Very cute!  This necklace comes on an adjustable necklace, which is kinda cool. But if you plan on sharing (bff kinda thing) you have to cut the necklace to get the pendant off. Not a big deal, it can be tied back together. <end>  Product rating  The 2 piece Yin Yang Friendship Pewter Necklace was exactly what I expected it to be. It arrived exactly on time <end>  Great Christmas Present  I purchased this item as a present for my friend and I. The piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone. I myself have the Yin half of the duo. The only problem is that the black paint in the Yin half is easily washed away. Now I don't mean that it all washes away but it does erode. The Yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint, however, but I do worry about all of the paint eventually going away. Other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull. I'll definately be buying from this seller again. <end>  great item for the price  Bought these for my husband and I back when we were dating. Love them. We still wear them. They got kind of beat up looking after a while (we've had them 3 years now) but they're not hideous lol. <end>  gift purchased  fast receipt of product - packaging good - was given to a teen as gift - it was sturdy THANKS! <end>  too bad  i bought this for my girlfriend...it was beatiful until we broke up. now i look at it in pain. but beside my heartbreak this is a great gift <end>  Yin Yang  I ordered this because it symbolizes me and my girlfriend. I was looking for Yin Yang charm that separates and came across this one first .It was the nicest of all charms I looked at. <end>  Great Necklace  I really like this necklace. The black cord feels nice, the yin and yang symbols are pleasing to the eye, and it didn't cost a whole bunch.The symbols are very smooth, and the necklace as a whole is just slightly smaller than a quarter. <end>  Liked it so much I gave it has a gift.  I have done Yin Yang exercises and thought if I ever came across a piece of jewelry I liked I would buy it. While browsing on line on Amazon I came across this. I decided to buy it. It is a nice piece for the price. I just wish it weren't in Pewter since it gets discolored. While I was at my Acupuncturists for a treatment he admired it. He has been a gift to me since he helped me with my back, no thanks to a Chiropractor who should have his license pulled. Anyway, I gave my Acupuncturist one as a gift for helping me with my problem. He was delighted since he is into all the Chinese herbs and medicines in his practice. A friendship was born with a piece of jewelry that symbolizes friendship. You can even separate the two pieces to share if you like. You would need another rope or chain if you do. The rope on this is adjustable so it can be worn at any length you desire. I thought sharing was just going a bit to far if you know what I mean. Of course, sharing is nice too. Enjoy. <end>  Great necklace set  Brought this for a one year anniversary for my boyfriend and I. He loves his dark half and I have the light half. I didn't like the string it came on so I used two seperate chains I already owned to put them on before gifting them. The picture is tricky as the lighter half is not white but a silver with an aged black dot, and the black piece looks aged too but really cool looking. We both love them and wear them all the time. <end>  Love it but...  I got it for my best friends b-day and was going to give her half and i the other but when i got the necklace the lace was knotted in a way that i had to cut it to separate the pieces. I ended up tying it back but it was a very ugly knot so i ended up buying 2 new laces! Overall i love it and so does my friend but laces need to be fixed! <end>  Gorgeous pendant  This is the second time I've bought this piece from Dan's Jewelers and I'm as happy with it now as I was with my first purchase. The pendant is gorgeous. I wear one half and my fiancee wears the other. Together we complete each other. The shipping is fast, the product is well represented and much prettier than pictured. Will keep buying from them until they turn me away  ) Thanks Dan's! <end>  Excellent item  The item was just as described and made a perfect gift for my best friend and I. Thank you so much!  ) <end>  two piece yin yang  The product arrived in a reasonable time and is everything profered on line. It is symbolic of the great mountain in China from which the symbol was derived. strong on one sid eand gentle on the other. The light and the dark...Many compliments from the 45 "Tai Chi Quang" students I study with and teach....When my life partner of forty years finishes the "YANG 24 international form" I planned on sharing with her the dark half representing the female side of the Yin Yangand keepign the light strong male side.. It is a quality product at a fair price. It would be very cool if the company would provide a second neck lace for the split...Jason Spence ... 50 years in martial artsTai Chi is the beginning and the end. <end>  great!  everything was fantastic! it arrived early, looks exactly the same as the photo, no fake advertising, and the rope-chain-thing is great too, it extends, but if you want to give one half to another person, you have to cut the rope and buy two whole new chains. all in all, I'm VERY happy <end>  Perfect  I bought this item for me and a friend. It comes on one cord so it's best to buy two separate cords and cut the one that this comes on. I kept the black side and gave the white side to my friend. Honestly it's my favorite item. neither of us take it off unless we have to. It's a great piece to really show your bond with someone. <end>  Wonderful!  A client of mine was looking for a two piece yin-yang pendant for over 2 years! I spent a couple of hours on the internet and was finally sent to Amazon, and of course they had it, by Dan's Jewelers. Beautiful piece in person, shipped fast and packaged very nicely, could have been given as is. I made two necklaces out of the pendant and my client was so happy he gave me a huge hug! What a great place to buy from. Will definitely order from them in the future! <end>  Great gift for husband and wife!  I gave this to my son and daughter in law for christmas and my son thought is was really great! I loved the response it got! Great gift for any couple! <end>  Nice Piece  It's a real nice pendent. Very unique. I am very happy with it. <end>  Just What I Needed  This necklace was entirely worth the money. It makes a great gift, and is really good looking. The on emistake I made is that the chain it comes on has to be cut to separate the pendants. Remember to buy two necklaces, not just one. 16" is on the shorter side, so especially for guys, a longer one might be a good idea. Rather than it appears to be in the picture, its not black in white but dark finish and light finish, which is still a really nice touch. The shipping was surprisingly fast, it came in a matter of days in Standard Shipping. Overall, a great product. <end>  Nice and Worth the Price  I was overall satisfied with this product. They shipped it out to me the next day, and I got it within 3 days (excluding Sunday obviously). The only problem I really had with it, is the black piece of the yin yang was not as black as I was hoping for, and thought the picture they showed looked darker as well. However reading some other peoples reviews, it seems they had the same issue. So I found something I had laying around the house and blackened it up a bit myself, and now it's perfect. Other than that it is very nice. I saw some people saying how the chain was too small to fit over your head, if you pull the knots apart (actually pull not untie) it makes the chain longer/smaller so it's adjusted to whatever length you want. This may be something they recently fixed I'm not sure, but no the chain is not too small it is adjustable and can fit over your head. If you're buying this for you and someone else make sure and get a second chain! Overall I would recommend this, delivery was good and on time, and everything was in good shape. <end>  Exceeded Expectations!  I was truly expecting something small and lightweight to arrive. NOT SO! This piece is large, heavy weight and very durable! WELL worth the money! <end>  Excellent delivery time, but...  The necklace is not coloured (i.e. black/white), but aged(yin) and smooth(yang). I would have liked it to be coloured, as this is what is displayed. If this is not what you get, I suggest the picture be updated. However, other than this I was overall satisfied and will cosider ordering other items. The price was extremely satisfying, considering the time and effort I put forth trying to find a pendant like this one. Next time I will make it a point to find out more about the product before I order. <end>  Not What I expected...  Length   4 46 MinsThis is a review I did on a Two Piece Yin Yang Necklace. It was the only one that looked good to me online so I bought. This is a video of my reaction.I made another video on YT of the Yang side of the product. A year later./watch?v=TTwb0k1nL_c <end>  Awesome necklace  my boyfriend and i are celebrating our one year anniversary nex month so i orderd these pendants. i wasent expecting much butwere truely worth the money i paid. so much so that iv decided to give him his half on his birthday. The cord it came on however was to smal to fit over anyones head, and quite hard to cut. But i expected that from other reviews and just bought a black silk cord for each of us. i will deffinily shop with this seller again! <end>  Grateful to find this, but expensive shipping  It was the only friendship ying yang necklace I could find anywhere. It was perfect, exactly what I envisioned. Fast shipping. Shipping was a bit expensive, though, considering the price of the item, but because the item itself was reasonably priced, I got over it. The other problem I had with shipping, and I don't know if it was the merchant, or Amazon, is that it indicated that the number of days for standard shipping would get it to me well before Christmas, but when I clicked on standard shipping it gave me a notice that I WOULDN'T get it before Christmas and I HAD to choose expedited in order to get it by Christmas. That did not make me happy. <end>  Kinda Cheesy  The picture looks better than the charm it's self. I bought it for my cousin who is 34. He didnt seem to interested in it. My son who is 11 liked it. I would buy it for someone 15yrs. or younger. <end>  YinYang Pendant Necklace  My son was very pleased with his Yin Yang Pewter necklace. I thought the price was a good buy. Thank you for your swift service. I will buy from your establishment again in the future. <end>  Great product  I bought this for me and my boyfriend for Valentine's day, and he always wears his piece. It's just the right size so neither person will complain about it being too little so that it makes them feel "unmasculine" or too clunky for those who like smaller jewelry. But this is NOT black and white, as I thought it was. It's silver and black, which was kind of disappointing, but it's a great product overall. He says he loves it and it's kind of a unique gift and nice to have. <end>  Great and then not great  I ordered this a year ago and IT WAS PERFECT. I ordered it again a month ago and instead of being the same as it had been, it came as two pieces and it wasn't possible for me to create one necklace out of it. Dan's Jeweler's, I love you, but why did it come as two separate necklaces a year later? I liked it better when it came as one necklace (on one rope) but with the two pieces dangling separately) not like this year when it came on two separate ropes. No problem with the transaction or shipping. <end>  Meh...  I have to say I'm kind of unimpressed. The picture that goes with this item is deceiving. When I bought the necklace I thought it was going to be black and white, but it was just silver. The lighting in the picture really makes it look black and white even though it really is silver and gray.If you want to buy this so you can share it with someone go for it; otherwise, I would look elsewhere for a Yin-Yang necklace. <end>  Beautiful  Exactly what I wanted, turned up in beautiful condition and was perfect. My boyfriend and I each have half and it helps us think of the other when we're apart. The cord it came on was small, but I cut if off and we put it on chains. Just not as pretty when you're stuck with one half and the other has disappeared, so be careful about who you split it with. <end>
 B000BBY7XE  Sterling Silver Turquoise Dream Catcher Earrings ||	  Big dreamcatcher  Everyone must have one of these...actually, there are 3 different sizes and you should get all three....wonderful, well made product <end>

 B000BC2QNQ  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 7mm Round Peridot Cubic Zirconia Post Back Stud Earrings ||	  The best!  The best earrings around! A perfect gift that went to my mother who loved them! Check out Gem Avenue for the best jewelry. They rule and if you don't have earrings from Gem Avenue then you're probably not as cool as someone who does. <end>
 B000BCF0Q6  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 7mm Round Aquamarine Cubic Zirconia Post Back Stud Earrings ||	  Perfectly Pleased.  These earrings are great. Well-made (sterling silver), yet inexpensive enough so that I don't worry about losing one. I wear them constantly, in one color or another. <end>  Real Nice  The earrings came so quickly. I was real happy to see the earrings. They are a bit big, but the blue is nice. I also purchased the sterling silver that is white. That pair is much more attractive and more sparkling than the blue. I gave it a four star because the blue is not as bright as I thought it would be. <end>
 B000BCIIDS  Sterling Silver High Polished Small 1/2" Puffed Heart, with 18" Box chain. ||	  recommend it!  this little puffed heart with 18'' box chain is great to buy. the size is just right, not too big, not too small. it's not a fancy sparkling little thing, but it goes with my daily clothes very well. my friends like it a lot too. i recommend it. <end>
 B000BCOOK4  14Kt Two Tone Etruscan Style Band ||	  Etruscan or Cleopatra Wedding Band  I received this ring about 2 weeks ago and I am very pleased with it. I liked it when I first saw it online because it was different from the norm, for im not one who is into the flashy diamond scene. Im more of a toned down type of woman. The ring is very reasonably priced and is a lot thicker than the traditional women's wedding band. I would highly recommend this type of wedding band for any woman who dares to defy the norm. On an even greater note, I am getting married November 3rd, 2007, Hooray! <end>
 B000BCOPZ8  Powerful Pentagram Cross Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  perfect  I loved it. Is everything I wanted, good size, you can use it whenever you want, it's beautiful and I love that you can make the collar longer or shorter. It's perfect! <end>  A beautiful piece of jewelry  I love this piece. It is so much prettier in person. If you are a wiccan or a christian you will love to wear this piece <end>  Great Picture, Horrible product  I purchased this necklace a few weeks ago, thinking it would go great with the rest of my collection. Instead what I received was such a piece of junk, that I would have been better off getting something out of a quarter machine at Wal-mart. The item looks nothing like the picture , and is so cheaply made that it bends like a straw.I ended up returning mine and getting a refund <end>  THIS PIECE IS JUNK  I was very disappointed when I recieved this piece of jewelry. I expected it to be a lot nicer than it was. It is not shiny at all, in fact, it is rather dull. When I opened the package the bottom point of the cross was bent and I had to bend it back but I was not able to get it straight. Some wierd gray stuff rubbed off the charm and onto my fingers. The front and back of the charm are a dull silverish color and the sides of the charm are dark gray, like they didn't even bother to cover that up. It looks like they just spray painted the front and back of the charm and left the sides bare. This jewelry looks like a cheap piece of junk, like something you would find in a kids quarter machine! Do not buy it you will not be impressed. I know I will never buy from this jeweler again.  o( <end>  junk  Ditto to what everyone else said. Totally false advertising. This is not even made of metal...it bends like some rubbery plastic. Soooooooo DISAPPOINTED! <end>  Very cheaply made product  When I first received this necklace the cross was slightly bent, and the piece itself was a very dull grey color. The detail markings looked like they were scraped on, not on par like the advertised picture showed. I didn't mind it since people wouldn't be taking a close look at it, but the first 5 minutes I wore it the cross piece fell off! Hopefully I can find the receipt and return this item. This is not "powerful" at all, more like the stuff you get from the quarter machine. <end>  2-dimensional disapointment  I can sum this up in one sentence  Flat, easily breakable piece you'd expect from a grocery store vending machine. <end>  You might be surprised..  I purchased this because it combines two of my beliefs. The only downside is it looks like plastic but clearly is not. I wish it was a bit thicker and more defined but the pentagram goes practically unnoticed which was what I was looking for. It is a bit cheap looking when you first see it but I think you will find yourself pleased in the long run. Now the seller is amazing! The necklace arrived in a secure package and the rope (chain) is very comfortable that I even sleep in it without issue. Fast shipping as well makes this a 4 star review! <end>  A waste of money  I thought that I would be getting a quality item but instead it was garbage. The material is cheap, the details were dull, the necklace was also sketchy. The material is not strong AT ALL. If you test out it's durability, you will be HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. I do not recommend purchasing this product. Next time, I'll pay a little more for something alot better. I guess you truly get what you pay for. <end>  LOVE IT  I have been looking for a cross and a pentagram, an to find the necklace with both together is awsome. I will be looking at the jelwery more often now. <end>  Awesome Necklace  I absolutely love the necklace and am looking forward to doing more buisness with this person! thank you <end>  I got this as a gift for someone  It's a good thing I really love that person or I'd have taken it back and given him something else. It looks great on him though. A really nice peice of jewlery <end>
 B000BCZYXK  14K White Gold Designer Style Ring Guard Enhancer ||	  Beautiful but didn't work for my ring  When I received the ring guard, I found that it was not suitable for my engagement ring (my ring overpowered the guard which is very dainty). Sadly, I had to return it and request a refund (JewelryDays via Amazon.com). I am waiting to receive credit back to my debit card which they say will be 10 to 14 business days.In the meantime, I found another guard thru Pompeii3 which is also an affiliate of Amazon.com, I believe. I received that purchase in good order Friday. It does not fit my ring exactly but am taking it to a jeweler after the holiday and make sure it can be adjusted properly to enhance my ring (and act as a wedding ring).I paid separately for the replacement guard so am waiting for refund on the first purchase which I am confident will be done in the time frame promised. <end>
 B000BD0C18  Sterling Silver Domed Cuff Bangle Bracelet with Rope Edge 13/16 inch wide, ||	  Gorgeous!  This was a beautiful bracelet. My son gave it to his bride for a wedding gift. He had it engraved and it was just gorgeous. <end>  Poor Quality  Bracelet does not look like picture. The picture makes the bracelet look as if it is a smooth silver surface, but when the bracelet came it was not smooth, it was lumpy. Also, very flimsy and felt as if it would be easily bent out of shape. If you are looking for a high quality bracelet this is not it. <end>  review  i bought this before Christmas for my daughter. It wasn't the exact one she wanted so i returned it, without any problem. i was very pleased with the service. <end>  great bangle  This item arrived in a very timely manner and I was very pleased with my purchase.

The colour shines bright and looks brighter than a real emerald. They are comfortable earrings to wear and a good size, not to mention a nice price too! <end>  very happy  brought a pair of real emerald earings and a fake pair.....I think she liked these a lot better!!! <end>  a good value  These earrings are the perfect size, not too big to be gaudy, but enough to dress up my ears for work, and very pretty. I also bought the "sapphire" ones too, and plan to get the "ruby" ones. You cannot beat the price $3.95 per pair, definitely worth it! <end>  Wonderful bargain  They are very pretty, wonderfully priced, better (brighter) then real emeralds, anyone would be happy with these earring as a gift or for themselves as they are not too small or too large, very comfortable, any age can wear them, just a wonderful product.Came quickly in a nice little silver box not cheap looking or tacky I would recommend this seller as these are my fourth pair of earrings from [...] in three years and have never been disappointed. <end>  Beautiful  These little studs are absolutely brilliant. They arrived in prefect condition and reasonable wrapping. They came in a nice little gift box with a packet around them. The stone quality is just as pictured and the backs were not damaged at all. Which has been a problem I've had with other studs I've purchased by mail. <end>  nice bling  I just received these in the mail and was delighted that I had purchased the ruby and sapphire color earrings as well. they are a gorgeous color green, sparkle nicely and the price was outstanding. the only thing I would change is that the posts are very short and the backs are very small for those of us with big hands. otherwise, a winner! <end>  emerald stud earrings  You couldn't beat the price for a cute stocking stuffer, so I ordered a pair for all of my 3 daughters. They came in a nice silver cardboard box and my girls are very happy with their size and appearance. <end>  sterling silver cubic zirconia stud earrings emerald green  The arrings were smaller than I had expected but I love the color and I do wear them. Would buy more when I can afford them <end>  Emerald green is Nice.  I love the color of the stone which is very bright. I had a hard time getting use to the size at first because they stick out very far from my ear lobe. It was definitely worth the price and they are truly emerald green!!! <end>  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings Emerald Green  Gave them to my niece who just recently pierced her ears. She loves them because they're small and delicate looking. <end>  My favorite color  These are a five star rating because they are a good price I liked them because they were small would recommend to anyone. <end>  Awesome Product  Got delievery super fast and quality was beyond what I expected for the price.I will buy more definantly.Stone is so brillant and setting looks very high end AMAZING!!TY!! <end>  Great Gift!  My boyfriend bought these for me as a engagement present to go along with the ring, they are amazing and they wear great! I can even sleep in them!!!!!! <end>  A GRAND SURPRISE!  i WAS LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF EMERALD EARINGS TO GIVE MY WIFE AS A "PRIVATE " SURPRISE -- SOMETHING THAT WAS A BIT OF A PRIVATE JOKE, REALLY! --- WHEN i FOUND THESE EARRINGS  i DIDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'D FOUND TO BE HONEST. WHEN THEY ARRIVED I WAS A DEAL MORE THAN DELIGHTED; WHAT WAS TO BE A JOKE PROVED TO BE SOMETHING OF GREAT WORTH....WUNDERBAR!! THE ONLY THING WAS THAT THE P&P WAS 5 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE PRESSIE...BUT REALLY, WHO THE HELL CARED.WELL DONE AMAZON! BRILLIANT!! <end>  Run away  These are as lifeless as they appear in the photo. No sparkle at all. I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase these. They did come in a timly manner. That is the only thing positive I can say. <end>

This cuff is absolutely stunning.Very comfortable to wear. Sabrina Silver is a very trustworthy company in my opinion.Their prices are far below normal retail prices and they offer products that you would not normally find in the stores.

I have had this ring for over two weeks now and it is still just as beautiful as it was the first day. I have received many compliments about it and I often find myself admiring it.I also appreciated the fast shipping. It arrived on the first day of the estimated shipping dates. Great product, great company! <end>  Hermoso  Bello anillo que va con la persona que lo adquierio"peque&ntilde;o pero como brilla!!!" jajajaGracias <end>  Admirable  I enjoy the casual comfort of this ring, and would suggest it anyone who enjoys lightweight jewelery, along with more expensive appearance. <end>  Beautiful Ring  The ring is what I thought it would be...beautiful. The only drawback for me is that the band bends easily. This ring has a unique shape to it that has drawn compliments from friends. Regardless, I would recommend this to others. <end>  Great Ring  i am so happy i bought this ring for myself... it was an excellent find. It is not too big and not to small. it's absolutly exquisit! <end>  It's just nice to have  Simple, pretty, and cheap.I bought it for myself and I'm very glad I did.  ) <end>  Very pretty ring  I bought this ring as a present and the person who received it absolutely loves it. It is very pretty and an excellent value. <end>  Nice, elegant ring  I purchased this ring because I am interested in a similar style engagement ring setting. I wanted to see in person how it would look. It is a very elegant looking, dainty ring. The stone is a little loose but that is to be expected with the type of setting and the overall look you want from this ring. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. <end>  very pleased  i was very happy with this ring it was exactly as the discription said. i would definatly recomend it. <end>  its good  I am no expert on rings, but the Zirconia looks kinda flat. Are these things supposed to look like diamonds? It is good quality though. Didn't know what the "Promise ring" stood for, so there was some rather awkward explanations when giving it to my gf. worth $20 <end>  Great Product and Great Service  I was very happy with the service and the product. I received my ring very quickly. The ring is beautiful. Everyone that sees it makes some comment about it and wants to know where I got it. I plan on making future purchases with Gem Avenue! <end>  great value  This is a very nice ring and is an even better price. It could be used as a promsie ring or just a ring to give to someone or to buy yourself. The style of the ring is unique and amazing. I love it, or should I say my girlfriend loves it. <end>  very nice ring  this is a great promise ring, i bought it for my self b/c i love rings like this, but can def. be used as a promise ring just like it says ) <end>  Poor  I bought this ring and the diamond fell out the first day I got it ,It's a beautiful ring other then that <end>  Ring  sharp looking ring and the price is right. fits just like i wanted and on the finger that i wanted it to <end>  This product is Fantastic!  This is an amazing item. The beauty in it is simply stunning. Highly polished, the stone has amazing clarity. Simply put, Great Purchase! <end>  Better than hoped for!  I ordered this ring because my 5 months pregnant fingers stopped fitting into my size 4.5 wedding ring a long time ago. I had been wearing a cheap ring I bought on clearance at Target (simply because I did not want to walk around without a ring on that finger, especially while pregnant!), but the silver color was turning bronzeish after only a few weeks. I finally got online and ordered this ring to wear until I could fit into my wedding ring again. I just did see the point of spending a ton of money on a ring I'd only wear for a few months, but at the same time, wanted something that looked halfway decent. I was SO pleasantly surprised to see this ring. It is gorgeous, slender, and very delicate, but does not look too small or cheap. I ordered a 7.5 because the size 7 I bought at Target fit well, but I wanted room for those last few weeks of pregnancy and finger swelling. It is huge on me, but will hopefully fit well as I get bigger. So glad to have purchased this! <end>  Good quality for price  I like the design, and definitely worth the money! The delivery was prompt as well. It got scratched up a bit after a month of wearing, but that happens to any jewelry  ) <end>  Great!  Ring is great, looks just like advertised, and very beautiful. The price makes on skeptical, but it looks good and fits well.Gem Aavenue was also great, postal service lost my package, and they not only kept in contact with me, but sent me a new one free of charge. Great service, great product, and I would definitely recommend it. <end>  Love it!  LOVE IT. Got it as a gift and am infatuated with it because it looks good, it fits well, and it's not so expensive that I'm scared to wear it out. (I often take my rings off for things and I always fear I'll forget to put them back on. But this one is pretty and inexpensive enough that I can wear it with confidence.)So far, it holds together well through hand washings and daily use, but it's only been a little over two weeks since I got it. Should anything happen, I will return and update!Overall  A worthwhile buy! <end>  Worth the price  This ring is definately worth the affordable price. It is by no means a high dollar looking ring. It is delicate and pretty, but I'm sure it will wear out with time. But still, a really great option for that special girl you want to show your affection towards. <end>  very nice  i really liked the ring and so did my girlfriend only thing is that the prongs were very sharp, not really smoothed out at all <end>  Nice Ring  The ring was not exactly as I imagined it to be. The picture made the stone look like it has a purple tint to it. The stone is completely colorless. The band is a little daintier than I thought it would be as well, but it doesn't matter if you have slender fingers. The person I got this for loves it so I'm very happy with this ring. <end>  promise ring  I bought this for my granddaughter. She loved it, but it was a little large forher finger. <end>  Beautiful, cost effective!  Will this ring last 100 years? I'm not completely sure, but it sure is a great deal for its price. It's beautiful, and let me give a gift to my fiancee that didn't break the bank. Since we are experiencing intense family drama, often centered around money and the lust for more, we like that it's a cheap and powerful signal to certain people that we can see real beauty beyond dollar signs. She loves it.  ) <end>  Siver Ring  Beautiful ring Delivered promptly and in a lovely silver bag. I'm already wearing and enjoying it. I would definately order from this seller again. Thanks. <end>  Beautiful, but breakable  This is a beautiful ring- I had it as a purity ring for about a year and got many compliments on it! However, it is frankly pretty cheap. The metal soon got bent out of shape, and the CZ fell out after a year. I really enjoyed it while it lasted though- it was only $10 so I wasn't expecting too much. In short, its a gorgeous ring- but don't expect it to last too long! <end>  Just a Review  I may not be too ken into these kinds of things, but when the name of the ring is "Marvelous" it really is marvelous; it is definitely a very nice gift to give to a girl. Not THE perfect ring, but does a very good job of doing whatever job you want it to make.The thickness of the ring seem just right, which doesn't make it uncomfortable to wear, and the width of the ring is not annoying-sized as you would see in some other rings. The design also is very simple yet not bothersome to the eyes (although in the contrary, very smooth surface and a pretty neat design); it doesn't stand out too much either, which is good in my opinion. <end>  Great!  My girlfriend loved it, a little smaller and more petite than I expected, but great none the less! <end>  Excellent !!!!  The ring is absolutely perfect!!It looks like in the photo,plus that the little stone sparkles a lot!!;) It's so chic,I love it!!I absolutely recommend it if you don't like huge and extravagant things...It's perfect for all the hours of the day!Get it now,you will love it too!!! <end>  Sterling Silver Promise Ring  Absolutely beautiful and elegant--looks and wears like a ring that would cost well over $200 - $300.00 Dignified ring, sparkling cubic zirconia that no one would know was not a real diamond (except a jeweler). Completely thrilled with this ring. <end>  Ring  I opened the box and when I saw the ring I was delighted. It is beautiful and every time I look at it great memories come to mind  ) loved the ring! <end>  Sterling Silver CZ Solitaire  I absolutely love this ring. It is so delicate and pretty! I've worn this ring daily since I got it, and it's in great shape. The little boxes the rings from this seller are sent in are precious!Definitely a great value. <end>  Just to say I love you.  My wife was hinting to wanting a new ring. I searched online and in jewelery stores for something that i thought she'd like. After weeks of looking, I was looking on amazon.com for something for myself, and some how came across this ring. It was perfect. The right price and everything. The shipment was sent immediately. I can't wait to do business with Gem Avenue again. <end>  great ring  I hate being solicited for reviews, which I was by the seller once I received the ring, but I must say it is a good ring. The ring looks just as it does online, if not better. The cubic zirconia is cut just right and it is supersparkly and passes pretty well for a real diamond from afar. It seems pretty sturdy to me -- I have been wearing it for the last week and I am not a gentle person. The stone has stayed in place and so far, repeated washing of my hands with the ring on hasn't caused any problems. My finger has not turned green, and this ring is a cute little thing good for wimpy little fingers like my own. The price is great, and I would definitely recommend it. I'm a miser with my money and so I think this was the perfect purchase and it was well worth the small cost. I have no regrets. <end>  Pretty, but cheap  I have had this ring for 2 weeks, of which I have worn it about 4 days. There is no way this ring is sterling silver. After the first day of wear, my finger turned green. After the fourth day, it appeared so tarnished it was ridiculous and the ring has totally bent. I almost couldn't get it off my finger it is so misshapen. And before anyone asks, no I didn't wear it doing anything that would have caused it to bend. I sit at a desk all day and type for my job and I am usually on the computer most of the night at home. I wear tons of sterling silver rings and I have never had such a bad experience with one. Yes, the ring is very cute, but it is inexpensive for a reason... it will last about a week. <end>  Beautiful little ring  This is a beautiful little ring. I bought it for my girl friend as a nice present. Small, simplistic, inexpensive yet elegant-appearing is what I wanted and that is what I got. This is the perfect ring for someone who works a lot since it wouldn't be a big deal it they broke or lost it. <end>  my review  I bought a number of rings from you & every one was beautiful not all of them were for myself but the ones that were fit perfectly loved them thank you <end>  Nice  This is a nice ring...my sister got it for Christmas and she loves it!&lt;a target="_blank" href="http //www.bigcrumbs.com/crumbs/landing.do?r=lyriq74&s;=3438">&lt;/a> <end>  Awesome!  I was very please not only with the service I received but the ring itself. It is beautiful! I am very please and would recommend it to anyone! <end>  I really didn't like it  I had a little shipping problem(no fault of the seller) and waited a long time for this ring. I was disappointed when I opened the box. It looks cheap to me. The setting for the stone is cheapo...not the band, but the metal the stone is actually set in. I've had it 2 years and have only worn it twice. It may work for a teenager. The band itself is nice and the stone size is small, just the way I wanted it. It has never tarnished. I know it was inexpensive, but it looks that way too....at least to me. Gem Avenue does sell some of the best snake chains I have ever seen in sterling. They are very durable and require little cleaning and they do not tarnish...period. I had mine for 2 years and wear them often. They are inexpensive, but very well made and good looking. <end>  nice ring  The ring was delivered fast, and my girlfriend loves it, even though I hope to break up with her sometime soon. She's a mooch and not very bright. All of our friend think we should break up. Plus, both of us have probably cheated on each other a few times. <end>  cheap item  Just a cheap item. We bought it for fun. Do not expect anything for the quality, otherwise you will get very disappointed. <end>  Pretty Ring  I got exactly what the picture looks like. It is of good quality. I have been showering with it and it has not turned my finger green, which means it is real silver. It was shipped quickly as well. <end>  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT  Worst piece of garbage I have ever bought not worth buying unless the person you but it for is under 10 I wanted to give zero stars but it wouldnt let me this product is horrible <end>  Patricia  This was a very pretty ring, but after getting it wet we realized that it is only glued into the setting, and so we lost the stone. I felt very bad since I had given it to my daughter for her birthday. She really loved it. I caution others not to get it wet or to shop more carefully! <end>  Cubic Zirconia is a girls best friend??  This ring is a good buy. It is shiny and pretty and everything a girl needs to make her eyes sparkle.. for about 16 bucks. Since it is sterling silver, it WILL mold to your finger...making it funny shaped, but everyone knows, or should know that anyway! If you are expecting diamonds and white gold, dig a little deeper into your wallets ladies, and buy real diamonds and white gold. This really is a beautiful ring, I like mine so much, I bought one for my Grandma as well.. the sizes do run a little small, so make sure you take that into consideration.. <end>  It's sooo cute!!  Great quality and so pretty, i love wearing this ring! It arrived promptly and just makes me smile looking at it! I will definately purchase from this vendor again!!! <end>  Good Item  Was a good item, exactly what I ordered.I found something I liked better at another shop, actually the seller of this ring. Gem Ave. They have a lot of cool stuff there. <end>  Lovely...  The other reviews say it all. This ring is only cheap when it comes to price. Is it going to last a lifetime? No. But it does great at what it's for, to show someone you care about them. This ring is gorgeous and looks much more expensive than it is. No issues after first month with the stretching that some people have mentioned, size was accurate. I'll probably just order another if we have any issues down the road. <end>  Beautiful  This ring is beautiful i got it for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it, it is the exact style that she likes nice and simple and I recommend it to anyone without a doubt this ring should make anybody who receives it very happy, shipping was fast and just when it was supposed to come. <end>  Excellent quality, on time delivery!  My sister chose this ring to buy for herself and was absolutely elated. Good quality, exactly as pictured, all in all - great value! Would not hesitate to recommend... <end>  So cute  I've had this ring for months and still get lots of compliments on it. I never take it off and it's been beaten up pretty good, but still shines and hasn't turned my finger green or anything. It's so affordable that if it were to ever break I'd no doubt purchase a new one. The size of the diamond is perfect, doesn't look too small or too big on my hand. <end>  Love it!  I bought this item because it looks just like my original engagement ring. My now husband gave this ring to me as an engagement ring at a rough time in my life. Some things happened and he decided to pawn that ring to get me a "better" ring. I was upset to lose my 1st engagement ring because of the sentimental value. I found this and literally jumped for joy. I ordered it, received it fast and it looks just like the the pic! Thank you Amazon. <end>  For the price  For the price, you cant really get much better than this. It looks nice and can fool any onlooker into believing that it is real. Has a good heft to it to for its size, it feels well made. <end>  nervous but happy  i think this ring is elegant and beautifully designed. my cz is extra sparkly and no sharp, pointy ends to the silver. finished perfectly. so many people say the ring twists and the cz falls out that i was afraid to order this ring. i am glad i did. i am ever so careful taking it off and on because of the bad reviews. i really love this one and will be extremely gentle with it and hope it stays together. it doesn't seem to be easily bent though. if it falls apart at least i will enjoy it in the meantime. <end>  good for one night  i got this ring so people wouldn't "hit" on me. i received it the first day it was expected and it came in a really cute box. i put it on immediately and wore it to work. i've had it for about three days now and i noticed it was fitting really weird. i took it off and its shape was completely distorted. it bends very easily. i took it off and put it on my key ring. i should have known better, because its so cheap. its really pretty, but only for about a night. then it bends like it was made from aluminum foil. <end>  Great, inexpensive ring  This ring was purchased as a surprise gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. Definitely doesn't look like the price, I was very impressed with the quality. Obviously this isn't a of engagement quality but it definitely does the job for a surprise gift or anniversary. The price can't be beat for the quality of this product. I will be buying from this seller again and the shipping was lightning fast! <end>  beautiful ring  I just got my ring today and it is more beauiful in person than i had inmagine and the stone is perfect and shine in the sun oh and the shipping fast will be order from this company again <end>  Love it 2  I love my rings and wear them to work where I repair furniture and have had no problem with durability of any of the rings I bought from Gem Avenue. I will be buying more. <end>  shes happy  the person i got the ring for is happy so id say this product and seller are very good and reliable <end>  Great  This ring is beautiful. I bought this ring about a year and a half ago. You get what you buy, the ring is cheap and the quality is too. Also, the ring is a little deformed now and the stone just fell out one day. BUT because I loved the actual design of the ring (regardless of the above mentioned malfunctions) I am currently ordering a second. No color flaws, No chipping, No turning your finger a color. Looks amazing on and recieved multiple compliments. I mean...its 9 dollars. Enjoy it while it lasts. <end>  Love it!  This is a fun ring! It's simple and has held up under the daily abuse I put my hands through on a regular basis. I am really enjoying it! <end>  Good for the price  This is a good ring for the price. The diamond does not shine as it looks in the photo. The quality is in par with the price. <end>  ring  diamond fell out in 3 weeks... very cheap... but for the price i wasent very disapointed <end>  A beautiful, simple ring  This ring may be on the "cost effective" side of things, but it doesn't matter  it is beautiful. The thin band is very comfortable, and the cubic zirconia is exactly the right size and shape for this setting. I think this is a ring that any girl would love. It works well as a promise ring, a "thinking about you a lot" ring, or just an "I still like you" ring. The price is low, but with a ring this pretty, it really doesn't matter. <end>  Fast Amazing Service  I bought this ring for one of my female friends. It was shipped and I arrived it 4 days before they said it would be there and when I opened the package the ring was breathtaking. Awesome service fast delivery would defiantly buy from again. <end>  Great Ring!!  The ring was very beautiful...i thought the price might mean the ring would look cheap but it doesnt at all...its a great product for the price and the company was amazing to work with.. <end>  tarnished  I gave this a 5 star rating 1 year ago, but the ring tarnished and the silver coating wore off in a year. My daughter loved it, but I am disappointed that it did not hold up better. The design is beautiful and we had no problems with the stone falling out like the other reviewer. <end>  nice ring  I bought this ring from Amazon over a year ago. It is still pretty, although very slightly worn out - as it usually happens with low-cost silver.It am satisfied and I would buy it again.The worst review here claims that this made her finger turn green and it bent within a week. NOTHING like that happened to me.Sterling silver is 7.5 percent copper which can turn green, and some people seem to have body chemistry that's prone to staining. This happens if a person is on the "sweaty" side and has a natural high acidity level. Another reason may be reaction with lotions and some chemicals. <end>  Beware of falling (tiny and fake) rocks  I liked it, until the stone fell out. If you look at how the ring is constructed, the stone is just sitting between the two metal arms. That mean if one gets twisted or pulled, out goes the stone.It wasn't worth the money to send it back.I guess you get what you pay for. <end>  It's a really pretty ring  This rign is really nice. I bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. It arrived quickly and safely and it even came in a neat little gift box. <end>  Unbelievable!!!  This ring could be mistaken for a diamond, i've had 3 people say they want it. I bought it for myself because i never got a "promise" ring from anyone, and if i had a daughter, this would definately be a a gift i would get her for an important occasion. It's that beautiful!!!! <end>  LOVE IT!  EDITED (3 x)I RECEIVED this ring from my BF for our 6 month anniversary as a promise ring and I absolutely love it!SINCE THE REVIEW ABOVE, the stone fell out of the ring. I edited my review because I wanted to warn future shoppers what happened to my ring.THIS LAST EDIT is to give thanks to this company for their great customer service. After the negative (edited) review, they were kind enough to replace the broken ring FREE OF CHARGE. Thanks! <end>  it looks cute but some part are damage  it looks pretty cute when i open it. but when i look clearly through it, there are some damages. scratches, band, etc. even that, i still would like to order it again for size 6. overall, it's a great gift to any females. im pretty sure they'd love it. <end>
 B000BDA3U8  Small Celtic Knot Sun Cross with Emerald Green Glass Pendant and 18" Sterling Silver Necklace ||	  To small  The chain and medallion are way to small you can barely see the medallion when you have it on <end>  Not Worth the Price  When view in person, this pendant looks cheap and poorly-made. It would be best suited as toy jewelry for very young kids to play with. <end>

 B000BDGXXY  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 10mm Square Shaped Aquamarine Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish 2mm Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  review pf blue cz ring  The ring is good quality. It has a nice shine and feels good on my finger. I would highly recommend it. <end>  Great service  I love it !!!!!!Great Service. It was sent out ontime amd just a shown in the picture. I had a ring just like this one as a girl and somebody robbed it from my home. I am so happy i found this ring and such great servie. I would order from them again. <end>  More than expected!  I love this ring! I was about to buy a ring that look excatly the same from another website for $400 that was white gold instead of sterling sliver and had real diamonds instead of cz, but after comparing both of the pictures I bought this one. I am so glad I did. It is beautiful and you cannot tell it is not the $400 ring. <end>  Sparkly & Fun  Ring looks great. Blue stone is nice color and clear. Band is delicate and sparkly. Very fun for a great price. Recommended. <end>  Aquamarine Ring  I ordered the Aquamarine ring for my daughter for Christmas. It is beautiful. She wears this ring every day and treasures it. I plan on ordering another Aquamarine ring in a different style for her birthday. <end>  FINALLY! MY PERFECT BIRTHSONE RING!  This is high quality, sparkling and true to aquamarine actual color-it arrived very quickly,in mint condition. I love the ring and will continue to shop this dealer. <end>  WOW!!!  What a beautiful ring! Much nicer than I could ever have imagined for the price. Will buy from them over-and-over again. Amazing quality and detail! <end>  Recommendation  The ring was packaged very quickly. Not only was the packaging very secure, Gem Avenue was even considerate enough to gift wrap it in a very cute heart shaped box! The ring was sent as described. It arrived in flawless condition and it is so beautiful! I will definitely order from Gem Avenue again. <end>  not as good as the picture  This does not look as good as the picture would lead you to believe. Honestly I think some of these reviews are fakes. It is an OK ring but the picture is misleading. <end>  This Was Bad  Item was never received despite the several excuses and promises. A refund was issued by Amazon <end>  Cute.  I got what I ordered.It looks like the picture. They gave me the time of Dec 20-24th We got it on the last day,I didn't got to look at it untill this morning when she opened it.It can by reg mail. If you order this ring order very well in advance of the time you need it. <end>  cheap but good !  got this for my girl friend came quick the pre rapped box was very nice i give 5 stars good peice! <end>  not the best  I like the ring but it is not the best. the stone was a pretty blue but not aquamarine. looked more like a very dull blue topaz. the ring was not a true size five ring. it came at a 5 1/2. and please don't try to wear this ring everyday. keep in box and wear at special occassions. i wore it for three days straight and that third day the prongs holding the gemstone in place were all bent up. pretty ring though. <end>  Grad's ring  I got this ring for my sister-in-law when she graduated from high school. Up on receiving it in the mail it looks just like the picture! That made me happy! She loves the ring and never takes it off! As far as I know it's still holding up and looking great! <end>  Exactly what I ordered  This product is exactly what I ordered and it even came earlier than expected ... The product was exactly as it was pictured and the box that it came in was adorable. I will be ordering from them again.... <end>  It is more beautiful than I expected  I received this ring yesterday and it is more beautiful than I expected. I love it and it was a steal at this price. It is really worth the purchase. <end>  Cubic Zirconia Aquamarine  I absolutely love this ring! It is really flashy, but it's gorgeous! I don't like the little "diamond" accents though. It just looks like plastic, but then again, it's all about the Aquamarine cubic zirconia. It's absolute adorable! <end>  So pretty!!!  I love this ring. It was kind of a Christmas present to myself and I am so glad I bought it. What a great price and I received it so quickly. Very happy with my purchase. The stone is a good size and it's very well made. <end>  So pretty!  This is one of my favorite rings that I own right now and its such good quality. <end>  Beautiful!!  This ring is absolute beautiful! Since I have had this ring, I've received numerous compliments on it. If you want a ring to go with anything, definitely get this ring. You will love it. <end>  Sterling Silver Band Aquamarine  It's beautiful! I love it and it looks even better than the picture. <end>  very nice  i have had my ring now for over a month and it still looks as good as the first day i received it. Every so often though, it needs to be cleaned with a little soap and water so that it still shines. <end>  BEAUTIFULL  THIS IS A VERY NICE RING, THE STONE HAS A BEAUTIFULL COLOR AND THE CZ SHINES A LOT!!!!! <end>  What I expected  This ring is just what I expected. I think it's a good value for what I paid. I was hoping for it to be darker than a genuine aquamarine, and it was. This is more like the color of blue topaz. The only downside to the ring is that the center stone is "flat". It is a simple cut, with not a lot of facets, so it doesn't really sparkle or catch the light. Still I am happy with it. I bought it to match a dress I was wearing on a cruise and it did. And I couldn't find anything like this in the department stores as far as fashion jewelry goes. <end>  Sent it back  I received this ring, along with two others, from Gem Avenue today. I had ordered from Gem Avenue previously and was very happy with the quality of that ring for the price I paid. Unfortunately, the quality of this one didn't match up.The aquamarine stone had no sparkle or shine to it. Even though it was an inexpensive ring, I expected more from Gem Avenue and in fact, I paid less for one of the other rings in today's shipment and it's much nicer.This one went back. <end>  Nice piece for costume jewelry  The picture was very nice. The actual product a little bigger than anticipated. All in all a nice piece of fun costume jewelry. I enjoy it. <end>  i love my birthstone ring  i love the ring its the first birthstone ring i have ever had it fits great and goes with all my outfits. <end>  Not the color of aquamarine  I bought this ring in the citrine, for my daughter's birthstone, and in the aquamarine, for my son's birthstone.While the Citrine version was absolutely beautiful and sparkly and beyond my expectations, this aquamarine one was a total disappointment. It looks like blue topaz, a stone I do not like very much. Aquamarine is a lighter, more airy color of blue with bits of green. The stone had absolutely no sparkle at all, very very dull. The same holds true for the matching square stud earrings I ordered. Very dull and not the right color. I will be sending both the ring and the earrings back. <end>  Alright Ring for good price!!!  This is a great ring but a poor price. Do not be fooled by the photo. When I received the ring I was a little surprised by the poor craftsmanship. The center stone was set secure, but some of the side stones were slightly out of line with the others. Also the design in the side of the ring was not consistent. Overall I would give this ring for the price a 3 because as sad as it is I have seen better quality rings at Wal-mart for less. Personally, had I seen the ring in a store, I wouldn't have paid more than ten dollars for it. Just so you know in defence of the ring. Still today 14 months after buying it, no stones have fallen out, and it has yet to be cleaned and shines like crazy. <end>  Gorgeous  This is a gift for my daughter, She is going to love it as I do!! The picture doesn't do it justice!! <end>

 B000BFNRRC  NFL Logo Silver Double Gem Belly Ring - Seattle Seahawks ||	  Excellent buy, very attractive belly ring  The quality was excellent for the price. The gems have nice sparkle, noticeable from a distance. The same style ring at a shop was well over $50. I bought it for my wife, and it was the first ring she has had, it was used for the first piercing and she has had no trouble with it for 4 weeks now. It is surgical steel so it can be used for piercing, where other silver rings couldn't be used (don't be confused by the title that the seller has used, it's not silver it is high quality surgical steel) <end>
 B000BGNBAY  Pearl and rose quartz choker, 'Ethereal' ||	  pretty, simple, & feminine  The pearls in this necklace vary from white, to pink, to peach, to beige. It is not nearly as pink as I hoped it'd be, but the upside is that the color range is so neutral you'll be able to wear it with anything. I don't really care for the clear fish-line that makes up the string of this necklace. What I do like though, is the fact that the stones are woven on in a way that makes them quite 3D....some stand up and some lean down, and you get a lot of movement in it as you go about your activities. So it does have an artful appeal even if the design is a bit simple. Since I think it's quite a bit more interesting than the usual plain strand of pearls, it'll make a nice addition to my necklace wardrobe. Just be aware that this is more of a subtle piece and not a "knock-out" design. <end>  Gorgeous!  As usual, this piece from Novica did not disappoint. Beautiful and delicate, yet well-made! <end>

This one is very nice as are the others that match what I actually ordered. The company, however, sent one incorrect link and was completely unwilling to admit the error or to rectify the error.

 B000BGV0SE  Pugster Dangle Golden Trumpet Italian Charms ||	  It's Totally Kitty  I have various kitty things on a key chain and this is my latest addition. It was too adorable to pass up. It arrived quickly, as pictured. Only concern I'll have will be over the "kitty crossing" dangle. I fear it may end up in the bottom of my purse one of these days because it's thin and attached only by a single unwelded loop. Otherwise, it's just adorable. <end>

 B000BGV6T2  Rose Pink Rhinestone and Lucite Flower Drops Necklace and Earrings Gift Boxed Set ||	  Stunning piece of jewelry  This set is very pretty, elegant and classy.

The necklace comes with a lobster claw clasp and a few inches (about 3) of extra loop so you can hook it to the loop of your choice and make the necklace shorter or longer. Pair this with your favorite black cocktail dress and you will look stunning.P.S.Item came giftboxed in a beautiful pink box with bow for free <end>

It even came with an authentic handwritten postcard from Bali! Overall a wonderful shopping experience! <end>
 B000BGWWUE  Silver choker, 'Zigzag Lace' ||	  Beautiful for Everyday or an Evening Out  You can see the style of the necklace in the picture, so I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not it suits your tastes. Personally, I really like this choker and I feel it is simple and subtle enough for everyday wear, yet elegant enough for those times I feel like dressing up.The choker is very solidly constructed and is well made. It has a good, heavy feel, yet sits quite comfortably on my neck and never pinches me. I even fall asleep in it sometimes, and I do not worry about breaking it. The silver has not tarnished on me yet, and I've had it for about a year.All in all, I really like this necklace and feel it adds something different to my jewelry collection. I saw it a couple of years ago, decided not to buy it, and then regretted my decision when it became unavailable. When I saw it again much later, I bought it immediately and I'm glad I did! <end>

Indeed, in ancient Mesopotamia, it was considered the queen of gemstones, and was highly sought after for jewelry. Now is your opportunity to own a piece of lapis jewelry for yourself!These handsome earrings are lapis, with 14k gold posts, and look very attractive. They look excellent with formal, semi-formal, and even informal outfits. Plus, the less you are wearing, the more important jewelry is, and these earrings always look great. I love these earrings, and highly recommend them! <end>
 B000BHW2C6  Surgical Steel Domed 8mm Wedding Band Ring Gothic Cross, sizes 7 - 14 ||	  Great ring  I was very happy with this ring, it was much nicer on the finger than in a photo too. Very impressed. Thanks  ) <end>  Happy Customer  I like the ring. My actually size is 13 but I have a friend that fits 12. He absolutely loved it. So, I ordered my correct size and I love that it came quickly !!!!! And the price is super as well !!! Can't beat it !! I'm really happy with this retailer !!! ( Oh and I'll be ordering from Sabrina again soon ) <end>  title for my review  I really like this ring. The section with the cross in the middle actually slides out. I like to play with it when I'm bored. The quality is decent but it does get all scratched up, so I just wear it the same way to keep the outer surface nice. <end>  great ring  My boyfriend totally loves this ring. I didn't expect such a fast delivery, and the ring looks awesome. <end>  Now it's USELESS !  About a couple weeks after i purchased this ring for my husband, the cross design on the inside fell out. He tried to put it back in but now it is soo loose that it just falls right back out. He has tried to wear it without the cross but he can't. When the cross is not inside the ring, the are where the cross is supposed to be is soo soft that it squeezes together and misshapes the ring. Please don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful ring but his was apparently defective. Everytime he takes the ring off the cross flies to the ground. The cross itself is very sharp around the edges. Hope others have better luck ! <end>  Great men's ring  Came just as promised, and as an added bonus the packing was great for a gift. <end>  Beautiful  This ring is a must have. Love it, love it, love it!!! It is shiny and looks expensive, but it's not. It's comfortable to wear. I can only say one bad thing about it. It needs to come in smaller sizes, for example 5 or 6. <end>  Hot  my only wish on this ring is- I wish the cut potrion went all the way around the ring. Other than that a great very comfortable ring. <end>  Great ring for the price  Very nice ring, well made. The size runs a little small so I would suggest getting one size larger than your normal ring size. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the slightly small size. <end>  love the ring!!!  The ring is great, is and the price is even better. I saw the same ring on other websites for over $20, so you really can't beat it. <end>  Looks cool but too much maintenance for a ring  This ring looks very cool! The only drawback is that the cross design is actually a separate piece of the ring and it pops out whenever the ring is removed. This also tends to make the ring a little less than comfortable at times. When the cross design insert is removed the ring becomes weaker as it bends easier. In general I guess it's a pretty nice looking ring, but I don't wear it that much because of the little annoyances. Hard to complain though when the price is so nice. Definitely worth the price!  ) <end>  excellent quality  when it comes to buying things I am very picky. I searched the interenet like crazy to find a nice good quality cross ring. This is Money Well Spend, excellent product and I love it. I wish Sabrina could design some more beautiful rings. 100% recomend it. just perfect. <end>  Gothic  well made and polished steel ring. very good crisp etching. fits and looks like it was made for my hand. <end>  Very Satisfied  Was very satisfied with the delivery and item. Received in good time and nicely presented. Fine quality item. <end>  Awesome Ring  Great ring. Fits great. Wonderful quality. Would suggest this to anyone. Supplier shipped it fast (3-4 days it was at my mail box!)...in the middle of December. <end>  Not crazy about the cutout cross...  I didn't realize when I bought this that the cross was a separate piece. Unlike the other reviewers, I haven't jacked with mine, so it looks the same as it did the day I bought it (nearly a month later), but I dont' like the idea that it can bend or distort contrary to the rest of the ring.I would be happier with the cross simply carved into the ring. <end>  Very cool new design  For some reason this showed up in my recommended list, and was right up my alley, so I ordered one.I need to explain the 4 star review first. I only give 5 stars to something that is near perfect. The ring is very unique and well built, but it's not perfect. I would have given it 4.5 stars, if possible, but you don't get that option.The ring fits well, the cutout slides out hard at first, but once it's removed, it moves easier. It also does not fall out while being worn, since it covers about 2/3 of the ring, it really can't go anywhere. But as another reviewer noted, the thin line that connects the two crosses can be squeezed shut when the middle piece is removed. It can be reopened easily enough. The edges of the cut out are fairly sharp, probably sharp enough to have to watch out for.Since the "spinner" rings are now kind of old news, this is a nice new idea. <end>  My husband loves this ring  I bought this ring for my fiance at the time and I gave it to him for Christmas, which was a few days before we got married. He absolutely loves the ring and wears it all the time! This ring is so cool because you can take out the cross part and leave it to show skin or keep the cross in and it is really beautiful detailing. My husband wears this ring everyday! <end>  Love it love it!!  Surgical steel is one of the few metals that don't irritate my skin. This design was just gorgeous. Really beautiful and easy to see. <end>  camolot  good for ren-fest best for a king or queen to reactmet of camolt. and it good for those that are hard on jewlery <end>  CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP  When I firs got this ring ( earlier than the delivery date whichwas good ) I noticed that it looked a little cheap and the inner cross was not connected to the ring and fell out. The ring was a little tight, even though I know I am a size 9 ring from many other purchases. I decided to keep it, being cheap and all, but was going to take it off because it matched nothing I currently wore. When I wet my finger and tried to pull the ring off, the ring broke. right down the center, right out of the box. Seriously, spend the 18$ and get a tungston ring from world jewelry center....they dont break. <end>  Satisfied Ring Owner  I am extremely satisfied with my ring. The price was good, the shipping was fast and inexpensive. The fit is great. I wear this ring daily for over a month now. My friends have even commented how they like it. I would purchase this ring again if something happened to it. <end>  Beautiful!!!  Great looking ring, my boyfriend loved it. Made with good taste and well detailed. Great purchase! <end>  love it!  we bought these rings to rededicate our marriage. I also purchased a separate ring with a 5mm CZ that looks great with this ring! looks and feels great on your hand! <end>  Stamped cross ring  This ring arrived with poor stamping of the crosses. They were stamped with part of the cross hanging down inside. Took it too a jeweler and they hammered it back into the ring. My wife loves the ring and wears it all the time now. <end>
 B000BI1QCM  Makassar ebony choker, 'Oriental Cross' ||	  Not bad...but not as petite as you would think.  I bought this for some chick I was seeing, I thought it would be a nice little necklace, it turned out to be larger than I thought. In case you date Sasquach stay away. <end>
 B000BID8K0  Pugster Handmade Indian Agate Stone Chip Bracelets ||	  Indian Stone Bracelet  Arrived on time in perfect condition. you can definitely tell it is brand new because the plastic cord it comes on is very tight when you get it... just pull it a little, get it "broken in". I imagine over time the cord will break, but I will just keep the beads and make another bracelet from them. Very pretty, and I am satisfied with my order and the service I received. <end>
 B000BIPHW2  Pugster Green Heart Lampwork Glass ||	  Mum loves it!  Got this for my mum. She wears it on a gold ribbon and loves it to bits! It actually has a far greater gold sheen on it than this picture illustrates <end>
 B000BIPI08  Pugster Sterling Silver Fresh Water Pearl Pendant Necklace ||	  Lovely pendant  The pendant is beautiful. The description omits the measurements and when I called Pugster, they were unable to help me. I took a chance and ordered it anyhow. I'm glad that i did. Very nice quality. I took some measurements and the pearl is approx. 8-9mm with the total pendant length being 1.5cm. <end>
 B000BIUAQU  Pink Acrylic Black-Red Sexy Logo Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Cracks easily, but the price makes that irrelevant  There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points - End stays screwed on relatively well- WILL crack if you bite on the balls accidentally- Does not irritate or inflame tongue- Not uncomfortable to wear <end>
 B000BIUBBE  White and Black Gothic Cross Logo Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Decent Quality Metal Piercing Jewelry  There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points - End stays screwed on relatively well- Nice quality; not easily damaged- Does not irritate or inflame piercing- Not uncomfortable to wear <end>
 B000BIUBX2  Black Checker Ball Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Cracks easily, but the price makes that irrelevant  There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points - End stays screwed on relatively well- WILL crack if you bite on the balls accidentally- Does not irritate or inflame tongue- Not uncomfortable to wear <end>
 B000BIVSLQ  Red Acrylic Skull and Crossbones Logo Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Cracks easily, but the price makes that irrelevant  There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points - End stays screwed on relatively well- WILL crack if you accidentally bite the plastic; very brittle- Does not irritate or inflame piercing- Not uncomfortable to wear <end>
 B000BIVTBK  Photo Inlay Skull Logo Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Nice ring  I've had a few tongue rings and this one, unlike alot, you don't have to keep tightening it. It stays tight. Looks great. <end>
 B000BIVTQK  Clear AURORA BALL Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Cute for a few hours.....  I really love this because it looks pretty in the light with the "pearlized" style...however....after eating and brushing your teeth the pearl like stuff comes off and its just clear. The same goes for the colored ones like this...I put the red one in this morning and now its just plain red with no different color....kinda sucks <end>
 B000BIXJJU  Rainbow Jawbreaker Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  rainbow tongue ring  I love this tongue ring. It's not a metal that I'm allergic to so I can wear it all the time and not have to worry about anything going wrong. It arrived pretty quickly after it was sent. I really appreciated the bubble wrap packaging it was in. I would definetly buy more. <end>  You get what you pay for  I bought this a while ago. After 2 weeks of using it, the balls broke and I threw it in the trash. I would not recommend anyone to buy this, and if they really want body jewelry, they should spend a little more money for a better quality. <end>
 B000BIXKLW  Single PINK DICE Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  satisfied  arrived before estimated date. many previous orders from this seller which always are on time and in excellent condition <end>
 B000BIY6LA  Sterling & Natural Black Onyx Pendant Necklace ||	  Excellent, but tangles hair  Excellent product but it catches and tangles my longer hair. I still wear it because I like it and it looks great with my outfits. <end>
 B000BIZNNA  Yes and No Hologram Logo Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Cute  This is so cute and fun. I get alot of attention from it. When someone ask a question Im like "Read My Tongue." <end>
 B000BJPZ96  Fleur de Lis Mini Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Cheap Junk  I have now ordered a total of 3 pairs of these. They are dainty and cute. BUT---Every single time the Fleur de Lis just breaks off. They are so cute, but who wants a pair of earrings that are made so cheaply - and for almost $30. Come on Eve's Addiction - don't say you sell quality! <end>
 B000BKS6Z0  Sterling Silver Engagement or Wedding Band Ring Set with a 2.75ct Emerald-Cut CZ and Baguette Accents(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Turns very quick  I bought this ring and within a week it started to turn,have all these marks on it that looked like the silver was going to peel off.The lines are all still on the ring and you cant get rid of them and my finger is always green now if i wear them.I wouldnt suggest this product to anyone.Yes its beautiful when you first get it but you wont be satisfied in a week.... <end>
 B000BKS704  Sterling Silver Black Leather 22" Cord Chain Necklace ||	  not what I hoped for  I purchased and received 3 leather and sterling silver cords to hang my families crosses on them. Everyone of them fell apart out of the package. Not very good quality, not worth the money, but shipping them back would have added to their cost, so we just tossed the in the trash. Good money down the drain. <end>  Awesome  I have had this Necklace for a long time now. Several years and it is holding up very well so far. <end>  great for the price  i am happy with this cord. hope the ends don't come loose as with some people. maybe they didn't state the bail size earlier so you didn't know what this would fit. i don't know. but they do say what size this will fit now and so i knew exactly what to expect. thanks for that silver insanity. <end>  love it  I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction. <end>  Very nice  great necklace only one issue the clasp was small and hard to put together but once you get adjusted to it not so tough <end>  Broke in 1 Day!  This looked great when it came, but broke in only one day. REALLY poor craftmanship. <end>  If you can't get your pendents on it, how good can it be  I own over 100 pendents. Of them, I found only about 8% had holes large enough to thread this through them. More thought should have been given to practical aspects of this cord. <end>  Impossible to easily put on and take off  This is a nice looking leather cord necklace. Unfortunately, if you are over the age of 3 with adult sized hands and fingers, it is practically impossible to get this cord on and off. The tiny, poorly designed spring-ring clasp is impossible to open and close easily. And trying to undo this clasp from behind your neck is extremely cumbersome. I am having to slip it on and off OVER my head. Clasp needs to be made for ADULTS! Same comments apply to the 7.5 inch leather cord bracelet. Your designs were obviously not tested with real adults. NOT GOOD. <end>  great buy!  I've looked and looked for this length leather cord and couldn't find one. Great price too. <end>  Wrong Size  I purchased this chain to go along with the cross pennant I was buying. I thought it would fit because I read that people who bought the pennant also bought that chain. In reality, the pennant didn't fit on the chain. <end>  Cord Necklace  Cord necklaces look chic with any pendant and with any type outfit. They have been the answer to my problems with sensitive skin. <end>  Great looking leather chain!  I love this leather chain~ it comes in different lengths and in brown, too. It looks great with big silver pendants and my turquoise pendants. They look great layered too~ just be very careful with the catch on it however, I've found it can break pretty easily. A stronger catch would be excellent but if you are careful with it, it's no problem. Great price for the value! <end>  Nicer than I thought  )  This is actually a good quality piece. I'm happy with craftsmanship. I thought It would have a plastic look to it but doesn't. <end>  Liken it  I'm lovin it bah dah bah bah bah it's a nice cord. Clasp is a little weak but hasn't broken yet. <end>  Cheap Junk  When the necklace arrived it appeared to be much smaller in diameter than depicted in the photos. I decided to go ahead and wear it anyway since I already had it. I wore it for about three weeks with a small pendant. One day I was fueling up my car in the rain and happened to notice something laying on the ground in the water and gas. When I took a closer look, I thought "wow, that necklace and pendant look just like mine." Well, it was mine. Seems that one end of the leather (or what appears to be leather) had just slipped out of the one end of the clasp. Seems it was only held in by some cheap glue that gave way.Don't forget the age old adage, "you get what you pay for", it held very true with this necklace...... <end>
 B000BKS70E  Sterling Silver Black Leather 19" Cord Chain Necklace ||	  Nice necklace, low grade clasp  I did not like the spring ring clasp on this piece. It was hard to hook the ring. A larger clasp or different type would have made this an ideal necklace. <end>  Piece of Junk  The clasp on this thing is very cheap and will seperate from the cord within a few months.My wife found me a couple of other necklaces that have lasted 3 times as long and cost a fraction of this item. <end>
 B000BKV18O  Loon Lapel Pin ||	  Beautiful, handcrafted little pin for a great price  I bought this as a gift and was very pleased with my purchase. The pin arrived very quickly from the seller Jim Clift Design, Inc., and was packaged and presented vnicely. The pin itself looks even lovelier in person than it does online (it's beautifully detailed), and for a mere $5.00, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal on a handcrafted pewter item. Highly recommended! <end>
 B000BKY9D8  Chef's Knife Lapel Pin ||	  to compensate for the 1 star  This is to make up for the 1 star rating. It is a pin, not a knife. Just want to be fair. Read the 1 star rating to understand. <end>  Im guilty.. read desciption  Thought I was buying a knife. For $5.00 plus $3.95 .. Total price of $8.95. I will check on returning. <end>
 B000BL0DQ4  Clear GLOW-n-DARK Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  Not for thin people...  I have a really flat belly button, so when I put this belly ring in, it stuck out REALLY far...so far that I had to take it out. It doesn't look right, but I'm sure if you have more skin to hide the bar it will look cute. <end>
 B000BL0DU0  Sherbet Surprise Stripe Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  Dull  This color is very dull and not vary vivid. It's a nice twist but doesn't catch the eye. <end>
 B000BL0DUU  Juicy Fruit Stripe Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  Too large...  I loved the colors and design of this navel ring. However, I found that the actual ring was way too large for my navel piercing. My navel piercing isn't very deep, but it also is not too thin. I feel that I've wasted my money on something I'll never use. <end>  Service is fine, product isn't.  It may just be that my belly button is small, but the piercing stuck out waaaay too far. I would only suggest this if you have a deep innie. <end>
 B000BLLI04  Studio Katia - LUCKY LADY Dangle Belly Ring ||	  belly ring  The price was good but I did not like it once I received it. <end>
 B000BM6EAW  Flexi Belly Ring - Ruby Red Glitter ||	  Red belly ring=bad idea  This belly ring is really ugly. It looks like a growth or a zit or a sore or something. It wasn't worth $1.99. It is not the company's fault, I wanted a red belly ring. But I don't want it any more. <end>
 B000BM6Z9M  10k Yellow Greek Key Bracelet - 7.25 Inch - JewelryWeb ||	  Disappointed  My disappointment was with the width of the bracelet, it seem to be for a small or young child an item with that kind of detail and for the price should have a little more in width so it can be seen.LB <end>
 B000BM94KY  14k Yellow 3 mm Twisted Hoop Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Great Gift  My wife loved these, and wears them all the time. The twist design looks great up close, and they're not heavy. <end>
 B000BMANT0  Flexi Belly Ring - Blue Mist ||	  Okay...  The color is a little darker than it appears in the photo, it is less of a sky blue an more of a dark blue. The light ball however is lighter and more gray than the bottom ball while the bar is another shade of blue. Under a UV light, the color is uniform and the ring is comfortable. <end>
 B000BMCHVC  Sterling Silver Italian Pallini Bead Ball Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 1.5mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Very Thin, Not for a man  Unfortunately, I am not savvy about thickness terminology, so I went by the photo. The photo must be magnified by a trillion. ha. This necklace is paper thin, and looks like it will not last long at all. The other reviewers who said they were getting this for a boyfriend? This is not a "guy" chain at all. The balls are teeny..it nowhere at all resembles those "dog-tag" chain type necklaces if that is what you are looking for. If you are looking for a nice DAINTY chain for a woman, it would be okay. The seller however was nice enough to write me back about a refund (why I gave 2 stars,)but it was Christmas time and I was just too busy, so didn't get it done. <end>  Tiny  Tiny beads ... too tiny for my body size. Kept the product because I should have done more research before I purchased. If you are a small built lady or a teenager order and enjoy! <end>  VERY PRETTY  THE NECKLACE IS LOVELY, BUT I JUST DID NOT THE SIZE OF THE BEAD. THEY WERE TOO SMALL FOR MAY TASTE. HAD NO PROBLEM RETURNING. <end>  very pretty chain  Sorry I didn't get a slightly larger bead on the necklace, but it's so pretty i am keeping it anyway <end>  No complains. As described.  Nice chain. Probe confirms the quality of silver, not suspiciously too light like many silver products these days.. No complains. Arrived on time. <end>  Nice quality at a great price  This chain has a sturdy lobster claw clasp and I've worn it every day for three months and it's holding up very well. I will buy a few more at different lengths because the price is so great. <end>  Lovely chain  This chain is just what I was looking for to use with a larger silver pendant. It's still as bright and shiny as the day I received it. And best of all...no rashes as it is nickel free as promised!I am very satisfied with this purchase! <end>  Nice but slightly different from description  I purchased this chain in part because the description and photo showed a lobster clasp, but it was instead a regular circular clasp. The chain itself is nice quality, but I wish that it were true to the description. <end>  Nickel Free Chain  I was very happy with this product. I use it with a medical alert tag and therefore wear it all the time. The fact that it was nickel free was necessary in this application. Also, the shipping was fast. Had the chain in about 4 days. <end>  Ball chain  Ordered two - never done this before. VERY happy with results. Love the ball chain, nickle free is a plus. This was so easy to do and turned out really well. Thanks. <end>  GOOD PURCHASE.....  Excellent quality... keep in mind that this chain has a sheen, meaning that it is not very reflective,but it is pure 925 silver... If you are looking for a chain that has more of a shine, you may want to go with silver with a different finish and or coating, or just plain stainless steel... I purchased the 18" chain, and am planning to purchase another , and wear both at the same time... has a great look,but not too much bling.... GREAT BUY!!! <end>  A great chain!  I'm so happy with this chain. It's beautiful, and great quality for an amazing price! <end>  Quality Product  This necklace is great, I bought it due to the fact my boyfriend would break out when wearing a standard dog tag chain. It works and feels more comfortable to him. <end>  Surgically precise  Surgically precise and you don' t even need a degree in medicine in order to make use of it. Looks just like in the picutre and it comes equipped with a lobster clasp. If it' s a nickel free, silver necklace you' re searching for then, look no further because this one is a keeper.  ) <end>  Very nice for the price.  I actually purchased this to be used as an ankle bracelet (it goes around my ankle twice). Excellent quality for the price!! <end>  LOVE IT  great product. just as pictured/described. i put a charm (that i already had) on it and wear it almost every day. <end>  Lovely chain  This chain is just what I was looking for to use with a larger silver pendant.

 B000BMCI7U  Sterling Silver Italian Pallini Bead Ball Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 5mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Great Quality!  Great quality sterling silver necklace and great price. Excellent customer service and super fast shipping. Look forward to making future purchases from Sabrina Silver! <end>  Beautiful!  This necklace is well made, has a nice weight, and arrived just as the seller described. I had been searching for some time for one like this, and I'm very pleased. Also the seller sent it out with lightning speed. <end>  Beautiful, High Quality Chain  The quality and size of this chain exceeds my expectations. It is gorgeous!

 B000BMDP9A  Sterling Silver Italian Pallini Bead Ball Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 2.3mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 36 inch ||	  Sterling Silver bead chain 30"  This chain has kept its bright color & is just the right thickness & length. <end>  Pallini Bead Necklace  Turned out to be a good size for the pendant I needed it for. Nice finish, and seems well-constructed. <end>
 B000BMDPF4  Sterling Silver Italian Pallini Bead Ball Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 4mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Not Great Quality  This necklace (which I bought as a gift) started to discolor within the first couple weeks of regular use. The silver started to flake off and show a pinkish material underneath. The whole thing was thrown away within six months. <end>
 B000BMFUX4  Sterling Silver Italian fine Pallini Bead Ball Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 1.2mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Great price and quality  I love this necklace for my hinu charms. It's a simple and delicate looking chain and my long hair doesn't get wrapped around it. It is delicate so you have to be careful. My son pulled on mine really hard and it broke but I was impressed enough with the product to buy another one because I liked it so much and it was affordable enough to do so. <end>  broke too soon  It broke in a matter of months, I guess the price was too good to be true. The silver is pure though, I didn't get any irritation from the metal, even when not taking it off for weeks at a time. <end>  great chain  I love this necklace! It doesn't make my neck breakout and it doesn't catch in the small hairs on the back of my neck. I have bought one other necklace from Sabrina Silver and I will ALWAYS check her stuff first now when shopping for silver. It arrived incredibly fast and was exactly as described. Great seller, great product! <end>  Disappointed  When I received the necklace, I was very pleased with the overall look of this chain, but as I opened the clasp to put it around my neck, the clasp fell away from the rest of the necklace. Due to poor construction/quality, I was never even able to wear the necklace I paid for. I recommend that you purchase items of this type at a store so you can test them and not waste money on shipping. I would give this a negative 1 star if possible. <end>  Really nice chain!  I'm very pleased with this necklace - delicate looking and different with the beaded texture. It really looks gorgeous. <end>  excellent  i love that chain. it was delivered really fast. will do business with you again. thank you <end>  Ball chain  I've never ordered chains this way. Took a chance and was very happy with results - items were much better in reality than on the website (where it was hard to tell what size mm's are). Love the ball chain - doesn't catch on fabrics and holds the lockets beautifully. <end>  perfect  i love the size of this chain. it is perfect for my daughter and there is still room to grow. i like chokers so ordered one for myself too <end>  Bracelet  The bracelet broke multiple times. Guess u get what u pay for. It didn't cost very much money. Have a merry Christmas. <end>  Mom In NY  Clip broke very easily but company was very good about refunding my payment. It may have been just that one that had the issue. I needed it faster than it would ship or I would have asked for a replacement and tried it again. <end>  Very poor quality  I bought this (as a bracelet) for my sister last fall for Christmas. It looked nice when I got it, but after sitting in the drawer for a month or so, I took it out to wrap it and it appeared that the silver had chipped off significantly.  ( So I threw it in the trash and had to buy something else for my sister. <end>  Snapped after a week of wearing it.  this necklace snapped after a week. Didn't even have any charms or anything on it. it broke off right near the clasp. <end>  Broke the second time putting it on...  ...same as the other reviewer in that the chain broke away from the clasp while just trying to put it on! Very poor quality. A total waste of money in my case. <end>  Very pretty, broke quickly  Purchased two for my daughters. First necklace broke after fwo weeks when my daughter put it between her teeth and bit ( of course that makes sense I thought) but the second one broke only days later when I was pulling my smaller daughters shirt of her head, and I was only gently tugging. Very sweet look, but too fragile, especially for kids. However, it is nearly impossible to find a more secure type beaded neck.ace in a 14" length. <end>  i love to purchase charms or pendants from sabrina's...  i love to purchase charms or pendants from sabrina's. i had an unfortunate incident at a nail salon where both of my purchases broke. <end>  Quality as expected; Super fast shipping  I ordered two silver chains. Both were exactly what you'd expect from the images and the shipping was very fast. I live in Los Angeles though, which is where the shipment also came from, but still, I received my items within 48 hours of placing the order. From my experience, this seller seems reliable. <end>  sterling silver bead chain  This item was shipped and received very quickly. The necklace is exactly as I pictured and was very good quality. Overall a great experience. <end>  Beautiful little chain  Beautiful little chain. It was perfect for what I needed it for. Would certainly purchase it again. <end>  Better than expected  I have another sterling ball chain of slightly larger MM, and it tarnished within a month. I bought this one based on another review that said her products don't tarnish, and after 2 months of constant wear, I agree. It is also strong - I pull on it occasionally, and it hasn't broken. I will certainly look here first for my next sterling purchase. <end>

 B000BMTCK6  SHINING IMAGE LARGE PURPLE LEATHER JEWELRY BOX / CASE / STORAGE / ORGANIZER WITH TRAVEL CASE AND LOCK ||	  Fine Jewerly Never Looked So Good!  I got this Purple leather jewerly box first because the color caught my eye and when recieved it turns out EVEN BETTER than is looks! Now I have the perfect place for all my &#34;Good&#34; jewerly! <end>  LOVE LOVE LOVE  i ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS JEWELRY BOX! I had a different one previously which i thought was large and spacious until all of my jewelry got tangled together and ended up being one big mess! this box is gorgeous and has room for everything!! all different size compartments and perfect spaces for each kind of jewelry. it is a little large and looks clunky on my dresser. but if everything is neat and its the only think on the dresser it looks fine. otherwise i love this item and thank my mom for getting it for me for chanuka!  -) <end>  Great Gift!  Purchased as Xmas gift for my 18 year old granddaughter. She loved it and with purple being her favorite color, made it twice as nice. This is a great jewelry box for a teen or woman of any age. Good quality and very well made. <end>  Great jewelry box  Great jewelry box, lots of compartments and room for all kinds of jewelry. If you are going to buy only one jewelry box, then this would be the one. <end>  Jewelry box  My 13-year-old daughter received this as a Christmas gift, and absolutely loves it. She is tickled with the many drawers and compartments to open and place her treasures in. It really is adorable, very solid. I couldn't be more pleased. Quick delivery too! <end>  Great Company to do business with.  With all the weather making deliveries difficult, Shining Image responded immediately and bent over backwards to help us get our order to our Grandchildren. I would do business with these folks anytime. <end>  Nice for the price!  Very pretty, neatly made, easy to use. Good for an elderly person. The smaller &#34;travel box&#34; is just great - good product! <end>  Great Christmas Gift.  I gave this as a gift to my mother for Christmas and she fell head over heels when she opened it! It had all the space she needed to put ALL of her jewelry, and she has A LOT of jewelry. In the end she was happy because her jewelry had a new home and my pocket wasn't empty. I would recommend this product to anyone who has tons of jewelry it's perfect! <end>  Best Christmas gift ever.......  I bought this jewelry box for my granddaugher for Christmas. I know she is only 5 and this is a bit much but this is the jewelry box I would have wanted when I was her age, long, long ago, so I bought it and I am really glad I did. Of course it was the best Christmas gift ever and my daughter was actually speechless of the beauty and the grandeur of the box. Needless to say my granddaughter loved her jewelry box and will do so many years to come. Maybe my daughter can borrow one or two compartments for her things? <end>  feedback  Yes, this is just what I wanted. It meets all of the necessary requirements that I need for this item. Thank you. <end>  FANTASTIC JEWELRY BOX  A great find as not only a jewelry box but a suitcase and perfect for teens andcollege age girls. <end>  Compact and Beautiful  I took a chance and ordered the purple case, and I am happy I did. The color is luxurious and the leather is soft and smooth to the touch. This box holds my fine jewelry and costume jewelry without being crowded. Easy access to all my jewelry in one case. <end>  Great jewelry box  I bought two of these in different colors. They are very nice, and I am so pleased with them. There are lots of compartments for all different types of jewelry. It is well-made, and should last for years. I like that it can be closed up and carried like a case. The delivery was very fast. <end>  AWESOME JEWELRY BOX  My daughter just loves this jewelry box. So much so, that we might order another one for her to use when she returns to colleget in the fall!!! Her grandmother thinks the box is beautiful. The quality and price are on point. Thank you very much. <end>  Purple pleasure  I love this jewelry box. It is just the right size to hold all of my jewelry. I appreciate the prompt delivery service and love my account with Amazon.com. <end>  Christmas Gifts for my Nieces  Both my teenage niece's had alot of jewelery and no where to keep it. I researched alot of jewelery boxes but most of them did not hold alot of jewelery, and they were very expensive. I bought them both this jewelery box and they both love it. <end>  She Loved it  This was a Christmas gift given to my Fiance, I was excited to give it too her, When she opened it she was all Smiles. it was perfect for all her jewlery and the organizational was key for her. Be sides the Engangement ring this was her second favorite gift that Day. <end>  Excellent in every way....  I was skeptical about the quality of the jewelry box because the price was so reasonable... I was very happy to discover it was everything they said and more. Excellent delivery time, excellent packaging, excellent quality, excellent pricing. The purple color is just as pictured. Thanks for a great price and product. <end>  Box for jewels  It's a spacious box with plenty of room for keep sakes. I like the travel box accessory option that came with it. <end>  Wife liked it  I got this for my wife's birthday present. She likes it; the size is good for her dressing, make-up and general foo-foo region. Larger ones I looked at were like small pieces of furniture which would be more difficult for her to integrate into the whole dressing area. <end>  Shining Image Large Leather Jewelry Case  It looks great---well made, and the color (purple) was a good choice.Satisfied with this selection. This is an excellent item. <end>  good storage  I like this box, the picture shows exactly what it is and it has lots of room for all of my jewlery. I like how it closes up and can be neaatly packed away. <end>  very nice quality  this was a very nice jewelry case, very good quality and i love the color! i would recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it. <end>  Needs more glue  i got it today and is ok the back part is falling off but nothing superglue cant fix the box itself is pretty <end>  Jewelry box  We were looking for a large jewelry box for a child. This one is perfect. It seems sturdy and is pretty in purple. My granddaughter loved it. <end>  MUCH smaller than it appears  Ordered this for my daughter as a consolidated jewelry box. However, it is MUCH smaller than I'd anticipated based off the pictures. It might be a reasonable small travel case for multiple peices of jewelry for a long trip, but not if your intent is to keep any signficant collection in one place.It was however, delivered faster than expected. <end>  Big Rip Off  The company that sales this jewelry box never bothered to send it to me. They miss marked the price so they just said oh it must of got lost in the shipping so we will give you back your money. Then I see the same item back on the web site for way more that the orginial price. What ever happened to truth in advertising was lost in this companys file and now no one knows how to use it any more. DONT shop at this company they will rip you off just like thay did me. <end>  Not so Huge  It is not huge! It is so small that my daughter can't fit her toy jewelery in it. It is a toy. <end>  Can't wait to give to my nieces..........  I am so happy with the purchase of this item that I couldn't wait to get the reaction of my nieces ages 5, 8 and 9 (who will all receive one of these for x-mas) before submitting a review. The number of compartments alone should thrill them! The quality of the leather and construction of the case was definitely more than I expected. The tan case is much less yellow than the picture and more of your typical camel color. I also purchased the pink and it's slightly less intense than the picture but also very pretty. Probably would not consider purchasing for myself because it's not the type of case I would want displayed in my bedroom. However, I think for girls ages 5 - 15? it's perfect. Thinking along the lines of being fun for the younger ones and practical for the older ones. Certainly not an heirloom piece to be passed but I think it's a great gift - certainly something I would have loved when I was younger. <end>  LOVE this jewelry box!  This is a HUGE jewelry box! I absolutely love it! Loads of compartments. A place for everything. It even has a mini traveling box that matches the big one and THAT even has its own place in the big one! My favorite parts are the two side doors that house your necklaces on little hanging rods. Very cute! Be warned though, it is really big. If you don't have a lot of space this won't be good for you. It really holds a lot of jewelry. <end>  Great item!  I purchased the tan colored jewelry box. It's pretty big and it fit mostly all my necklaces. There's a space for rings also, but not for bulky rings.It doesn't really have space for earrings. it does have a designated space, but only for small stud earrings. Not hanging earrings of any kind.It still helped me put a lot or things away.If you have a lot of necklaces, then this is a great product!Sturdy. <end>  excellent value gift for a female.  I purchesed the jewelry box for my daughter. I have over the past two years purchased this gift for neices,sister and friends. good quality,nice looking excellent value. <end>  Purple Leather Jewelry Box  This is the best jewelry box I have ever seen. I bought it for my mother in the nursing home. The drawers are just perfect for her butterfly jewelry and she uses the top part for her make up. She can sit the case on her tray table and look into mirror in the lid and apply her make-up. Then she can put her jewelry on. After that she can shut up the case and put the case away, neatly and easily. I recommend this case to anyone. <end>  Mostly good  It's not as elegant looking as the picture suggest but it's not bad. Works good. The lock feature is not that good though and the alignment for the lid is a bit off so you need to get it just right to snap it shut. But it's good for the price and I love the many compartments. My little girl loves it too. <end>  pleased with jewelry case  I received my jewelry box today and I really like it. I immediately moved my stuff into the case, and it fit everything I needed to in it. My bulkier stuff is hanging elsewhere, but that's okay. The little travel case is really cute -I might give it to my daughter! The jewelry box came quickly and in new condition as advertised. All good. <end>  Great gift  Bought this online from very far away--as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, age 10. She loved it on sight!I wanted one for myself, but they are all gone and no word on restocking. Disappointed. <end>  usefull  If you have to give a present, i think this is a good idea, because its practical and every women will love it for that! <end>  Gorgeous case!  Our first order went missing with UPS, but Shining Image sent out another and I'm glad they did! The case has a solid feel, the lining is very plush and high quality. And, it's PURPLE leather! Very high quality item. Lots of storage space, too. I have no idea what people are talking about saying it's small.....it's exactly the size stated in the description, and it looks large and substantial on the bureau. Very pleased! <end>
 B000BO9PJM  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 3 mm Black Color 1/4 cttw Brilliant Cut ||	  so cute!  i got these earrings today and they're even better looking than i thought they'd be! with 3 holes in my ears i'm always looking for filler pieces for my top two holes with a stand out piece in the bottom. these are great! didn't know black could still sparkle like this! <end>  Stud Earrings  I'm not too happy with these earrings. I wore them for about half a day and one of the stones fell out. So I would say the aren't made well. <end>  Great for men  I bought this earring for me (btw I am a man) because I have given up on big flashily bling-bling earrings. I think this one is less of an attention getter but it is still good looking. Be aware that this pair of earring is very small. <end>  Earrings  I bought these earrings for my cartilage piercings, and I love them! They're small, but noticeable and match anything. Very happy with this purchase! <end>  Earrings  These earrings are really cute, but I thought that they'd be bigger in size.. When I got them, I was really disappointed. They are really small..  / But they're still cute.. Not much of an attention grabber. <end>  Eye catching!  My earrings arrived today and I am so excited! They are even prettier in person. The on line photo doesn't do them justice. They are so pretty!! Sturdy quality post and back. I can't wait to wear them. The size is just right for a regular or 2nd hole in the ear. <end>
 B000BOC6IY  15" Sterling Silver Rust, Black and Turquoise Satin Cord Set ||	  satin cords  I bought these satin cords for my daughter who is very happy with my purchase. She said the quality was good and liked that they are adjustable. <end>  Just what I was looking for.  I really wanted only a black satin cord, but this price for three cords was the best deal I found. The satin and little bit of silver appear to be high quality- the silver is very shiny. I would recommend this merchant and I would not hesitate to do business with them again. <end>
 B000BOQWXE  Powell 508-315 Louis Philippe Jewelry Armoire ||	  Beautiful Aimoire  On October 8, 2010 bought this for my wife as a wedding present due to her always complaining about not having enough room in her old jewelry box. First thing you will notice is that this is Real Wood and not some laminate stuff. Because its heavy as hell. Second its wonderfully mad and the color matched just about perfectly with our bedroom set which is also Louis Phillippe. I will say that on the side doors could use a few more hooks but I added that really quick for $5 from Home Depot. The hardest thing was to find a place that we could put it, so that both side doors could open and we could get into them without a problem. <end>  Beautiful piece of furniture  This is a beautiful armoire. Beware - it is heavy - 100 pounds empty and you must get it into your house on your own! I was able to reduce the number of armoires I had because of this piece. Nice wood. I only wish it had drawer stops, so you wouldn't be able to pull out the drawer completely. Well worth the money. <end>  Jewelry Armoire  This is a beautiful, sturdy piece of furniture. It's the perfect addition to our bedroom with plenty of room for more jewelry ) <end>  Great Buy - slight damage in shipping  I ordered the armoire after reading all the reviews for similar products. Most had severe damage during shipping, accept this item. There were some comments about minor issues, but nothing major. Ours arrived with one corner of the box slightly pushed in, but there did not appear to be damage from the outside. My wife opened it on Christmas Day (a present) and was thrilled! There was one small compression in the wood on the top back left corner of the armoire. Fortunately, the lid hides it 95% of the time. You really have to look to see it and know that it is there. So my advice, when it arrives, do as I did, make sure the box is in good tact. If not, it is probably damaged. The Armoire itself is perfect for my wife. I use to think she had lots of jewelry, but no, she has plenty of room left. She can now see her bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, etc. She is wearing jewelery that she has not worn in years because she can find it! And as one reviewer wrote, you can add more hooks to the side compartments for necklaces if you need more space. It is well made and good quality for the money. Just be weary of possible shipping damage. <end>  beautiful and great quality!!  This jewelry armoire is exactly what I was looking for! Very heavy, well made and beautiful! Would recommend this highly! <end>  Beautiful!  The product arrived in pristine condition and my mother adores it! She has wanted an armoire for years and this Valentines she finally got one. It is packaged very well and is built to last. If you are considering an armoire, don't go for anything less than the best. <end>  Excellent purchase  Very pleased with the armoire. Very good quality, practical and beautiful.Price is fair for the quality. Sandra, New York <end>  Beautiful!!  I love it! It is very well made, it a good height and has alot of storage. The only thing I wish is that it would lock. <end>  Great Purchase  I was a little leery about purchasing a piece of furniture online but the end results were great. The armoire arrived well packed and without a scratch. The colour is perfect and it is large enough to hold alot of jewellery. The bottom drawers are deep enough to hold some of the jewellery I like to keep in their original boxes. A good solid item. One small issue was the mirrored lid does not stay up on its own but I don't really use the mirror anyways. <end>  It's made of painted compressed paper  The quality of this product is something many individuals are excepting as ok,It is not in my opinion. Furniture made from compress paper will not stand up with time. <end>  Jewelry Armoire  I bought this for my wife while I was deployed. She was really happy with it. It showed up with a broken left door and no screws to attach the top. I am not satisfied with those issues but she won't send it back. So I guess when I get home my work will be cut out for me to fix this Piece of...furniture. <end>  Finally Organized!  This piece has a very sturdy build and it is heavy! The doors needed a bit of adjustment, but I was not surprised. You just need to loosen the screw either on the top or bottom on the door to adjust and then tighten it back up. It took longer to get it out of the box than to fix that. The drawers are good sized and plenty of dividers for my bangles, hoops. The necklace holders on the sides hold dozens of items. Beautiful finishes on the wood and hardware and it is exaclty the color I thought it would it be. <end>

The necklace is everything & more of the description.

 B000BP8OMU  Sterling Silver Italian Magic Herringbone Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 5.5mm Beveled Edges Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Terrific bracelet!  I really am enjoying this bracelet (which I just received this week) - the 5.5 mm width is great for me - it shows the pattern on the herringbone and the shine of the silver to great advantage. The bracelet fits well and it's very comfortable. I love that Sabrina Silver has bracelets in 7 inch lengths, which are getting rare in silver. I highly recommend it. <end>  very nice necklace  I got this just before Christmas and I absolutely LOVE it....it's just so pretty and I have gotten many compliments on it. <end>  Silver necklace  It's beautiful and just what I wanted. Shipping was fast. So far I have had no problems with it. <end>
 B000BQ1RLO  Pugster Gold Cathedral Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Gift Jewelry Ring Fashion ||	  decent  The mounting style is what caught my eye. It has nice elevation above the finger. The stone has nice sparkle. The silver prongs add to the brightness of the stone. However the color of the gold is too much in the yellow/orange range to look 'real.' I know it's not real, but aren't we going for a good "look a-like?" Overall it is a decent cocktail ring. <end>
 B000BQ4YW8  Pugster Sterling Silver Band Cz Accent Gift Fashion Jewelry Ring ||	  Cute ring!  Ring was just as described! It looks great on the finger and the delivery was super fast! Great A+++ seller! <end>
 B000BQ6XSG  Pugster Size 7 Pink Mother Flower Sterling Silver Ring Pearl Bracelet ||	  Stones Fell Out  I bought this ring for my daughter for Christmas '08 and some of the stones have already fallen out.She was disappointed and needless to say I was too.The ring was very attractive but with the stones falling out not so cute anymore. <end>

 B000BQLCLO  72" Vintage Style Long Green and Pink Faux Pearl and Glass Layered Endless Necklace and Earrings Set ||	  Would give less than 1 star if could...  The necklace was in terrible shape. Not only was it broken when I received it due to the jump rings not being entirely closed, but some of the decoration wasn't even attached to the pearls properly. I'm very disappointed and would have expected a LOT better considering the price. Expect when you receive it to have to do repairs on the item before giving it to someone. <end>

 B000BRLHU4  Sterling Silver Oval Black Onyx Ring ||	  black onyx ring  This ring is fabulous. You cannot appreciate how stunning it is in the picture. The scroll work is awesome.It fits nicely on the finger, doesn't spin around. Very comfortable and looks like a very expensive ring. A really good value, not to mention a gorgeous piece. I would highly recommend this ring to anyone. I have small hands, wear a size 5 ring. It is not overwhelming on my hand. Just perfect! Thank you Eve's Addiction!!! <end>  Not as pictured.  I did not like this ring. The silver was very light weight and instead of what appeared to me to be caviar beading on the gallery as shown in the picture, there was a cut out pattern. The onyx was very dull. Maybe there should be more photos of the ring from different angles so that the potential buyer gets a better idea of the ring's design. That being said, the ring is pretty. It was just not what I was looking for or expected. However, the seller was great. I received the ring quickly and the return was painless. <end>
 B000BSORL4  Dream Story Necklace (length  18") ||	  Beautiful Necklace  We gave this necklace as a Bat Mitzvah present, it was even better in person than the picture. Very pretty and at a very reasonable price. <end>
 B000BT5L36  14K White Gold 1/2 ct. Diamond Pendant with Chain (Higher Quality) ||	  She loves it  This was my second purchase from Katarina Jewelry (my preferred jewelry site doesn't do necklaces). Very good price, incredibly fast service, and my wife loves it. In fact, I think she likes this necklace even better than than the single diamond item (with bigger stone) I got her for our anniversay last year (also from Katarina) that cost just over twice as much as this one. Much nicer than the photo; pretty, delicate, very sparkly (even the chain). Nice item for a nice price.One teeny little thing  it comes in a very pretty box...that is about 3 times as big as it needs to be. Other than that, extremely happy with this purchase! <end>

 B000BU0BY4  Sterling Silver Multicolor Crystal Vintage Like Bracelet 7.25 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Gorgeous!  When I saw this bracelet, I thought..."I like the colors. It's not too expensive. Let me get it." But when I opened the box after receiving it in the mail, I almost fell over. The colors are so much more vibrant in real life. And the sterling is so shiny! The combination makes it difficult to take your eyes of the bracelet! <end>
 B000BU2EL2  Sterling Silver Multicolor Crystal Vintage Kind Bracelet 7.25 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  A Real Showstopper!  This bracelet goes with pretty much every outfit I own. Everywhere I go someone asks me where I got it. I am so impressed with the bracelet's quality and the brilliant sparkle it has. I also purchased this same bracelet in the pastel colors for summer. I love it just as much! <end>  Lovely Swarvorski Bracelet  I have recieved so many compliments about this bracelet...I kept one and gave one as a gift....she was thrilled!...It looks 'vintage'...and is quite charming....and what is more charming is the price! <end>
 B000BUC0X4  6mm wide Green Jade Band Gemstone Ring Size 5.5 to 9.5 ||	  looks cheap  I have purchased the jewelry before and I was very disappointed with the overall quality and appearance. This jewelry looks cheap and the quality is very poor. I would definitely suggest you not get this ring. In fact, I ordered the ring and gave them to my granddaughter. <end>  It's glass and it breaks  The ring is nice, but apparently it is not made of jade rock. It shattered after being accidentally dropped from a sink onto the ground. <end>  Just like the picture  If you like the way it looks in the picture, you'll like it. Nicely made, very pretty, very simple ring. <end>  Genuine Jade  The product met our expectations.the ordering, payment, and shipping processes were trouble free.We ordered given the small ring size of 6 , which is what we needed.And we will order others soon. <end>  GENUINE GREE JAD3 6 MM BAND GEMSTONE RING  PRODUCT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY NICE AND SAFE AND IT IS A VERY NICE RING. I LIKE THE 5 MM RINGS BETTER BUT ITS NICE I JUST HOPE I DON'T DROP IT SO THAT IT BREAKS FOR THAT WILL MAKE ME VERY UNHAPPY. <end>  genuine green jade  it was beautiful when I received . but when I wear first day it broken , that was very dispointed. <end>
 B000BUE8HK  Peridot tie clip, 'Free Soul' 2" W 0.2" L ||	  Pretty but not too functional  The tie clip was beautiful, but, did not work too well as a tie clip due to it not clinging on tight enough to the tie. <end>
 B000BUJVB8  Sterling Silver 3ct White Princess and Bright Royal Blue Baguette Engagement Ring Wedding Band Set Size 7(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Bulky  The stone looks like cheap glass and the ring is really bulky - like steel. I never wear it. <end>  Very Disappointed  I was very disappointed in this ring when it arrived. The center stone looks very fake. The setting itself is beautiful so I have kept the ring set with plans to replace the center stone in the future. <end>  SECRET KEY TO OPEN WOMEN LEGS  WOW am i glad i got this for my girl, if you get this for your girl or just some chick you wanna bang it works, some say its the long lost key to open any pair legs from a lady...dont believe me then see what happens wen you dont give em a ring, then we'll see whos laughing....you jerks <end>  really pretty  This is a really pretty peice, just wish you had it with green stones.... <end>
 B000BULUGM  Mens Sterling Silver Oval Black Onyx Inlay Ring Size 10(Sizes 9,10,13) ||	  Beautiful  This ring looks exactly like it does in the picture. It is nice and sllek and I am very happy with it. The ring may appear to be heavy but surprisingly it isn't that bad. <end>
 B000BULUGW  Atlantis Fantasy Crystal Triscillian Pendant Necklace ||	  Excellent item  This piece is perfect for just a touch of whimsy and not a lot of flash. It looks wonderful with the gold and pewter coloring and different color gems. I wear it on a longer chain (not the one that came with it) and it has a nice weight to it. I would definently recommend this to a person who likes the unusual. <end>
 B000BULUIU  Sterling Silver Celtic Heart Knot Spinner Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  Bulky & Hard to Spin  When I first opened the package and saw the ring I noticed the outside band was pretty thick. I have a spin ring and it's not as nearly as bulky. I think the design is pretty but I was also having a hard time spinning it. It isn't extremely true to size due to the thickness of the outside band but if you want a ring that is bulky and stands out then this is a good ring for you. <end>  ideal ring  I actually returned this ring as it was a little large [must be the difference between UK and US sizing] ..contacted seller and when she received the return, she posted out a smaller size. love the ring and so does my man ..using it as an engagement ring ..thought it was very appropriate with the heart design ;-) x <end>  Email Me Back!/They did eventually  Received the ring promptly but it was the wrong size. Have emailed the company 4 times now to please send instructions to return and send me the correct size. No return emails, becoming very frustrated. It is a nice spin ring, exactly as pictured and I expected, but I NEED MY CORRECT SIZE....please  )Okay they did get back to me but not before I sent the ring back requesting a larger size. After reading the other reviews I ordered a size larger than usual and was happy I did. They sent the larger ring out very promptly and I am a happy customer now. I added another star to my review as well ) <end>  Celtic Ring  Sizing is off. Had to return and re-order 1 1/2 sizes larger than all my other rings. The exchange was quick with no problems. I have no complaint about quality and it is a pretty ring; however, it feels big and clubby on my hand. Plus, my finger sweats underneath the ring. It is just not comfortable to wear. <end>  Love it!!!  I love this ring. It fits just right and I love the design on it. <end>  Very nice ring!!!  This ring is really great for that special someone! My girlfriend spins it all the time! She absolutely loves the ring! I would recommend this ring for any special holiday or for new couples. <end>  awesome!  Bought this ring as a thumb ring everyone notices it and comments about how pretty and cool it looks then when I spin it they want to know where I got it I would recommend this ring to any one also very comfy. <end>  Sizing runs small  I loved this ring. Good quality for the price. I found the sizing was small, I would recommend purchase one size up. <end>  Not Happy  After recieving ring in a size that was what I ordered, but, not the true size according to jewelers measurement I returned the ring for a larger size. After recieving instuctions on how to return ring I did exactly as told. When after 2 weeks and no ring or explanation from company I contacted them and was told they had not recieved the ring but, would refund my money. The total credit I recieved was for the amount of ring and original S&H; but not the shipping I paid to send it back or the money I had to send to get the ring shipped back to me again.The emails exchange with Silver Insanity was very unprofessional, making me wonder if this company was ready to go internet with such a large market through Amazon.Will NOT order from them again. <end>  not impressed  i thought that this ring looked pretty in the photo, but when i recieved it i was not impressed how it looked on my hand. it looks like a ring that will tarnish very easily <end>  A priceless ring from the best jewelry store!  I havent written a review on this ring, deciding that I was too busy. But, after reading some of the reviews, I HAVE to put my two cents worth in!First, I think this is a great ring for the price! I actually thought it was more beautiful in person than it was in the photo. GREAT BARGAIN I have seen similar rings, sterling silver, in other online stores for quite a bit more money. My husband and I exchanged these rings, because we LOVE the intertwined hearts! We believe it represents our commintment to each other. Whenever my husband or I go somewhere new, we never fail to get compliments.Second, this seller, Silver Insanity, is one of the best sellers I have ever dealt with online! I needed to make an exchange, it occurred promptly. I even made a return, and received a gift certificate for equal merchandise, again promptly. The sales staff have always been friendly and helpful! I cannot say enough good things about this seller.Unfortunately, those of us who are happy and have a good shopping experience FAIL to leave feedback, because we decide our lives are too busy or important to take the time. So, it is usually only those that have a problem that speak up. I like to think that everyone has a bad day now and again, and one difficult experience should not leave a person forever with a bad taste in their mouth. I almost always give a seller a second chance...then if things are still not right, only then will I decide not to do business with them again.Bottom line  Great VALUE, beautiful product, and EXCELLENT customer service from Silver Insanity!PS  I came back to get a new ring, because I managed to lose the other... <end>  good item  this is a cute little ring that is perfect for friendship, small anniversarys, little promises and the newly started young couple! the ring is all sterling silver and it makes a great gift. though i was not completely taken aback so i dont reccommend it for really big occasions. but worth the price you pay for! <end>  First spinner ring  This is a very pretty, very unique ring. I had never owned a spinner before and once I realized they existed, I had to have one. The inner ring spins freely without any trouble. It is a bit thicker than a normal ring (for those of you who've never had a spinner). Perfect as a thumb ring. If you should happen to drop it (as I did) and the ring no longer spins freely (gets stuck on a certain spot)...keep manually spinning it, it does become loose again. All in all, a wonderful addition to my collection. OH! Also...it does NOT turn the finger GREEN! Yay. <end>  So pretty!  I didn't realize what "spinner ring" meant. When I got it, I was like 'OH COOL!' The part with the hearts spins inside the outter edges. It's really pretty, and a conversation piece. I really love it. I bought it to fit my first finger, so I spin it with my thumb.  ) <end>  Lightening Fast Shipping  This is the second time I have purchased from this company and I'm very pleased with the results - have recommended to my friends and will definitely be back for more <end>  strong silver  another ring i wear all the time with no dents or bends! i wear it as a pinky ring and it looks great <end>  good quality - good price  Love this ring - it was better quality than I expected for such a low price. Initially we had thought they had forgotten to pack the ring in the shipment. The customer service folks were very prompt in solving the problem and I received the ring two days later. (We did find the first ring and sent it back) <end>  very nice  Beautiful patterns and well made. It is nicely finished and I feel a good value for the price. Shipped very quickly. I can't wait to wear it work Monday! <end>  great ring  I really love this ring, I wear it all the time. I've gotten lots of compliments on it. <end>  AMAZED  My soon to be wife and I have selected non-exact matching rings to be used as our wedding bands. I selected a Celtic braided ring and she selected several rings then told me to choose, lol. And I picked the right one she says, lol. This ring and the one I selected complement each other very nicely. Neither of us has ever had much less heard of a spinner ring before so we were a bit apprehensive but I pulled the trigger on it any way and boy am I glad I did! The picture does not do this ring justice! It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and substantial for the price. We ordered her exact ring size and the ring is very comfortable on her and is not bulky at all. Only time will tell if the spinner was a good choice or not but in any case we are very happy with the purchase. <end>
 B000BUMTM6  Sterling Silver Majestic Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Great Earrings!  These are some of my favorite earrings They are a bit more modern since the cubes are on their side. The colors are a nice blend, and I love the leverback. <end>
 B000BUMWKU  14k Rose Gold 18 Inch X .8 mm Box Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  Pretty Rose Gold 14K Chain  Needed a chain for a diamond journey pendant I had - and I wanted it in 2 days. I got exactly what I wanted - lovely rose gold color that matches perfectly and received it in 2 days in time for my night out. Great price, great-looking chain, great shipping, great seller! <end>  sdsrn  Exactly what I was looking for. Just the right length and does not catch on sweaters. Smooth finish and reasonable price. <end>
 B000BUMZZC  Sterling Silver 4mm Purple Tube Jade Gemstone 7.5 inch Bracelet With Secure Latch Clasp ||	  broke and uncomfortable to wear  I bought this thinking it would be great. Unfortunately the clasps has sharp spikey bits on it that dig into your skin and hurt. It also broke.Don't buy it <end>
 B000BUO258  Sterling Silver Diagonal Clear Crystal Bracelet 7 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  stunning!!  The crystals are beautiful. I purchased it about two months ago but haven't worn it yet, because it does not fit my wrist. I wish there was an easier way to shorten it. <end>
 B000BUPVJ4  14k Rose Gold Round 20 Inch X 1.4 mm Wheat Chain Necklace - O Ring Clasp - JewelryWeb ||	  Rose Gold 20 inch necklace  It is lightweight, and beautiful, but the wheat link chains are strong. I needed something a bit longer than what was supplied with a necklace my husband had purchased and this fit the bill nicely. <end>
 B000BUQPRQ  Sterling Silver Dragonfly Pendant with Pearl Chain ||	  Tiny, cheaply made...  This item is much, much smaller than you will think... necklace is 16 inches, barely large enough for a child... dragonfly is as big as your thumbnail... chain came apart in my hand as I was handling it... returned to vender... <end>  Oh, so happy with purchase!  The purchase of the dragonfly necklace was so easy. I was very pleased with the quick delivery of the necklace, and the quality of craftsmanship. Would use seller again. <end>  Dragonfly necklace  I bought this necklace as a gift for my aunt. It is perfect for an older woman, the pearls really give it a nice look while the dragonfly is fun. It is made very well and my aunt loved it! <end>
 B000BUUPE0  White CROSS Logo Eyebrow Ring ||	  Just your typical piercing jewelry  There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points - Does not discolor skin- Ends stay screwed on relatively well- Not very prone to damage / cracking <end>
 B000BUV1MU  Fleur de Lis Interchangeable Enamel Rings ||	  NOT real enamel!  This is listed as "enamel". Well, it isn't. It's some sort of plastic coating on the inner ring. Real enamel is glass, and it's quite durable. I washed my hands with this ring on - just regular soap - and it took the gloss off the ring. Pathetic! I should have known better than to pay this much! I won't be fooled again...I hope. <end>  fun  As far as costume jewlery goes, this is a fun piece. I always take my rings off when washing hands or putting lotions on to avoid destroying any metals (see previous review). I like the interchangeable bands. Fits true to size. <end>
 B000BUY5XM  Sterling Silver Peridot and Pink CZ Ring ||	  Nice but not great!  Thought that the peridot would be darker or brighter and was surprised at the band that looked like an eternity ring. The large stone looks more yellow than green. But as time goes on, I find that it looks great with all my yellow tops. <end>  Soooooo Cute  I ordered this for my niece for graduation, but it came so quickly that I couldn't help but give it to her early. Pictures were very true to form, and she absolutely loved the ring. Very sparkly, very cute on her hand. Given a do-over, I would definitely purchase it again. Love Eve's Addiction's style. <end>  Addicted to Eve  I love this ring. I find that when I wear yellow or green the peridot stands out, and when I wear red or pinks, the pink stones stand out. Nicely made, true to size, quick delivery. Perfect way to add sparkle to your life without spending a bundle and then being afraid to wear and enjoy on a daily basis. <end>  Looked better in the picture but still cute  The pink stones by the sides aren't as vivid as in the picture. They were ligter in color than I expected. <end>
 B000BV00Z8  Sterling Silver Diamond Cubic Zirconia Engagement Ring ||	  looks better in the picture  looks grander in the picture. looks like gawdy cut glass, no color, costume jewelry <end>  love the sparkle  This ring sparkles and looks great. I can't afford the real thing, so this really works well for me! <end>
 B000BVAPVW  Carnelian necklace, 'Twin Moon' 0.6" W 35" L ||	  Good stuff  I get complements every time I wear this necklace. It is light and can be worn many ways. The carnelians were well matched. One of the knots came undone and I briefly lost a bead but was able to reattach. <end>
 B000BVKWQK  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Irish Wedding Band Spin Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  Nice ring.  I gave this to my fiance as a sort of engagement band. He loves it, the only problem is, the center band spins and kind of betrays the purpose of the Claddagh (positioning vs. marital status). Plus, if your man is a rough and tumble kind of guy, this might not be the ring you want. The band started to come apart after a while and dirt and gunk gets built up in it so it doesn't spin right. If you are purchasing it as a gift for a not so rough guy, it would be great, or if it was just meant to be worn every now and then. Don't count on it to be your engagement ring though, it's not so good for that. <end>  Nice, can't be beat for the price  It has three of the little symbols on it. My understanding was that the symbol (the hands with the heart) when faced one direction meant the person was taken and when faced the other direction the person was not. Well two of the symbols face one direction and the third faces the other. <end>  Perfect  I was looking for a different type of ring and found thisIt is perfect, just as I hoped and my boyfriend loved it.It was a great gift for him and for no special reason. <end>  love the design but sizes run small  If this ring was a little larger I would probably wear it more often. Its almost as if the size is the outer most ring. I love the design. I've actually thought about buying more as gifts for friends, but remembering to order larger sizes. <end>  Cute but...  I bought this ring as a Valentine's gift but couldn't give it since the hands holding the heart symbol would reverse whenever the ring spins (there are 4 of them on this ring, alternating the facing direction). It's a cute ring so I just kept it for myself. <end>  Nice Ring!...  I had originally bought this ring for my daughter, who has wanted a Sterling Claddagh ring for a while now,and she does enjoy the 'spin' effect, but it turned out to be too big for her, so my husband took it instead.He has only worn it a few times, but he does like it and so I am happy I got it ~ I do plan to get one for my daughter still, maybe a size smaller this time??  ) <end>  Ring is Nice...Customer Service Stinks!!!  I purchased the ring as a surprise gift not knowing the proper ring size at the time. According to the website you can exchange the ring for a different size within 60 days so I figured I would just go ahead and purchase and then exchange after the surprise was given. They ask that you email them first before you send the ring back to ensure they set aside the correct size for shipment. I have sent three emails now asking for authorization to return the ring with no response. We like the ring but it would be nice if they would be concerned with customer satisfaction! We won't be doing anymore business with this seller. <end>

 B000BVQBOM  Pugster Dark Gray Feather Swarovski Crystal Diamond Accent Animal Brooches Pins ||	  Yes!  I ordered this pin as a birthday gift for my boyfriend's mother - a huge risk, I know. I was THRILLED when I received the package. I cannot believe a pin of this quality is priced this low! It is beautiful! The pin has much detail and a shimmering stone body. I almost want to keep it for myself but I will give it to "mom" because I think this really will win her over (this is our first meeting!) The pin came in a lovely box  lined in white tucked satin. The box itself is textured like linen and very thick so this gift looks very lavish. If you like pins or like fish, buy THIS! <end>

 B000BVXX20  6G 5/8" 316L Steel Barbwire Captive Ring ||	  Pictures Lie  Even though the picture shows two earrings you only get one earring when you order so you have to order twice to get a complete pair. Also the barbed wire closure had to be pried off to put the earring on and now noone can put it back on. <end>

The is even some shelves to I put my perfume in! Very spacious and beautiful to look at! It is very sturdy and was packed very well for shipping.The only complaint is that when putting it together, the very first brackets, the holes were drilled wrong to screw in the brakets for the lower shelf. I had to do it myself. <end>

 B000BX1LB8  Mele Walnut Essence Jewelry Box With Curved Front ||	  Very Nice Jewelry Box  I bought this jewelry box as a gift for my gf and we both like it a lot. It looks as good if not better than the picture displayed on Amazon.It seems to be well made without any flaws - the wood is nice; the interior is nice; and the overall design is nice. It's very nice and functional. You could put a lot of jewelry in this beautiful walnut jewelry box.The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is b/c I encountered two problems with my order.1.) The jewelry box wasn't packed with styro-foam, air pillows, crumpled newspaper, etc. in neither the original packaging nor the shipping packaging. As a result, the bottom left corner of the jewelry box was slightly crushed. The impact was severe enough to splinter and chip some wood. Also the wooden drawers were slightly chipped by the drawer handles. Ideally, the jewelry box should have been secured in styro-foam in the original box like laptop and desktop computers. (The shipping was free.)2.) There was a 2" x 5" tape on the interior mirror. This left a 2" x 5" sticky adhesive stain on the mirror. I was able to remove it using a small amount of nail polish remover. (I wouldn't recommend using WD-40 b/c it is toxic and it really is a lubricant for machine parts.)I decided to keep the jewelry box b/c it is very nice and the minor damages aren't too noticeable unless you inspect it closely.Hopefully in the future it will be packaged better. <end>

My friends are like you must of pay alot for that ...a secret i keep to myself (smile)Sterling Silver Mother of Pearl Inlay Celtic Knot Ring (Size 5,6,7,8,9,10) <end>  tiny ring  The real ring looks very small like little kids rings! The quality of silver is poor. <end>  ring  This ring is beautiful and it is one of my favorites. I own tons of rings, but this one I wear every day. One con though, is that it scratches very easily. <end>  Very Pleased  I was hesitant ordering a ring online, but I am very please with this product. Its a nice size and the silver is very smooth so it doesn't cut into your skin at all. Also, Shipped very fast. I ordered it on Tuesday and it was delivered Thursday morning. Overall very happy and will probably order from them again.   ) <end>  Very Pretty  I got this ring very quickly and I really love it! It's just the right size for me, and the right scale--I don't wear large pieces so this is nice! <end>  Junk  What a piece of junk, it's going back today. There is no way the sizing is correct. <end>
 B000BX8B1G  Sterling Silver 4-Band Weaved Puzzle Knot Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  The puzzle ring I have been waiting for!  I have been looking at puzzle rings for a long time, waiting to find the perfect one for me. Admittedly I purchased this one primarily because I got a gift certificate to Amazon.com from a Coinstar. It arrived quickly, but was too small. I exchanged it for a larger size with minimal wait. Now I can wear my ring! It doesn't look exactly like the picture. Instead of the outer knot being heartshaped, it is more straight on the outer edges. The ring still looks good. I cleaned mine with jewelery cleaner and it shines brilliantly. Overall I am 100% satisfied and would recommend this seller to anyone looking for a good deal on a unique product. <end>  A little disappointed  I was a little disappointed when I received my ring in the mail. In the picture provided above the sides look like they make a heart shape, or at least it looks like smooth, clean curved lines. The ring I got in the mail looks like the sides are smushed in and not clean curves. Other then that I like it. I just wished it looked like the picture. <end>  Too Much Trouble!!  I never bought a puzzle ring before, and I never will again. It was a pain to figure out and the website does NOT have a solution. The ring was already tarnished, especially in the spots where the rings overlap. If you take off the string (which you eventually will), the rings easily come apart when you take it off your finger (or when you need to polish the rings), which is very inconvenient b/c then you have to "reassemble" it again.I wasn't expecting this much trouble, and it would've helped if it came with instructions. I plan on returning this ring. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is one of my fave rings. It comes with a string around it so it won't fall a part when you take it out of the box. Although, mine has to be "taken" apart. It doesn't just fall apart like some of the looser knots do.I love this ring & the company has a video you can watch & learn to how to put it, & other puzzle rings, back together. The indviual bands are thin & can bend so you have to be nice it, but it is well worth the money. <end>  Bad buy  I was very unhappy when I got my ring. It was extreamly tarnished and left black dust all over my hands. The picture makes it look shinny and clean and it is anything but. The metal it is made from is extreamly frail and is easily bent out of shape. Also, once apart, the ring never sits right again even though I have put it back together correctly. <end>  nothing like the picture  Well after the long wait i was excited to finally have my ring . And when I open the box I was more than a little disappointed with what i received. The picture makes the ring look like it isn't smushed pieces. I am very disappointed with my ring. <end>  Beautiful ring!  I absolutely love this ring and unfortunately I took off the little string that was holding it together. I took it and absent-mindedly set it down with my other jewelry,when i picked it up it feel apart. I have been trying to put it back together to no avail. Can someone please post the solution? I emailed the company, but have yet to hear back from them..thanks  ) <end>  Fixing is not impossible!  This ring surpassed my expectations especially at how easy to fix it was contrary to all the hype about it being impossible! Someone I knew was really good at puzzle rings and when mine came apart he showed me once how to do it and I still remember! This ring looks amazing and is such great quality.  -D <end>  Good product for price!  This was a great puzzle ring for the price. Obviously it's not $300 quality ring but it's amazing for the low price! It took a while to figure out but that's what makes it fun. If you can't figure it out there are many sites online. <end>  seriusly.  this ring is not sterling silver. its made out of this black type of rock? I don't even know, it's for my girlfriend so its a smaller size, not like other puzzle rings where they're bands of silver these are like each individual rings connected like a puzzle ring. I've searched the site that the receipt is marked for; silver insanity to no prevail of finding the ring on the site to look what they price it as. Out of all the things I have bought for the holidays this year this is what i was really looking forward to to have some mineral covered in silver makes this a straight lie to sell as "sterling silver" if planning on buying this for someone i say don't do it. I look at reviews and decided to buy this for all the positive reviews this ring has received but it sucks. This ring is honestly a piece of junk compared to some puzzle rings I've seen and I don't now the prices so i can't say it may good for the price but i would have rather spent the extra money. <end>  puzzled me1  It came in on time,It's a nice ring.The only thing is they didn't send instructions how to put it back together.It would have ben nice. <end>  Beautiful craftsmanship.  I know the solution to 4 band rings so I've taken to collecting different looks. This one is very pretty. My finger is an 8 and 9 was the only available size at the time I ordered. The bigger the ring the more spread out the detailed looping it becomes. Still a very attractive ring, and I love it. <end>  really like this ring  This puzzle ring is alot of fun. The metal quality if surprising good. I am very sensitive to mercury or nickel in cheap metals. I have no problem wearing this ring for days at a time. <end>
 B000BXH9PU  Strawberry Pin ||	  Pretty cute, but needs the revise description  I thought this brooch was so adorable! I bought it with my Christmas money when I didn't get it for Christmas . . . but the description read, "White metal" and it's actually yellow. I not a big fan of yellow gold. I mean, at least not on me. It's still really cute though, so I'm going to give it to my sister for her birthday! She wears nothing but yellow gold!  ) <end>
 B000BXKEUM  Freshwater Pearl Necklace 24&quot; ||	  Freshwater pearl necklace  I bought this necklace to replace one I lost some time ago. It's so beautiful. Well made. Nice weight. The one I lost was purchased at a jewelery store and it's hard to tell the difference between the two. <end>
 B000BY2A0I  Boma Square Black Onyx Post Earrings ||	  Nice earrings, but didn't like backings.  These are nice earrings in their design and size, but the backs were difficult to remove. <end>  Great earings and price!  Can't beat the quality and price for these onyx and silver post earings. Is actually even nicer than what looks on line. Very pleased with purchase <end>
 B000BY80P2  Sterling Silver Italian Threader Earrings with Blue Venetian Glass drop total length 4 1/2" Long ||	  Great, but...  They keep coming out of my ears! I guess it would work bettter if I had more than 1 ear piercing per ear. <end>  Design very different from photo.  OK earrings, but the design on the glass beads on the pair I received was very different from the photo. I wouldn't have minded if they had stated in their description that the designs varied, but they didn't. The pair I received was much less blue than the photo and had a few tiny, different-colored flowers. <end>
 B000BY80PM  Sterling Silver Italian Threader Earrings with Leaf drop total length 4 1/2" Long ||	  Beautiful  I purchased these earrings on a whim. I was incredibly suprised with the detail. They are truly a great buy, and have a very elegant look to them when worn. <end>  THE CHAIN IS THICK,.  THE BOX STYLE CHAIN ON THESE IS THICK AND I HAD TROUBLE GETTING ONE OF THEM INTO MY EAR. I HAVE TO SAY THAT ONCE I GOT THEM ON THEY DID NOT SLIP LIKE LIGHTER CHAINS DO BUT IT HURT AGAIN WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE SAME EAR. FOR ME I WOULD LIKE THEM A LITTLE SHORTER BUT THAT IS JUST AN OPENION. THEY ARE NICE AND I AM KEEPING THEM BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL WEAR THEM VERY OFTEN DUE TO THE CHAIN. <end>
 B000BY9EAM  Sterling Silver Gold Mother of Pearl Valentines Day Gift Heart Necklace ||	  Not worth it  It's ok if what you are looking for is a very tiny heart, I'll probably give it to my 8 year old niece. <end>
 B000BYDKUC  Sterling Silver 4 mm Brilliant Cut Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings Basket Set 1/2 cttw ||	  Beautiful!  These earrings are gorgeous... it was exactly what I'm looking for. The size, the brilliance, and especially the workmanship. My birthstone is diamond so I have some "real" ones and these earrings go great in my collection. I highly reccomend these earrings if you want a classy look!!! <end>  Sparkly, but note-- not colored  I agree with the previous review. These are a nice size, the setting is pretty, and they are very sparkly. However, the picture made the gems look like a light blue color to me, and they turned out to be clear (i.e., diamond-like). As long as you're okay with that, I would recommend them. <end>  Very pleased; nice little sparklers  This is a very nice pair of earrings;I really liked the basket setting. The cz's are just the right size, not too big and not too small. They give a very clean, simple, pretty and sparkly appearance. Wonderful price, too! <end>
 B000BYF2DU  Sterling Silver 5 mm Brilliant Cut Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings Basket Set 1 cttw ||	  they are amazing!!!!  -)  i just got them today, i didnt know what to expect since there was no reveiw on this page when i bought them,i just took a chance. when i opened the box i was so happy because i had found exactly what i've been looking for... -) now i'm planning on ordering a pair for my sister cause she loved mine. they look so real, neat and perfect, not too small and not too big. i would recommend these to friends, i'm sure you wont be mad at all, its a great deal i've seen the same go for $19.99 at the mall. i'm enjoying mine so far..... <end>  Great quality for the price!  I took a chance buying these earrings as a small gift for myself since there were no reviews yet. I was a little worried because reviews of similar 4-prong earrings from Sabrina Silver had problems with the stem breaking, so I thought I would give these more substantial settings a try, especially considering the price and 30 day guarantee. I'm glad I did! I have worn them a couple days, and even slept in them after forgetting to take them off... no problems so far!When I opened the box, I was immediately impressed with the appearance. The sterling basket setting is very nice looking, an upscale look if you are looking for diamond look-a-likes. Keep in mind, the basket setting sits higher than a typical prong style, so keep that in mind when ordering. The stones are not too large and sparkle nicely - note the 5mm diameter measurement under product description. Get out your ruler and look at the little marks between centimeter marks - count off 5 and you'll have an idea of how large this stone is in each earring. I actually took a few pairs of studs that I have and like the size of and compared before ordering.All in all, a great purchase at a great price! Thanks Sabrina Silver! I'll be trying more of your styles soon!!! <end>  My family really like these.  The stud is a good weight and length.The stone is a half carrot in each ear.They are perfect for us. <end>
 B000BYGVFS  Sterling Silver 11 mm Brilliant Cut Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings Basket Set 10 cttw ||	  Could have been great.  For the cost I found the CZ amazingly brilliant! HOWEVER, the posts on both earrings were received bent at 45 degrees. I gently straightened them but the post is weakened and may break in the future. <end>
 B000BZ4G6S  8-8.5mm White Cultured Freshwater Pearl Studs In Sterling Silver ||	  Nice quality for the price  Ross Simmons carries a much pricier line of jewelry than these little pearl earrings but they could pass for the more expensive ones! Comes in a nice little box inside a velvet bag. Very tasteful, great quality! Good company! <end>
 B000BZ7016  Libra Charm ||	  going beyond  I must say, out of all the charms I've bought, yours came the best wrapped in tissue[nice] and the box with the silver bow band[better then super fine stores] just excellent and fast ship- and the charms cute and just like the pictures.-thanks & don't stop your excellent service with much pride <end>

 B000C0CXZI  Sterling Silver Sound Wave Spin Band Ring Size 9.5 ||	  Nice ring, terrible service  Ring arrived as promised, but did not fit. Seller did not reply to repeated requests for return. Make sure you get what you want, because you won't be able to return it! <end>
 B000C0OH70  Tricolor Taurus Zodiac Charm Pendant ||	  Great service at jewelrydays.com  This is where the company really shined.I had some questions regarding the item, the answers where quick.Unfortunatly they m isunderstood me so I got some wrong answers.When i got the pendant, i was a little upset since the pendant wasnt like i thought it would be.fortunatly i got great service when i contacted the company and ended up keeping the jewelry since it is a beutifull pendant.Just to people who wonders the pendant is only a shell <end>
 B000C0Z9X6  Sterling Silver Cube Shaped Clear AB Crystal Multi Faceted 1 inch Long Pendant Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  very pretty  I just recieved this pendant and I really like it. I'm not sure that the crystal is genuine Swarovski but it's still nice. Gotten several compliments on it. It's not too big and not too small. Very nice. <end>  very supprise  i recieved this pendant today and the earrings to match. i was very supprised, at how pretty they are, especially the pendant. very sparkely and so many colors. this is a keeper. i got complements already.get your today ladies <end>  Nice Pendant  This isn't the only pendant i've ordered from gem avenue. I purchased this one as a present and am not displeased with it one bit! Lovely clear crystal, speedy shipping! <end>  Great price for a product with such sparkle.  This pendant looks so clear and sparkly. I'm not convinced that it is genuine swarovski crystals because one side of each crystal does have a very faint coat of gold paint (you have to look very hard to see this), however I also saw that on some of the jewelry at the actual swarovski store, so that may be how they should be in order to make them sparkle as beautifully as they do. I gave these away as a gift and all the recipients were very happy. For the price this is definitely an item worth getting. <end>  Swarovski Cube Crystal Pendant  I get many complements every time I wear the pendant. The craftmanship is great and the colors the cube reflects are wonderful. I was so very pleased with the price and even more pleased with the item when I received it. Thank you for offering this item. Brenda <end>  Stunning Pendant  A real eye catcher. Light reflects off the many facets causing a dazzling display. I real love this pendant! <end>  Very Pretty  Is very nice looking. Needs a small chain to fit on.Didn't give 5 stars because I thought it would sparkle more. <end>  too big!  I ordered this pendant to go with a similar cube earrings I bouth from the same seller. I was very surprised when I saw the size of it - it's huge! This means it's not elegant at all and goes mainly with casual outfits. I was hoping it would be more discreet. <end>  Great Pendant  I got this pendant along with the earrings. It has great sparkle and takes on the color of whatever you are wearing. I do recommend buying the matching earrings because it is a great pair. <end>  nice pendant - wish it came with the chain  I love the pendant. It was a little bigger than I expected - looks a bit smaller in the pictures. I get compliments every time I wear it - with jeans and a shirt or with something dressy. The only drawback is that it doesn't come with a chain. (I was able to easily find a nice chain on Amazon, so no biggie.) <end>  This is beautiful  I just love this pendant and have had a lot of compliments on it. The crystal is absolutely beautiful and catches the light wonderfully. <end>
 B000C16THA  CZ Wedding Rings - Sterling Silver Triple Baguette and Round CZ Wedding Sets - Size 5 ||	  Exactly as pictured  Very pretty! It's shiny and sparkly and exactly what I expected. My plan is to wear this set instead of my real wedding rings while traveling overseas. I've been wearing them all week and the quality seems great. <end>  Very Beautiful Rings  These rings are pretty nice on a ladys finger. Silver but for the price its a steal... <end>  very pleased  I bought this to wear while travelling in place of my wedding set. I felt much better and I thought the set was very believable, not too big. <end>
 B000C1EN5K  Amazon.com  Paua (Abalone) Shell and Sterling Silver Square Cufflinks  Clothing ||	  Abalone Cufflinks  The cufflinks are beautiful.

 B000C1TNMS  Handcrafted Diamond-Link and Pink Rose Quartz Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Very pleased!  I am very pleased with this purchase! Sometimes purchasing jewelry without feeling it or seeing it up close is difficult. I thought I'd give it a try with these and do not regret my decision! This earring is very nice. It came in the exact size as described and is beautiful. I am really pleased with this purchase. Very nice earrings at a great price! <end>  3" Long Double Strand Sterling Silver Chain with Rose Pink Crystal Drop Hook Earrings  I fell in love with these earrings as soon as I saw them and I knew I had to add them to my collection.

 B000C4BTU4  30" Sterling Silver Oxidized Rope Chain ||	  Attractive and Unobtrusive  I don't usually wear jewellery. Not even a watch. But I decided to buy myself a small Christmas present and this chain caught my eye. It looks great and is light enough not to be noticable. A great selection at a great value. <end>
 B000C4O4XS  Beautiful Sterling Silver and Onyx Pear Drop Earrings ||	  nice earrings  My girlfriend really liked them. When I inspected them closely, the Onyx on one seemed to be slightly scuffed, but this is not noticeable unless looking very closely. <end>
 B000C5DS70  Sterling Silver Anklet w/ Clustered Double Chime Balls ||	  Very nice anklet  I bought this as a surprise for my wife. I'm a lucky man that my wife actually isn't a big jewelry fan. The anklet is beautiful and she loves it. When I gave it to her I told her that with every step she takes my love for her is always with her, reminding her with the gentle tinkling of the bells. (cheesy I know) It's been over a month and I still catch her shaking her foot and listening to the bells. <end>
 B000C5FRFG  Sterling Silver Charm Anklet w/ Teeny Polished Hearts ||	  Sterling silver heart anklet  Anklet was very pretty and shined in the sun, quality is very impressive and with stood the pounding of the waves. All-in-all, I recommend this product to anyone, the price is right and the product is gorgeous! <end>
 B000C5FS2I  Sterling Silver Anklet w/ Teeny Puffed Hearts ||	  Breaks easily  The heart to chainlink solder has already broken once. Because the chain has extra rings for allowing different sizing, I was able to manage a repair myself. However, I don't expect this ankle chain to last very long given the quality of the materials. <end>
 B000C5J4C8  Sterling Silver Charm Bracelet w/ Drama Masks (Comedy Tragedy) ||	  Very Pleased!  I received the bracelet in just a couple of days and it was exactly what I wanted for my granddaughter as a gift for her end of year drama play!! <end>  silver comedy tragedy charm bracelet  Service was fast, jewelry is nice. Would order again! <end>  Sigh. . . .  Well, it seemed like a good idea and I wanted to love it. . . . I purchased this bracelet for one of my son's friends, who just turned 16 and loves the theater--and I'm decidedly disappointed. The drama masks are so small one can barely see them and the sterling silver feels featherweight. I could see paying $20 or even $25 for this, but, personally, I don't think it's worth $40+. I wish I had time to look for something else. The image shown gave me the impression that, while not of significant size, the masks would at least be identifiable from a short distance. And they're really not. Maybe it's me? Both of the prior reviewers gave it five stars and said they thought it was wonderful. But I have to say, for me. . . not so much. <end>  Unique Bracelet.  Nice bracelet depicting comedy and tragedy. My granddaughter loved it since she is involved with the arts <end>
 B000C5LMXC  Sterling Silver Turtles Charm Bracelet ||	  Don't be deceived by the picture  I was very disappointed with this purchase! It looks nothing like the picture! It looks very cheap the price should be $5.00 <end>
 B000C5LN4U  Sterling Silver Peace Sign Charm Bracelet ||	  Not what I expected  It arrived quickly which was nice, but again, it's small and not what I expected. certainly NOT worth 20 dollars. <end>  Cute  Durable, jangly, and I think the peace sign charms are the perfect size. It's really pretty! <end>
 B000C64DMS  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 7 x 6mm Square Shaped Champagne Cubic Zirconia Rhodium Plated Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Gorgeous ring BAD design  This is my second ring from Gem Avenue. Both had stones that sparkled BEAUTIFULLY, loved them! However, one of the four prongs that hold the main stone in broke off the 2nd time I wore it. Just caught on my shirt and snapped off. Ring is unusable now, but not enough time to get it back within 30 days according to return policy. Paid $20 to wear a pretty ring twice. I DO NOT recommend getting a design in sterling silver where the stone is secured by prongs. The silver is too soft, I guess. Retailer provided a beautiful looking ring, but design is bad. Second ring has stones rattling around in the setting after wearing twice also. Pretty, but cheap price=cheap quality. <end>  Beautiul Quality Ring!!  What a great price for a fantastic ring. The color is true to the picture, and I couldn't be happier with the quality. Smooth, comfortable and easy to wear! Wonderful piece. <end>
 B000C77AY0  Authentic Black Hills Gold Sterling-silver onyx Women's Heart Earrings ||	  Cute!  My mom loves onyx earrings, so I bought these earrings for her for Mother's Day. My mom's tough to shop for but this is probably one of the top 3 gifts I've ever given her that she really loved and loves to wear. They are even prettier in person. Great service, very beautiful earrings. <end>
 B000C78U1W  Sterling Silver, Sugilite, Lapis, and Mother of Pearl Mosaic Inlay Celestial Stallion Pin ||	  Silver PIN  This pin is very cute, but so small, I wish they had a picture of the real size of the pin, because it was kind of disappointment when I opened the big huge box where the pin comes in... <end>
 B000C8OTAC  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 2 CTW Round Brilliant Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish 3mm Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  The Most Beautiful Ring That Gem Avenue Sells  This ring of all the rings that I have purchased from Gem Avenue is by far my favorite. It reminds me of a Tiffany style that I have seen through the years. Friends are amazed when I say it is CZ. <end>  Too big for my tastes  I do like the ring, it is very pretty. I did not carefully read the size of the CZ on the ring. It is too big for my personal taste. If you like bling...this will be your thing. I like Gem Avenue's service and selection so I ordered a new ring with a smaller CZ. I like simplicity in jewelry. If you like a bigger sparkle then this will be the ring for you. It is very pretty and I do like the design of the ring. It was true to size and came in a lovely little box with a bow. <end>  Fabulous!!!  When I ordered this ring, it was not what I expected. Even better. I am very pleased with the way it looks and I love the style. I get more compliments on this ring than my actual wedding ring. <end>

I am extremely happy with my purchase. <end>  necklas  I was very happy with the item I wear it all the time and I get a lot of compliments great price great quality great item thanks <end>  gorgeous silver necklace, really like it.  I ordered two of these necklaces for a pendant I have, and really like them. The quality's lovely, and they're really pretty. <end>  Not worth the price.  The chain is rather thin and almost white looking rather than silvery. I had to return it because it was not worth $80 and the ring of the lobster clasp was missing. Dealing with the seller was a problem. I did not get a response for return authorization until I reported them to Amazon. Now I am waiting for my money to be returned after 4 weeks. What is going on with this seller. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! <end>  Amazing chain  I love my chain!! It is a replacement of one that my mom got me over 10 years ago that finally broke. I am more happy with this chain than the last. I love that I bought it and the amazingly fast shipping was a plus. Thank you for helping replace a sentimental piece of jewelry. <end>  Nice looking chain, but color not silver  This is a nicely made, solid chain and works well with heavier pendants. However it is very white in color, not a true silver color at all-- so it looks a little "off" with a silver pendant hanging from it <end>  Awesome necklace!  This is an awesome neck chain; the price was excellent for the quality; the quality is top of the line. I couldn't ask for a better value. I purchased it for a Judith Ripka key pendant, and I wear the pair together often, and they look fabulous! Nice going. <end>  no a true 9"  the bracelet was not a true 9 " the necklace perfect the bracelet nice quality just not true to length <end>  Silver Chain Beautiful but Construction Around Clasp was Weak.  The rope chain was beautiful and had a nice weight and sheen to it, but it fell apart at the clasp and I had to have it re-soldered which cost me $25. Now that it is repaired, I love it. <end>

I am extremely happy with my purchase. <end>  necklas  I was very happy with the item I wear it all the time and I get a lot of compliments great price great quality great item thanks <end>  gorgeous silver necklace, really like it.  I ordered two of these necklaces for a pendant I have, and really like them. The quality's lovely, and they're really pretty. <end>  Not worth the price.  The chain is rather thin and almost white looking rather than silvery. I had to return it because it was not worth $80 and the ring of the lobster clasp was missing. Dealing with the seller was a problem. I did not get a response for return authorization until I reported them to Amazon. Now I am waiting for my money to be returned after 4 weeks. What is going on with this seller. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! <end>  Amazing chain  I love my chain!! It is a replacement of one that my mom got me over 10 years ago that finally broke. I am more happy with this chain than the last. I love that I bought it and the amazingly fast shipping was a plus. Thank you for helping replace a sentimental piece of jewelry. <end>  Nice looking chain, but color not silver  This is a nicely made, solid chain and works well with heavier pendants. However it is very white in color, not a true silver color at all-- so it looks a little "off" with a silver pendant hanging from it <end>  Awesome necklace!

I'm VERY pleased! <end>  Regretted paying a penny for this item.  Bought this piece of jewelry and within 2 weeks it was black. What a waste of money. <end>
 B000CBJJX6  Anti-Tarnish Sterling Silver Genuine Green Kyanite, Aventurine, and Freshwater Pearl Hook Earrings ||	  nice quality  The kyanite rectangles are lighter and cloudier than depicted. Quality silver, freshwater pearls and aventuring beads. Overall, quite attractive and good quality for the price. <end>  Green Kyanite beauties  My earrings are a lighter shade of green than the photo. Actually, I have seen green Kyanite in other settings and my pair is the same shade. The earrings are beautiful and I receive many compliments. <end>  How big are your ears?  I've ordered quite a few pairs of earrings so far(at least 50) and one thing I've noticed is the great variation in the size of the hooks, And they are not necessarily in proportion to the size of the earring. These earrings have small hooks compared to the other 3 pairs that I ordered from Silver Insanity at the same time. To some of you, thismight make a difference in the way they fit or don't fit your ears. The Kyanite in my pair is the same color as the smaller Aventurine beads and is much more transparent, though still a little cloudy. I think I would prefer the color that is shown. Another thing  I got 4 pairs of earrings and instead of them each having their own gift box, they were in little plastic bags and were all stuffed into one gift pouch. Yet the last order arrived with each pair of earrings in it's own pouch. There seems to be no consistency from one supplier to the next. Obviously there are no rules or guidelines for them to follow and why not Amazon? Just like some of the earring sizes are not provided, making you guess at the lenght of the earrings. Why is this not mandantory? Help us out here, won't you? They still are very pretty and oh, so summery. Very pastel and cool looking with that perfect outfit. <end>
 B000CBKZUM  Sterling Silver Rose Quartz Heart Leverback Earrings ||	  Very pretty  These earrings are very pretty and light to wear, as mentioned in the previous review. They are a bit bigger than they appear in the picture, but beautiful nonetheless. <end>  Wonderful Quality  Beautifully made and light to wear these earrings were bought to go with a rose quartz necklace. The color match was perfect and the quality wonderful. I will certainly buy jewelry from this merchant again! <end>  Rose Quartz heart shaped drop earrings  These earrings are absolutely beautiful! So feminine and pretty. Love to wear them. I am looking to purchase a ring or bracelet to go with them.Silver Insanity is just wonderful. They are fast, and I mean FAST, in delivery time of their products. I was expecting to wait a while for delivery. They came within the week I had ordered them. <end>  just soso  Again another rose quartz item that just doesn't have enough color. aside from that these earrings are well made...oh well <end>  WOW...I LOVE IT!!!  I'm dumfounded!!! I ordered this Saturday morning and got this in the mail on Wednesday, it's not even a week and it had beaten the expected delivery date! The other customer was right with the FAST shipment.I have been wearing this earrings 2 days now and I have no plans of changing it. It's my everyday go-to earrings being so light, it's not even pulling my ear down. Very pretty, very feminine....I LOVE IT!!! <end>

 B000CBSDGU  Genuine Rainbow Moonstone and Green Peridot Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  instant favorite!  These are very pretty earrings. Just right and not too heavy. The moonstones are beautiful and the peridots are very nice accents. A good choice. <end>  Sparkle AND Shine  The moonstones on these earrings have a luster and shine that usually is only found with far more expensive rainbow moonstones of the same size. The peridot adds a nice pop and sparkle. <end>  Great quality and a great price  These earrings are even better looking in person. You can't beat the quality for the price! They are beautiful earrings. <end>  peridot & moonstone earrings  I seem to be drawn to jewelry from Silver Insanity. These earrings were so pretty and my daughter-in-law loved them! I like the prices and styles of jewelty from this company, and these earrings shipped the day after I made my order and arrived in less than a week. I would recommend this particular shop if you are looking for good quality, different, and reasonably priced jewelry. <end>  Beautiful Earrings  I love these earrings! They are the perfect size. My only complaint is that the stones have inclusions, but you cannot tell without REALLY looking close. <end>  Gorgeous  I just purchased these rainbow moonstone earrings because I had a gift card for my birthday. These earrings are gorgeous! The metal is shiny and not flawed, and the moonstone as well as the period are genuine and very pretty. I love the two stones together, it's hard to find two of my favorite stones in the same piece!! Excellent purchase and excellent shipping, got them 2 days earlier than predicted! Highly recommend these!! <end>  Just beautiful!  I just love these earrings! they are high quality, solid with silver. The price can't be beat either! I would recommend these to anyone. <end>  Wife Loves These!  I got these in a few days ago and my wife loves these.Very pretty earrings.Very nice almost Opal looking. <end>  Moonstone earrings  Very nice. I like the peridot addition to add a little extra detail. Given as a gift. The receiver was very happy with the earrings. <end>  Sterling Silver Earrings  Genuine Rainbow Moonstone and Green Peridot Sterling Silver EarringsThese are lovely moonstone/peridot earrings. 5 stars! <end>
 B000CBY3J6  Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst Heart Pendant Necklace ||	  nice necklace  This necklace is very pretty and it was a gift for my daughter. She likes it a lot.

 B000CD66NU  Sterling Silver Amber Sunflower Brooch ||	  Waste of money bad purchase  That was a disappointment. The 'silver' looks like thin tinplate. Far too cheap to look at. It looked much better on the picture <end>  Love this pin!  I bought this pin because I love Sunflowers. I've worn this pin on my casual and professional blazers and I get compliments every time. Its difficult to please me when it comes to lapel pins and brooches but overall I am very satisfied with my purchase! <end>

 B000CDW9Q8  AugustinaJewelry Freshwater Cultured Oval Shape 10-11mm White Pearl Pendant with 18K White Gold, 16" 14K White Gold Chain ||	  not worth it  Bought my wife this charm for a stuffer.

 B000CDZQTK  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Heart Lavender Cubic Zirconia Post Back Stud Earrings ||	  Pleasantly Surprised  I ordered these earrings for my niece (they were on her wish list) and I was pleasantly surprised that when I received them I found that the quality was much nicer in person than seen in the photos. They were perfect little stocking stuffers. <end>
 B000CDZS0M  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Teardrop Shaped Lavender Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Marcasite Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Love this ring!  This ring is as pretty as I thought it would be. I had to send it back to get a smaller size and I can't wait to get it back. <end>  Poor Quality  This ring is beautiful but has very poor quality. I wore it for a week (no heavy wear and tear or anything) and TWO of the marcasite stones have fallen out. Definitely a disappointment. Will probably never order from Gem Avenue again since they lack quality. Would not recommend- don't waste your money! <end>  I LOVE this ring.  )  This Gem Avenue ring is so beautiful and fits my hand very well. The stone is a nice light purple, as described like lavender. As for the band itself, it is very sturdy and could be worn daily. Very pleased with this purchase and would recommend to others. Might buy another for mom!  ) <end>  Picture doesn't do it justice...  I ordered this ring on the 6th of March, I got it today on the 11th. I bought this as a gift for my mother, it is beautiful, the lavender and marcasite really clash together well, the result being a unique ring that you won't really find in stores. I love this ring, as did the recipient, it definitely looks more expensive than what it cost. <end>  So beautiful!!!  I love this ring!! The stone is very sparkly and shines nicely. The stone is also a little bigger than i expected it to be (a little bit smaller than a sunflower seed shell). However, it's a beautiful lavender and i get many compliments on it. <end>  Lovely Lavender Ring  This marcasite and lavender ring is a beauty. The colors are a lovely combination. The lavender is unusually beautiful and has many shades and colors within it. This ring can be worn two ways, pointing up or down, which makes it even more special. I doubt you'll run into anyone with a ring like this. It's much more beautiful in person and very well made. I highly recommend it! <end>  Fine ring, great price  This is the second ring I purchased for another cousin.I purchased this ring for my cousin who is a first time mom. I wanted something elegant and classy for her to remember this special time in her life. I chose this ring because it is simple yet unique. Gem avenue has an excellent selection of rings in the sizes I needed, not many places carry rings that are over size 8. We wear 9 or 10 ring sizes and this item is so great because we did not have to get the ring sized. The price was great too and I am very happy with the quality of the ring and the color is great. <end>
 B000CDZSJS  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Rhodium Square Shaped Pink Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Slim Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7 ,8, 9, 10 ||	  very upset  When the ring came I thought it was beautiful but I noticed that some of the gems were loose. The NEXT day I wore it around and noticed one of the pink gems had already fallen out. A total waste of money. <end>  Wonderful Ring  This ring is beautiful worn separately or stacked, nice color and stone quality, fun to wear, fast shipping, already received lots of compliments <end>  pink and white cz ring  This is a very pretty ring. The pink stones are pale, but beautiful, and the overall look is lovely. Feels slightly loose for a size 5, but not so much that it is falling off. Great ring that looks good with anything. <end>  Gorgeous  I LOVE this ring. The colors and vibrancy are perfect. Pink is my favorite color! It is slim. I wear it on my middle finger with a ring on my ring finger also. So it is perfect for using with multiple rings. <end>  Better than expected!!  I love this ring. Slim nice color and feeling. Even better you can use several together. I recommend it. <end>  Very Nice Ring. I love it.  I ordered all together 4 rings and I love them all.I try and wear them when I can.Thanks again for doing business with me.It is very pretty and sexy looking.Thankslara38d@yahoo.com <end>
 B000CE8DSU  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 22 Inch 6-7mm Black Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Product beyond expectations  Their product is better than it appears on the website, excellent quality, outstanding price, and receipt within just a few days. <end>  Not as pictured  Very nice quality, good value, but colour is brown; not gray, nor black, as photographed. Slightly larger than seed pearls. <end>  good price  The price was amazing, and it looks good quality too! the only reason for the 3 stars was because within a couple hours of wearing it the clasp broke, but the company is very nice and offered to fix it asap. <end>
 B000CE8DTY  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 22 Inch 7-8mm white Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Beautiful Pearls  These are beautiful pearls. I have received many compliments when I wear them. These pearls were an exceptional price to be the quality they are. <end>  pearls  I am delighted with these pearls. Am not a jewelry expert but have a good natural eye and I really like the way these look. They are very light colored (not beige or pink) and bright and pretty against my neck and clothing. And a good length. Very pleased. <end>  very elegant  delighted with my purchase, they hang perfectly and look so elegant, they are not to small or to big just the right size! <end>
 B000CE8DV2  AugustinaJewelry Triple Strand 16-18 Inches 6-7mm Pink Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Beautiful pink pearls!  Love the pink pearls! They give your face a glow. They are very lovely. <end>
 B000CE8HRC  Turquoise Blue Multistrand Beaded Wire Collar Necklace ||	  Pretty necklace  I purchased this necklace and like it very much. The beads are coordinated blue colors with varying opaqueness. They are a good weight - heavy enough to not feel cheap, but not too heavy to weigh down the pretty curved lines of the necklace. Plus the necklace is short enough that you don't need a super-low cut shirt/dress to have it lay nicely on your neck.A couple of issues  the wire used as the base of the necklace is a little bit itchy, but not enough to make me not wear it. Also, the first day I purchased the necklace, the wires came undone from the clasp. However, I contacted the seller and they shipped me a new necklace within three business day. The whole process was simple and painless, which I really appreciate. <end>  A good investment  I bought this necklce not too long ago and was surprised to see it arrive so quickly. It is just as beautiful as it is portrayed and I love wearing it! The shipping frightened me a little, though, seeing as there were only two cushon bags and the necklace itself was poorly wrapped. But no damage was done, and I give it five stars!Laura <end>  Lovely necklace!  I got this lovely necklace for my aunt for Xmas and she was delighted with it. I would recommend this seller to anyone! Thanks a million! <end>
 B000CEBO40  Sterling Silver Diamond Cut Scroll Pattern Western Boot Charm ||	  Very good  This charm has a terrific size, it is wonderfully made and, if it becomes available again, I will buy it. I would recommend this charm to anyone. <end>
 B000CECRZU  Twin Strand Blue Ice Braided Collar Necklace ||	  Super cheap, not as dressy as I'd hoped  This is a fun casual necklace...not quite what I was looking for.I thought the beads were stranded on silver (or at least metal), not cotton twine. Tough to tell from the picture, and I can't recall that it was stated in the product description. <end>  Exactly what i wanted  Thanks to the previous review, i knew exactly what this necklace would be. still i really like the high quality of the beads (handmade glass i think). they're really pretty and look great with blue eyes or for someone with light skin.would for sure consider buying again (this was a gift...now i want one for myself). came on time. THANKS!!! <end>  Way too tight. More of a choker.  This necklace looks like is hangs on the model in the picture. When I got it it was so tight I felt like I was being strangled. I am severely allergic to metals so I can't make an extender out of wire so I don't know how to let it out a few inches so I don't feel like I am being choked. It is very pretty and I got it b/c I can't wear tradtional necklaces beause of a nickel and metal alloy neckalce. <end>
 B000CECS04  Twin Strand Turquoise Blue Braided Collar Necklace ||	  Nice  It's a nice piece of fashion jewelry and looks pretty nice if you are wearing a full white outfit. The price wasn't bad either. <end>
 B000CECS0Y  Blue Sky Beaded Slab Necklace ||	  My mother ganked this from me!  Not one hour out of the package, this necklace got ganked! In other words, my mother really admired this necklace so much so that she took it off my hands. Actually, I gave it to her since she liked it so much, but I had it on for only a couple of minutes, and now I no longer own it. It is a nice necklace, and it looked like it did on the girl in the picture. If it didn't, I was going to get crazy and tell NVie Designs about themselves! I am a little paranoid because I am (much) larger than the girl in the picture and just assumed that this blue slab necklace might look like a choker on me. But, whew, thankfully it does not. Another thing about the girl in the picture. She is wearing it with a white button down shirt. My mother is going to wear hers with a little black dress (also formerly mine) on her cruise this summer. The blue beads look really elegant against the black, and the blue slab is a lot more interesting than the typical round pendant. Or maybe I am just traumatized by the jumbo Egyptian Medallion I bought too (also from NVie). My mother didn't take that one. This is a good special occassion necklace. If it breaks or anything like that, I'll come back and report it here. <end>
 B000CEESSE  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 18 Inch 6-7mm pink Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Pretty Pink Pearls  I am updating my jewelry collection and these pearls are perfect for the quality and I got a great price and free shipping.The length is perfect not too long or short and the color is beautiful. I look forward to wearing it with my matching pink pearls. Scale of 1-10-10+. <end>  Perfect Pink Pearls!  These pearls are surprisingly well made for the price! A beautiful peachy-pink color, clasp easy to work. The only tiny problem I had was the clasp became undone just a teeny bit too easily. But overall, this is an amazing gift, or even purchased for yourself. <end>  Beautiful Pearls  I got this for my Mom as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves them. They are a beautiful color, have a nice sheen, and the price can't be beat. She's a breast cancer survivor and loves pink jewelry so this has an even deeper meaning for her. I would definitely recommend this necklace to anyone! <end>  Thank you for the excellent customer service Augustina Jewelery!!  This is a beautiful necklace for the price. We had some issues with the clasp only because our daughter is 1 year old and she pulled on it. When I called the company to ask if they had a stronger clasping system more suitable for babies I was met will outstanding customer service. Although I wouldn't recommend this necklace for your one-year-old I would definitely recommend the company as a whole. I feel very well taken care of & to me customer service is EVERYTHING. <end>
 B000CEESTI  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 22 Inch 8-9mm pink Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  My first foray into pink pearls  I fancy the colour is really more light peach than pink, but it is a pretty, delicate colour that goes well with my complexion (fair-skinned Asian here). The pearls are not perfect - many have obvious striations and a few are slightly blotchy or pocked - although their lustre is quite pleasing. Their individual lengths vary from 8 to 10mm and there are 55 pearls instead of 53 as stated in the description (this is not a complaint - I am simply describing the facts).The one thing that is a big complaint is the way the string of pearls is attached to the clasp at both ends. Each end of the cord is stuck through a little hole in a tiny metal bowl that connects to the rest of the clasp, and is then finished off in a knot. The weight of all the pearls, therefore, hangs suspended on these two tiny end-knots. While it all seems quite secure at this point, I can't help feeling nervous about how long this will last. It's also rather inelegant to have the raw ends of the knots in plain view like that. I see no picture depicting this portion of the necklace; if there had been one, I might not have bought it.At 22 inches, this necklace hangs three fingerbreadths lower than my princess-length ones. I think the extra movement adds a touch of fun to the usual poised restraint of short pearl necklaces. All in all, this necklace makes an OK starter in the world of coloured pearls and I will wear it happily while it lasts. I don't expect that to be forever, but what more could I reasonably ask from a real pearl necklace at this price? <end>  Good Value for the $  not amazing, and not nearly as pink as the picture shows, but a great value! <end>
 B000CEEW58  Twin Strand Earth Tone Braided Collar Necklace ||	  DAZZLING!  I just bought this necklace as a gift for my friend. it's rly pretty adn the orange is really bright. it looks great for people with a darker skin tone. i also really like the clasp which is basically a wrapped cord. looks really good. came on time. would buy again from nvie desings. <end>
 B000CEPKJA  CZ Wedding Rings - Sterling Silver Antique Inspired CZ Wedding Set - Size 5 ||	  Beautifully Elegant  I've been wearing this ring for a little over 4 months now, and I've gotten multiple compliments. It arrived 3 days earlier than expected, and I was very pleased with what I saw upon opening the package. The stones were brilliant and had plenty of sparkle. They still do. The plating around the bottom of the ring has worn away, but I do wear the rings every day and I only take them off when applying moisturizer. The metal around the rest of the ring is still as shiny as ever. I wouldn't recommend this ring for someone with small hands, because the center stone is large. It's not unbelievable large, but I wear a size 8 ring and the center stone is still larger than I expected. All in all this ring is gorgeous, and looks very much like the real thing. In 4 months time I'm still extremly pleased with this set and plan to wear it always. No need to replace it unless my ring size changes. Beautiful, and I'm so pleased with my husband's decision on this ring. It didn't cost a fortune and no one knows the difference. <end>
 B000CEPMRA  Genuine Beaded Turquoise Chips 17" Sterling Silver Necklace ||	  Not like the picture shows!  Sorry, but this necklace looked much bigger in stone size, and larger on lenght in the picture shown. So I was a bit disappointed when it arrived!It certainly is more fitting for a teenager, I think. <end>
 B000CERDN6  Sterling Silver Eternal Celtic Knot 18" Necklace with Genuine Blue Sapphire ||	  Great necklace  This necklace will be a Christmas gift for our daughter. It is very well made in a beautiful design.I collect gemstones and was very happy with the quality of the sapphire in the necklace. I plan on ordering more from this company for not only the great quality, but the fast shipping. Thank you! <end>  sterling silver eternal celtic knot w/ sapphire  This is a lovely piece, even prettier than the pictures showed, and I am very happy with it. <end>  My daughter loved the gift!  This was a gift for our daughter. She called us only a few days after we ordered it thanking us and telling us that she loved it. Thanks for making a purchase easy. <end>  Sterling Silver Eternal Celtic Knot 18" Necklace with Genuine Blue Sapphire Review  I just love this necklace and I haven't taken it off since I bought it. <end>  Celtic Knot Necklace  I enjoy this piece due to its complexity and beauty. The genuine blue sapphire adds charm to its beauty. <end>
 B000CF3MCQ  Ribbed Four Piece Red Enamel Square Silver Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Ready for Red  Seems nobody had these babies for weeks. I collect cufflinks, and I really needed red in my arsenal. The litmus test is in how well they look on a shirt and the answer is very good. A navy blue or charcoal gray suit are good choices for these, coupled with a decent bright red necktie. <end>  Beautiful!  I got these as part of a "thank you" gift for the dads for our wedding. I LOVE THEM!! Our wedding is red and gold, and these will go perfectly.Great quality and classy-looking. <end>  GREAT buy  I bought these for my guy who recently got promoted to a field sales position in the financial industry. He wears cufflinks everyday, but didn't have a red pair. he LOVES them and they look great with his suits! I was afraid they might look cheesy because the price was so low, but it turns out they are just a steal! <end>  Very nice  Very nice red cufflinks. Colors are rich & vibrant. Sale price was great. They also come in a nice gift box. <end>
 B000CF4XSI  Sterling Silver Heart Peace Ankh Oval Cross Earrings ||	  Small but Nice  I was a bit shocked to see how small they were, I expected them to be about quarter size in length, but they were actually more the length of a dime. I collect ankh jewelry and these are nice despite the small size. I especially like the heart in place of the upper loop of the ankh. <end>
 B000CF6R6Y  Beaded choker, 'Thai Floral ||	  Stole the show  I got this for a wedding because the colors were black and turquoise. And when this arrived, my jaw dropped. It is soooo much prettier in person! And it came into this ornate jewelry box that I still use with a little card of information about the craftsman. I got a hundred compliments on the piece. I love it and it quickly became one of my favorite pieces. <end>  Gorgeous Necklace in Turquoise colors  This is a very beautiful necklace. People notice it at once. It is such a dominant piece and the color so good for me that I can get away with wearing clothing that is in trickier colors. For example, I have a beautiful orange caftan. It is very hard for me to pull this off without having this blue turquoise necklace near my face. The outfit totally works with the necklace and does not without it. I do worry a little about the clasp. I've had similar wrap around necklaces which have come off of me and lost them. So I am a little more careful about where I wear it. It came in the most beautiful package or handmade mulberry paper in the shape of an envelope. This would make a fabulous gift. Great value for the price. I got mine cheaper, for $35, over on ebay where I used the MAKE OFFER option. <end>
 B000CFGU66  Cute Stretchy Yellow Jasper Bracelet ||	  Sweet, large, comfortable...  I like it. I know the stretchy cord will break, they always do. Hopefully, when it does, I'll find all the pieces and restring it. <end>
 B000CFKUMG  Cute Stretchy Blue Sodalite Bracelet ||	  Gave it to my Mom  Pretty bracelet. But since the blue (shades vary in gemstones)wasn't quite in my color palette I gave it to my Mom, who hardly wears anything that isn't blue. <end>
 B000CHSK12  Crystal Circlet Cultured Pearl Platinum Overlay Sterling Silver Pendant Necklace, Dyed Black ||	  Beautiful Necklace  I bought the black pearl crystal circlet pendant for a friend. She was thrilled and excited to try it on as soon as she saw it. The black pearl stood out nicely. The silver chain is also very heavy and of good quality. Moreover, it's only $38! (My friend thought it was more than double the price). <end>
 B000CHTYGM  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Large Garnet Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  Beautiful ring  I just bought this ring. It is really beautiful. It is a litttle bigger than i thought it would be but it fits good and was shipped quickly. It was a really good buy. <end>  nice piece  This is a simple, but elegant design. My wife likes it alot...but then that may be due to other factors such as her relationship with the gifter;-) <end>  I love this ring!  This ring is beautiful for the money. It is large and the garnet is a deep wine color with a lot of sparkle to it. The picture does not show how refined the silver work is. It is wonderful quality for the money. I am so happy I ordered it. <end>  Wedding Present...  A beautifully crafted ring that looks just like the picture in person. Getting the right size is crucial. But its a perfect gift. <end>  Cappricorns need to see this!  This ring is beautiful. It is a garnet ring that doesn't scream "I a birthstone ring and I look fake." This ring fits larger than it's sized.The look of it is so pretty. It lays nice and flat but doesn't loose any of it detail. The garnet is dark but I like them way. I like this ring because it isn't your normal birthstone ring it has a classiness to it. <end>  Perfect for everyday  This is a replacement for an identical ring I lost. I was glad to have it backon my finger. <end>
 B000CHW2C0  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Crescent Moon Earrings ||	  Sterling Silver Celtic Earrings  This product was exactly what I wanted. The earrings were described perfectly and I recieved them very quickly. I would do buisiness with this company over and over. <end>  Silver Insanity is the BEST  These earrings are a beautiful addition to my collection. Silver Insanity was one of my favorite sellers on eBay for years. They sell quality jewelry at a good price and ship it fast. <end>  Perfect!  This is another item my husband bought off my Amazon wishlist. I'm enchanted by these earrings! They are good quality silver, a bit on the heavy side, and well-crafted. The lines of the knots are very clear, unlike many Celtic knot pieces. We will be buying more from Silver Insanity in the future. <end>  Smaller but Beautiful  They turned out to be smaller than I expected, but they are so beautiful! The backside looks kinda unfinished, but I guess you aren't really looking at it. They are comfortable and look wonderful. <end>  Lovely  I love these earrings! They are so beautiful, not too big (I hate big earrings) and the design is wonderful. <end>  A bit small, but pretty...  I honestly wear these earrings more often than I ever thought I would. They are pretty small, but the Celtic knots are very much visible as well as all the detail. I should also say that I found these earrings to be very light weight and not heavy at all. These are stamped sterling (.925) on the earwires as well as the moons. I also have to add, that the earrings are flat in the back and only puffy on the front as the pics are somewhat deceiving to the buyer. These also are manufactured by the Peter Stone company who are known for their wonderful designs and quality silver. <end>  perfection!  These earings are perfect! They're beautiful, they're lightweight for my sensitive ears, but they have just enough weight to them that they still hang properly, and they're the perfect size. They are very high quality, as is everything I've seen and purchased from Silver Insanity. I would come back to them again and again. One of the best parts is actually that the hooks are also made of sterling silver, not just silver plated, which is wonderful because I'm painfully allergic to nickel. That's hard to find in online orders. AND they got to me 6 (yes SIX) days before the estimated delivery date! Very fast! Thank you, thank you, thank you Silver Insanity! I love these! ^_^ <end>  Classic  Very nice, especially with the matching necklace. I get compliments whenever I wear them.Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Crescent Moon Pendant with 18" Necklace <end>  Celtic Knot Crescent Moon Earrings  This item was received rather quickly, even though my boyfriend had mistaken the package for something he had ordered for his office. He found the package, realized it was mine and gave it to me. Other than the mistake that occurred at our end, the earrings are beautiful, simple, sophisticated. I ordered them to replace a pair of pentacle earrings (I lost one of them). These earrings are a terrific replacement and go well next to my maple leaf earrings that I wear on a daily basis.)O( <end>  Lovely  I purchased and gave these earrings to my wife for christmas. She is Irish and she loved them .. that should say it all <end>  The Moon is calling  With her cool grace shed upon our face after the long day of blinding light. <end>
 B000CIZ3UC  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Star Peridot Cubic Zirconia Post Stud Earrings ||	  Great deal for cheap  Great deal if you don't have much money to spend I also brought the heart ones as well!!! I was so impressed by the price and how quickly it shipped. <end>
 B000CJ4TQA  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Star Blue Sapphire Cubic Zirconia Post Stud Earrings ||	  Mixed review for earrings  The transaction was quick and the earring were delivered very quickly. However, I was disappointed with the product because I had ordered sapphire blue earrings and the earrings I got were in fact a much lighter blue color that look like aquamarine. The picture is deceiving and the earrings I received are not the color they look. I bought the earrings specifically for the color to match a necklace I have and so it was a big disappointment. However, this is my only complaint and everything else was fine. <end>  Great star earrings  A great size star earring that I got as a birthday present. They are not quite as bright as in the picture but I'm sure they have a bright light behind them when the picture was taken. Still a beautiful color. So happy I had these on my list and I got them! <end>
 B000CJ7BIS  Enhanced Black Cultured Pearl Strand Necklace w. Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Rose Clasp (L1S3R2) ||	  Disappointed  I have a hard time believing that these pearls are AA quality. They are of a very nice size, but every single pearl has significant visible flaws. And the luster is not that amazing. Well, when you wear them, they still look nice, but I believe I could get a better product for the price. Previously I purchased pearls from the Amazon collection that were described as A quality. They are nearly perfect, and the luster is fantastic. I payed for them significantly less than these pearls that I am reviewing. I was torn between keeping or returning them for a while, but I will be traveling for a long time, so it looks like I am stuck with them. <end>  beautiful necklace  I wanted something beautiful and precious for a young person of my family who lives in America, I live in France, so it's difficult to choose far away, I read what you wrote and thought it was the product that will be enjoyed and it was! <end>
 B000CKG4TO  Sterling Silver Yin and yang Surfboard Pendant, 1 3/4 inch tall ||	  Pretty Good Overall  For the price, which was about 17 bux with shipping and handling, the quality's a lot better than some other necklaces of comparable price. Shipping was really fast with this store-it came in about 3 days. I'd recommend a different chain though, because it was really thin. But the piece itself was in really nice condition. Definitely a keeper. <end>
 B000CKI83E  Sterling Silver Bull Pendant, 1 inch tall ||	  Beautiffuly made!  This was ordered for a custom necklace and the customer was thrilled with it. The quality is excellent and I would deinitely recommend.! <end>
 B000CKK5IU  Sterling Silver 4-Leaf Clover Pendant, 3/4 inch tall ||	  Great Shopping Experience  Wonderful shopping experience I purchased the item for holiday presents and the whole order came quickly and in wonderful condition. <end>
 B000CKK5PS  Sterling Silver Peacock Pendant, 1 1/4 inch tall ||	  Nice contrast of light and dark in a piece of silver jewelry  This is an inexpensive, yet well-made silver pendant. It is easily identifiable as a peacock, despite not having any color and being small. The necklace stands out well if you wear it with a dark shirt, and it looks somewhat antiqued. It is one of my favorite pendants. <end>
 B000CKNJ5G  Sterling Silver Green Jade 18 inch Necklace ||	  stunning jade necklace  THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE. THE JADE IS CONSTANT IN COLOR AND THE SILVER WORK IS BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED. I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS ON IT WHEN EVER I WEAR IT.THE COLLAR NECKLACE LAYS WONDERFULLY. <end>
 B000CKTFRM  Sterling Silver Purple Jade 16 inch Necklace ||	  Extremely poor quality and service  I received this necklace as a birthday gift from my daughter. When I tried it on, the clasp and one of the links broke. I sent it back to the west coast and my daughter apparently returned it to Gem Avenue. Yesterday I received a box containing the original broken necklace along with a note that said returns were only good for 30 days. Because of the cross-country travel and busy schedules, 30 days wasn't a realistic turnaround. I now have an extremely tarnished, broken necklace and a form letter from Gem Avenue thanking me for my understanding. I discourage anyone from using this vendor. <end>
 B000CM94H6  Garnet jewelry set, 'Bird of Paradise' ||	  FANTASTIC!!!  Great Buy!! Beautifull pieces, worth 3x the amount I paid. Easy ordering, fast delivery and comes with a fabulous little gift box and paperwork from India. The Gem stones are magnificent brillant deep red, Ladies don't pass on this one!!! <end>
 B000CMFNTO  12mm Square Stainless Steel Ring with Brush Finish ||	  Square Stainless Steel Ring  Very handsome and different with it's square shape and wide enough to be noticed.. Love it! <end>
 B000CO59T6  Earrings, 'Polar Snowflakes' ||	  Dont waise your money...  I bought this, and threw it away... It wasnt worth the postage to sent it back to the wherever it came from. The box it came in was lovely... and the earrings looked like cheap pickNsave junk... dont bother with this. <end>
 B000CO8B0U  Amazon.com  GOLD-Colored Men&#39;s Cuff Links. Turquoise Colored Stones Cufflinks  Clothing ||	  georgeous  I bought a women's long sleeve shirt,with the space for my turquoise links <end>
 B000COSE7U  REVERSIBLE Crystal Passion Pink DAISY Belly Button Ring ||	  Was not pink!!!  Wrong color shipped and it moves too much. I did not see where it was reversible either. At least it was cheap. <end>
 B000COSECK  Passion Pink Gem Dainty Butterfly Belly Button Ring ||	  It seems that theres a stone missing  The ring is cute and delicate but when I got this belly button ring I got disappointed when I noticed that at the top at the butterfly, theres a curved empty space that you cannot really see in the pictures, but when you have it on, it looks like there's a stone missing, but it just the design. Anyway, I guess I should have noticed it before I bought it. The <end>
 B000CPAOWW  "Ms. Sparkle" Earrings (Aqua) ||	  sparkles!  Very sparkly, I'm pleased with them....only bad thing is I expected them to be the same size as the Adriatic rounds, and they were actually smaller.....which super sucks, but still worth it! Like little sparkly jewels in my ears ^^ <end>
 B000CPI7S0  Copper Pearl Floral Dangle Earrings ||	  PERFECT!!  I bought these for my boyfriend's stepmom and she loved them! I had been trying to find a gift that would be perfect but without "trying too hard", ya know? But when I saw them I knew they were going to be the ones. She put them on right away  ) <end>
 B000CQ4YW2  Sterling Silver Sword Pendant, 7/8 inch in width. ||	  Scimitar details terrific!  The scimitar pendant is even more detailed than what appears in the picture online...very nicely done! There was even a simple silver chain included, which I did not realize when I bought the pendant. Most sites have you buy the items separately.Can't wait to give it as a gift! <end>
 B000CQBONO  Exselle Running Horse Earrings - 22 Carat Gold Plate ||	  Great earring for great price  My daughter loved these earings. They are small, but nice enough to be be noticed. <end>
 B000CQG7TA  Sterling Silver & Turquoise Beaded Bracelet ||	  It may be attractive but  Do not expect that clasp to hold your bracelet in place. I bought a similar bracelet from this company and it didn't take long for it to disappear. Even if I find it, will I feel comfortable wearing it again?I suggest if you buy this item, wear it for short periods to single events so you have some control over where it falls off. <end>
 B000CQWQ2C  Mother and Child Keepsake Box - 26608 by Willow Tree ||	  I love this company's style  This company has a style to their work that I really like. I had purchased a different piece made by them for my wife when I found out she was pregnant and this matched perfectly. I used it as a gift box to give her a mother and child locket when my son was born and it worked out perfect. If you like their art style you will be real happy with this piece. <end>
 B000CQY2DI  Stud Earrings Sterling Silver - Mushrooms ||	  These are pretty nice  I bought these for my daughter to replace another pair that I bought her at the renaissance festival. These were nice but slightly smaller and less heavy. They look good and she likes them alot. I also bought the pendant to match. <end>  Mushroom earrings D  When I first saw these earrings by just searching for mushrooms I was so happy to have come across these ones. They are so darn cute, I get so happy just looking at them. The shipping is fast and they come looking great. The one thing about them that I was a little shocked about was that they are very small, when they mean stud that is what they mean. I don't mind the smallness, it actually enhances the charm of them. It is a great price as well, you cant go wrong with them. The shipping is what makes it a little pricy if I recall. I spent like 11 bucks on them and they only were 5 so the shipping is what makes it a lot. I love the products that silver insanity has, everything is amazing. If you like mushrooms and are looking for little cute stud earrings then you have to get these. <end>
 B000CQY2FQ  Fossil Scorpion - Hemp Necklace ||	  BIG  It is a lot bigger than what I thought. The pendant is about an inch long. Way too big for my liking. (That is NOT what she said... LOL) <end>
 B000CQY2HE  Small Pentacle - Toe Sterling Silver Ring ||	  great jewerly  it is hard to find good pentacles, harder to find discrete items that my teenager can wear and not be trashed for being wiccan. This seller shipped quickly, packaged the item well and sent a quality product. I will definately buy from them again. <end>
 B000CQYHRO  Lavender AAA Cultured Pearl Bracelet w. Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Rose Clasp 7" (LS1R2) ||	  excellent!  i just love pearls! and dahlia jewels takes the most beautiful pearls in beautiful and elegant designs. everyone always asks me where i get my pearls, and i tell them at dahlia jewels! <end>  Beautiful pearls  This product image depicts a daisy clasp and i was sent a rose clasp. Sent it back  ( <end>
 B000CQZZ70  14mm Bali Hoop Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  not very sturdy  I bought these and they were nice enough but they broke within one week just from trying to take them out and put them in.Also shipping form the seller is an extra 5 bucks. <end>  Decent, could be better  Difficult to clip them together once they are through your ears. A decent product, and I would consider buying them again. <end>
 B000CQZZG6  Frogs - Sterling Silver Bracelet ||	  small bracelet  the frogs in the picture are even smaller in person, and the bracelet barley fit in my wrist (i have very small wrists). you should buy an extender for this bracelet just in case. <end>  froggy bracelet  Toadally love this bracelet. Its definitely real sterling silver. Absolutely worth the price . Yhe bracelet id everything it claims to be an more <end>
 B000CR1XDO  14mm Bali Hoop Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Nice Look, Cheap Construction  These are a big pain to get the pin into the hoop to latch them. They bend and it makes it very difficult. They do look nice though. <end>
 B000CR1XFM  Celtic Flower Knot - Stud Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Very pretty  Received the earrings on the first day of the estimated delivery time. Looks like the picture. The only thing negative I have to say about the earrings is that the posts were weak where they connected to the knot and the post broke off from the design. To me it's not that big a deal because I can use it for something else, but for those who are not as crafty as me it might be an issue. Just be careful when removing the back from the post. <end>
 B000CR1XJI  Hemp - Choker Necklace ||	  Hemp-Choker Necklace  This choker was about what I expected . It was a gift for my 17 yr old son who thinks it looks good. It is of average quality, fine for a teen. <end>
 B000CR1XJS  The Stag God Pendant ||	  Second one same as the first  Looks just like the photo. Quality is sturdy. Detail is easily seen based on the black detail and the size. Delivery was prompt. <end>
 B000CR1XL6  Simple Sterling Bracelet Sterling Silver ||	  Cheap but good looking  Can bend this to fit your wrist. It is cheap jewelery but gets the job done. <end>
 B000CR1XPC  Stud Earrings Sterling Silver - Safety Pin ||	  Much smaller than I had anticipated  Maybe I didn't read the description very well but I was very surprised when these arrived. They were very, very tiny. <end>  safety pin earrings  These earrings are very cute, but very small and thin. They are hard to remove from your ears without bending the earrings. I don't think they will last long before they break. If they were a little larger and move durable, they would be perfect. <end>
 B000CR1XQQ  Skull Scorpion - Pendant Necklace Sterling Silver ||	  Like it but it was smaller than expected.  My son loved it but I thought it was bigger. The necklace part of it was rope or rather leather rope but I didn't expect that either. I just thought it would be nicer. But I got exactly what I paid for and for the price it was great. <end>
 B000CR40H0  Celtic Love Knot - Stud Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Curiously small  The picture looks like a relatively classy earring. Not fancy enough for a ball or anything, but sleek and shiny to wear casually out to dinner or everyday swank. However, in person, these are about 1/4 inch in diameter, which makes all of the knotted look disappear if you are not way up close to these earrings. It's a blur of sterling silver, which is perfect, if that's what you want. Price-wise, I was expecting a bargain, but instead I feel like I got what I paid for. <end>  Very pretty  A very pretty and not as often seen Celtic knot design. Love the detail put into it. Arrived the first day of the estimated delivery time. Love to wear them with my other Celtic jewelry that I have collected over the years. A very happy and satisfied customer! <end>  Expedient Delivery  I was told by amazon that the earliest I would receive these was going to be on the 20th, but I received them today, the 19th. They are a little smaller than I thought they would, but overall I am happy. I have very sensitive ears. They puss out and swell up, but I have had these in for a good six hours and my ears are doing perfectly. Usually they start swelling up within half an hour. They are also really beautiful! I love them! <end>
 B000CR40HU  Glass Pendant On Fimo Necklace ||	  exactly as described  My wife asked me to buy her this, I did and she is very happy with it <end>
 B000CR40L6  Sunflowers - Sterling Silver Bracelet ||	  Simple charm bracelet.  Ordered this for my girlfriend for Christmas. Not bad for a cheap charm bracelet but keep in mind that if the person to wear this does not have a small wrist then it will not fit! 2 missing stars because its so small, it barely fits on a tiny wrist.EDIT  I wouldn't get this thing if you are going to be wearing it while doing ANYTHING active... went out to a movie and it broke. it is unwearable now. Good looking but very cheaply made. <end>
 B000CR40R0  Crystal Pendant - Hemp Necklace ||	  its cool  this is a pretty kewl necklace. you have to tie it on. im not sure what the crystal is....quartz maybe? i like it...buy it, u'll like it too...i think <end>
 B000CR4FGG  Enhanced Black Cultured Pearl Bracelet w. Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Rose Clasp 7" (L1S3R2) ||	  Great Buy  This is a great purchase. This was a present for my wife and she did not need pearls uniform in size and color. I like the more natual look of this bracelet. My wife has told me that the internet is the greatest thing that ever happened to my gift giving. Thank you Amazon and Dahalia for making me look good. It was easy and effective. I have bought from other "wholesale" web sites and would rank Dahlia over them in quality, accuracy, cost and service. <end>  A beautiful bracelet!  This is a great bracelet! One of the things that I want in a bracelet is the ability to close the clasp by myself. - I hate to have to throw a bracelet in my pocket or purse and then go to work and ask someone to help me put it on! This clasp is easy to operate one-handed and there is enough "play" in the bracelet that you can do it yourself!The pearls are not perfectly round, but they are a generous size. I've had "enhanced" color pearls before that bled color any time the pearls got any moisture on them. This bracelet doesn't have that problem. The bracelet is easy to wear and looks really nice. I've had a number of nice compliments on it and I wear it often.I would have given the bracelet 5 stars if the pearls had been perfectly round, as shown in the photo on the website.For the money, this is a GREAT bracelet at a very good price. <end>
 B000CRJU7A  Yellow Peridot with CZ Queen of Monrovia Ring ||	  gorgeous ring  this ring is quite beautiful. It is the perfect size and doesnt overwhelm your hand when its worn. If you are looking for a ring that is just enough and sparkles like it is very expensive, this is it! I love mine. <end>
 B000CRNOBI  Touch of Color Evening Ring ||	  Nice, yet bad  Overall the ring looks fine, I think its colorful in good way. However, when I received the ring the middle stone moved. Now I'm left to either pay more to ship it back and hope for a new ring to be returned (hoping it will be made well), or I must have a professional fix it. Either way I don't think its worth any more money to return, or to get fixed. If they would have sent me a good ring that was made well(without moving stones), I would have enjoyed the ring (now its a pain.) <end>  This picture is deceiving.  The colors of this ring are deceiving in this image. I thought this was going to be a fun going out ring, but when I received it, I discovered that the colors are so muted; it looks like an engagement ring. I'm not going to wear a $24.99 engagement ring.If you're looking for a colorful going out ring, this is not it. <end>
 B000CRQQ8Q  Celtic Knot - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  sizes run small  My husband wears a size 10 and the ring was too tight so I now I have a new thumb ring. I guess you shouldn't order some things online. But it is a cute ring <end>  Celtic Band  I purchased this ring for my son and he loves it. He wanted it for a pinky ring. He's happy, I'm happy. <end>  Love my Celtic rings  This ring is beautiful. I love Celtic patterns and silver jewelry. This ring is so perfect for me - and true to size - that I wear it most days of the week. I wasn't sure I'd like this particular pattern or the darkened background, but it's far more attractive in person. <end>
 B000CRQQA4  Moon & Star Wrap - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Cool ring!  I bought this ring a while ago, and it is still in good condition. It fits comfortably on your finger, and you can adjust the size. I'm always getting compliments on it, because it looks pretty cool. <end>
 B000CRQQO0  Inlayed Peace - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Out of the 70's and into the 2000's may all have Peace  A beautiful peace of jewelry that says it all in a vey trying time. May all have peace. What started in the 60's and 70's as a peace movement has now become a cry for existance. May all have peace. This ring is sterling silver with inlayed onyx and is beautifully shined and put together to last a long time. Let it be a symbol to us all that peace needs to be a part of our lives each and every day. Peace Out <end>  nice  yeah I loved the ring but they gave me the wrong size, but in the end I was a good deal <end>
 B000CRQQT0  Skeleton Wrap - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Weak structure  Although I very much like the LOOK of the ring, unfortunately in less than a week, the ring began to lose its shape because of the gap between the heads. Definitely not a ring that can be warn constantly and one that is easily lost or broken. Boo. <end>  Nice Ring  I Bought this ring a few years ago- it's trendy and has a nice appearance, although it does bend (and mine did eventually snap, after heavy use and being beaten up a few times(I'm rough on all my rings)). It's a cool small ring, but I like it nonetheless, and will probably buy another! <end>
 B000CRTH82  Axel - Vertebrae Protector Pewter Ring ||	  High quality, great price!  This ring fits perfectly and comfortably on your finger, given you ordered the proper size. This ring can be worn as a simple or gothic fashion accessory, or as a stage prop for those of you Metalheads out there. Those into the Vampire scene will also find this ring very attractive.Very durable, high quality material. Definitely worth more than $29.95! <end>
 B000CRTHXC  Sterling Silver Ring Seashells - Size 10 ||	  Take yourself to the beach everyday  If everyday were a holiday where would you go? I would go to the beach. So I bought a ring that lets my imagination do just that, it takes me to the beach. This beautiful sterling silver ring full of star fish and sea shells and textures of sand, I look at it and away I go to memories of waves and beaches and sandpipers, and sea gulls and not the paper work, and stress. Let the jewelry take you on a trip where every you want to go. <end>  Seashells Ring  I was searching for a ring exactly like this one for a very long time and when I found it on Amazon.com I ordered it right away. My husband absolutely loves it. The shipment came fast and on time. <end>
 B000CRTJ58  Gecko Wrap - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Too big and rips clothes  I love geckos and thought the ring was awesome so I got it and found that the ring was very big. I ordered a size too small on purpose so I could put it on my pinkie but it's on my thumb because it is huge! Also the ring rips your clothing, bags, or blankets. The feet get caught on the fabric and rip it. I eventually had to completely stop wearing it because it was causing me so many problems. <end>  THE LOVE OF GECKOS  THE RING WAS AN INTERESTING PURCHASE, IT WAS THINNER THAN I HAD THOUGHT, AGAIN , I WISH AMAZON WOULD USE US MEASUREMENTS INSTEAD OF METRIC. THE RING ARRIVED IN GREAT TIME AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. I WOULD PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. <end>  Love this ring!!  This is a really pretty ring!! If you are a gecko fan this ring is a must! I get compliments from people everywhere I go ) The gecko lays very flat on your finger so you won't get it stuck on things. If they make more rings like this with different reptiles I would buy those too ) <end>
 B000CRTJ8U  Triple Spiral - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Never got item  I would love to review this ring, but it never arrived. The ring was intended for a friend as a gift, but the address it was sent to turned out to be wrong, and the item did not forward. I emailed Old Glory twice and explained the problem, figuring the ring must have been returned by the postal service but got no response of any kind. I am now trying to get a refund via Amazon.com, who also have not yet responded. Apparently I am just out the $22 and shipping for a ring that neither my friend nor I ever received. While I appreciate that there was a problem with the address at my end, I have not been able to get as much as a response from Old Glory as to whether or not they got the ring back. I will not purchase another item from Old Glory. <end>  Ring Ring  This is the second ring I have purchased from Old Glory and I'm as pleased with this ring as I was with the first. I think the quality and price of the ring are great. The ring is comfortable to wear and I wouldn't hesitate to go back and check out more products. <end>
 B000CRV97E  Axel Woman Protector Pewter Ring ||	  ring  although the ring is very intrical the sizing is smaller than it claims to be--maybe due to the artwork/design. i suggest you could wear this on the midsection of your finger &lt;as opposed to the traditional third section of your finger or closest to your palm> <end>
 B000CRV99M  Gold Rope Sterling Silver Ring Gold Rope - Size 6 ||	  Great Disappointment  The photo appeared much much much better than the actual product. The actualy product looks and feels like a very cheap thimble. To a point it feels as if the photo and the actual product are two different things.The delivery service form the seller is good and their other products are quite satisfactory. For the reputation, please becareful with the photo image and the actual product quality. <end>
 B000CRV9J2  Chain Link - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  love it  I bought this during my ring phase. Bought a lot of rings during that period.I first saw this on amazon just browsing through stuff and thought it was so different looking.So i grabbed a credit card and ordered it right away.Got the ring size wrong, as I didn't know my ring size and it was too big, but it fit my middle fingerso no worries.I love it. It holds up great. Took it to work where i lifted and scratched it against things and it held up great.It's a big heavy because it's bulky, but it's a great ring. Held up for a very long time when my other ringsbroke or faded out or whatever. Took the pain and never flinched.I still have it and wear it, and it still looks great and is in great condition.I would recommend this product because it holds up great, for the worker and it looks great. <end>  Good casual ring  The sizing of this ring ran a bit small. I actually had to send back and reorder a larger size. This could be because the ring is rather wide. It is nicely made and has held up for over a year of near constant wear. Be aware that the space between the links is a dark and the overall look is rough, not a smooth link. This is more of a "tough" style than a polished finish look. <end>  Average  When I bought this ring I thought it was actually going to be a chain like my last ring of this style but instead it is just a hardened ring with design of a chian and not really a loose chain. <end>  sterling silver ring  Purchased as a gift not yet given. Quality seems very nice. I don't feel one should have to write a comment of a certain length before being accepted for publication. <end>  This is a neat design!  This is a neat ring! the design is different from anything I've seen around here, and it is great as either a finger or thumb ring. this is a heavier ring, so it feels more heavy on the finger, but, overall, I really enjoy it! <end>  Love this ring  I just replaced this ring from Old Glory. I lost my first one. People love it and so do I. I am glad to have it back. Looks very good. <end>  Misleading  I have just received this ring today and upon opening its package my first thought was  "Is this a joke? Did they send me the wrong ring??"Take a close look at the picture and what do you see? You see a very, very heavy looking ring that looks like it can take a beating. What do you get when you actually get this ring? You get a thin little band that is slightly less then 7mm wide. 7 millimeter = 0.7 centimeters!! How do I know this so easily? Because I have rings that are 7mm wide and this is not even that wide in comparison! So thats right! You get a ring that is less than 1 CENTIMETER WIDE!My advice, look elsewhere for a ring. This thing is so frail that I could snap it between two fingers. I have had this ring in my wishlist for almost 2 years now and when I finally break down and order it, I find out that it looks absolutely nothing like the picture advertises. Talk about severe disappointment. Old Glory, you have lost a customer today with me. <end>
 B000CRVAB4  Large & Small Braid - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Missing Link  This is an overall good product, however the way the picture is situated you can't tell that the design doesn't go all the way around. It also stays shiny for a while but then has be cleaned. <end>
 B000CRVAOG  Inlayed Moon & Star - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Ok  We were happy with the quality on the first ring we received, However it was the wrong size. So we sent it back and got a smaller size that was too big. Then we sent it back and got a half size bigger and that was too big. By that time we gave up and used masking tape on the ring. The other down size was the enamel on the ring we kept wasn't even filled in all the way. So overall I wasn't that happy. I gave 3 stars because my husband was happy to have it. Also the price was good, but not after sending the ring back so many times. <end>  It was like what I expect.  I really do liked the ring. It was exactly the same ring that I was looking for. The only thing that it wasn't as good as the shape of the ring is the metal of the ring.based on the price it's the perfect ring. However I think the metal wasn't that good. by the time I'm afraid the ring will lose its shape and its quality. for sure everything has lifetime but still they could made the ring with a better metal. I really appreciate the fast of the delivery and the size was just perfect. <end>  Ring size  I like the ring very much,it was just the wrong size. It is not your fault though, I didn't specify the size. <end>  islamic ring  the ring was beautifil i love it - the size could come a little bigger though <end>
 B000CRXC5G  Skulls & Crossbones - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Skull and Crossbones Ring  Nice sterling silver ring. Fit perfectly. Exactly what I wanted. Provided a great gift for a friend. Highly recommended. <end>  Rockin and Well made!  My husband and son race for who gets to wear this piece (I just sit back and laugh at the humor of it all) <end>  skull ring  I recieved my package fast and It was just like the picture. No problems what so ever. <end>  I get compliments all the time  People ask me if its custom and how much it cost all the time. It is cool. <end>
 B000CRXC6A  Loving Heart - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Not as it looks...  The picture displayed shows a small, very shiny heart. However, the ring I received was a lot bigger, more gaudy, and almost black. I tried to shine the ring with silver cream, but it didn't help its looks at all. Also, the ring doesn't lay very flat to your finger, it sticks off and can be annoying. <end>
 B000CRXCBU  Egyptian Scarab - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Scarab ring  I actually bought this ring in a store in Canada years ago and lost it at a party recently so I was amazed to find it online. I ordered the size I'd worn previously on my thumb (size 7) but when it arrived it only fit my ring finger. I took it to a jewelry store and they said it was actually a 6.5. If I could do it again, I would ask for a true 7 because with the smaller ring the beetle actually looks more like a cockroach. I am still happy with the purchase. <end>  poor product  This probably wouldnt be a bad product, except I dont think its real silver. It turned my finger green-I have purchased other products from amazon with no problem. This product could have been better. <end>  cheap cheap cheap  This is a poorly make product. The shank broke the secpnd time i wore it. <end>  it is what i expected  This ring is exactly what i expected it to be, for THE PRICE. It looked exactly like the photo and for this reason I am very satisfied. Smooth and feels good on, as well. <end>  scrab ring  I love my scrab ring. I have received many compliments. The details are great and it got here very quickly. Thanks,Sharon M. <end>
 B000CRXCF6  Five Rope Band - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Okay ring- not the best  I bought this ring a few years back and still wear it every once in a while. It's a thick ring, sterling silver, although feels too light and doesn't quite have the same appearance of a normal sterling silver ring. The rope detail is not that great, and smudged and unclear in parts of the ring (which is hard to tell from the photo). It's an okay ring, but not the best quality in my opinion. <end>
 B000CS1RFW  Center Pearl with Clear CZ lined Yellow Gold plated Ring ||	  Very elegant  This ring was a pleasant surprise for the price. It looks sturdy but dainty. the pearl is not overly sized. The band is georgous. I noticed a stripping of the pearl in the first few days but that was obviously the protective film, as what lies underneath is still shiny and pearly. I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because the sellers should state what type of pearl it is. I think its simulated but I am not sure. I am thinking about buying one more for a gift. Good work Nvie and your delivery time and customer service is commendable. <end>
 B000CSCRLU  Sterling Concha & Multi-Colored Gemstone Earrings ||	  great earings  they came on time and were just like on a display. good business doing. A+ <end>
 B000CSKDPW  Popular Round-cut 14k Yellow-gold 2mm Rope chain 7 inch ||	  14 K Yellow Gold chain necklace  I thought customer service was initially good. The first necklace was lost by FedEx. Another one was shipped. When I received it, it was suppose to have the double locking fold over clasp. It came with the lobster claw clasp. I was told the technician changed it in the product code but failed to change the picture to show the newer clasp. I wanted the double locking fold over clasp because in my experience they last longer than the lobster clasps. My acccount was credited, but they did not credit the $10.05 I spent to ship it back. <end>
 B000CSQNB0  Silver Dangle Cultured Pearl Earrings - Various Pearl Colors ||	  Multi-color Dangle Cultured Pearl Silver Earrings  These are so pretty. The pearls are colored and shaped so nicely, and the silver is beautiful. Love to wear them. <end>  Black & White Silver Dangle Cultured Pearl Earrings  The earrings are gorgeous. However, one of them was missing a string of pearls. This seller, Dahlia, provided wonderful service. They replaced the earrings with courteous service. <end>  Beautiful and worth the money  I got this necklace together with the necklace as a set It's so beautiful and worth the money that I write extra reviews on each individual product to recommend it. The earrings have 10 pearls hanging down from 10 silver chains. Check its matching necklace or the set! The only suggestion to the seller is taking a better picture as it's much prettier than what shows by this picture. <end>  Lovely earrings  These earrings are lovely. They are exactly like the picture, with beautiful pearls that move as you walk or sway. I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Beautiful!  I purchased these, along with the matching necklace, to go with a dress I was planning to wear to a wedding. I had purchased several sets of jewelry and planned to return the ones I did not use. I did not use these for the wedding, but found them to be so lovely that I am keeping them anyway. The dark pearls have varying colors from black to grey to purple to green and will go with a variety of outfits. I think they are lovely and feminine. <end>
 B000E1DCQE  Sterling Silver Gold Mother of Pearl Hoop Earrings ||	  Lovely s.s.earrings  Beautifully crafted earrings, which are good in size but not too big or too long. All in all perfect in design, and fit. Would highly recommend to anyone! <end>
 B000E1U7LW  All Natural Stones Beaded Collar Necklace [Clearance] ||	  grand daughter's delight  This necklace was too small for me, so I gave it to my grand daughter & she adores it! <end>  stoneface  This is a beautiful, choker-style necklace, with beautiful and nicely sized stones. It is a conversation piece, not a piece to be hidden. The colors are not "quite" as bright as pictured, but close and still lovely. Just be aware that it is only 15" neck size. <end>  not so good  It looks old not like a new one. It doesn't look shiny as shown in the picture. <end>  Gorgeous!!  I found this necklace on sale one day while cruising the site it was TOO good a deal to pass up. I have a 16 yr old daughter, and she loves jewlery. She adores this necklace!!The neck band is rather small, but perfectly fitted for a young teen, and the stones are gorgeous and match any combination.This was a steal!! <end>  colorful necklace  It is really a nice necklace. Made from real stones so it is a little heavy. Excellent choice for young girls(7-20's). <end>  cheap quality  This is an all-right item. The color is not as vivid as the picture shown, and the workmanship is poor. I'd only recommend it to someone who is less than 20-year-old. <end>
 B000E3A3W8  SCBR021 .925 Sterling Silver Multicolor Swarowski Crystals 7.5" Bracelet Toggle Clasp MADE WITH SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS ||	  Not so good  This item was definitely NOT what I thought it would be. It was not made with Swarowski crystals, it was made with plastic beads. The Sterling Silver took exactly 1 day to completely tarnish to a very rusty color. I bought it for a gift and obviously could not give it to anyone that I cared even remotely about. Very cheap looking and tacky. Will never purchase anything like this again from this company. <end>  Swaroski Bracelet.  This is beautiful crystal. I bought the set, earrings, pendant, and bracelet. I wear a 7-1/2 size bracelet, but this one is rather hard to put on by yourself with the tight toggle thing. Very nice worn with pink, blue, and/or lavender. You will receive many compliments, but get help getting the bracelet on. <end>  "Crystal"? Really?  This is a bunch of plastic beads stuck to a metal bracelet. You can find much nicer stuff at a craft fair.  -P <end>  LOVED IT!!!  I bought this as a gift for my sis and she woke me up Christmas morning to tell me how much she loved it... Its really nice and am considering getting myself one... its verry sturdy too - I like that.. <end>  Beautiful!  Very happy with this beautiful bracelet- exactly as described! The colors are beautiful! The gift box was a nice touch. <end>  Great!  The item arrived on time and it was in perfect condition. She loved it very much. Four more words... done. <end>  received wrong item  books instead of bracelet  I ordered this bracelet, but instead of bracelet received bunch of paper cover books!I got the return label by e-mail, and returned next day. Still did not get a refund. Same with earrings. I only received the necklace <end>  Lovely Swarowski Crystal Bracelet  Purchased as a Christmas gift, we were extremely pleased when the bracelet arrived - and in time for Christmas!! We were even more pleased when the person for whom the bracelet was purchased opened the gift and was obviously thrilled with it. <end>  Gorgeous!  This is such a pretty bracelet and can be worn with light blue, navy, a variety of purples, or neutrals. It really sparkles! <end>  Pretty Bracelet  I ordered this bracelet as a Christmas present for a friend at work. Super pretty - the colors are awesome! She loves it! <end>  Well worth the money, beautiful!  I am so glad I bought this bracelet! It looks even more beautiful in person than it does on the website. The crystal colors are really nice and the silver looks good too. I bought this as a gift and the person loved it! <end>  Reasonable price, beautiful and sparkly. My GF loved it.  Bought this for my GF. She likes to string Swarovski crystals to make sun catchers, so I thought she'd like this. She did. Her daughter was jealous, so I am buying a 2nd one for her birthday. Very happy so far. <end>  Fabulous bracelet!  This bracelet made a fantastic gift for a good friend of mine, she absolutely adored it! She told me that it caught the light beautifully and sparkled. She is so pleased with it that she has ordered another one in a different colour tone. <end>  Fantastic!!!  Brilliant color and clarity on the gems, adds color and sophistication to an outfit. I got this bracelet and matching earrings for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. It's not bulky, heavy, or irritating, it's beautiful and pleasant to wear. Great craftmanship, quality product, and a great buy!! <end>  A Great Gift with a Reasonable Price!  It is a very beautiful bracelet for the price I paid for ($ 29.99). The crystal is very pretty. I also appreciate the seller's (GEM AVENUE) fast delivery so I was able to give it to my wife as her Christmas surprise on time! <end>  Great Bracelet!  I bought these without expecting much from the quality. However, I was very impressed of how beautiful the piece is and my mother-in-law was very happy to receive it as a gift for her birthday. <end>  Great Jewelry Item  This was an item on my wife's wish list. It was perfect and exactly what she wanted and now loves. I previously purchased another color in this item and both have been terrific. <end>  An easy choice  I'm not always confident in buying gift jewelry for my wife, but this bracelet (as well as several matching pieces from Gem Avenue) have been a huge hit with her. I was surprised at the quality of the bracelet, considering its reasonable price. <end>
 B000E3DNUC  6-Carat Oval-Cut Genuine Mystic Fire Topaz 10k Yellow Gold Solitaire Pendant and Chain 18&quot; ||	  Breath Taking!  I am so very happy with my Mystic Topaz Pendant. It is so very beautiful and the gemstone so heavy. I felt the chain didn't do it justice so I ordered a nicer one and used the other one with a lighter pendant I had. Even though I thought the chain too lightweight I would never return it because the beauty of the gemstone is so very breathtaking! <end>
 B000E3ZS50  Regular Pendulum - Sodalite ||	  Beautiful but the chain was only glued on and broke right after.  I only had it about a month and had not even used it and the chain broke off. I was sad it was beautiful but... <end>
 B000E46M18  Sterling Silver and Dyed Jade Layered Oval Pendant, 18" ||	  Not very pretty necklace  The dyed jade seems of poor quality and is very thin unlike how it appears on the picture. Fortunately I got it for as little as $10 so that it is not worth sending it back. <end>
 B000E48P7C  Sterling Silver and Green Aventurine Layered Oval Pendant, 18" ||	  Pretty necklace  I bought this necklace as a gift, although I would have been happy to recieve it for myself! It is very pretty, I did not expect the silver pieces to be as big as they are, and I'm afraid with wear and figure prints, it will cause the silver to tarnish easily. It will just require some normal cleaning, as is always the case with silver.Overall, a pretty piece! <end>
 B000E48P7M  Sterling Silver and Red Enamel Children's Heart Pendant, 13" ||	  It broke  It is cute but as soon as i got it off the bag the chain broke. It is tiny also. <end>  Children's Necklace  Very nice necklace and very pleased that it is the perfect size for my 4 year old. It's a delicate necklace so care must be taken not to break it, but it's a beautiful necklace for a little girl. <end>  Our's also broke  This appears larger online than in real life.Very cute and my daughter loved it... but it didn't take long before it broke.Unfortunate. <end>
 B000E4ARDC  Sterling Silver Diamond-Accented Triple Heart Pendant, 18 ||	  bsa1arnold  The 3 heart neckless was a good choice to make. My girlfriend loved it. I was just a little disapointed with the symmetry and proportionality for the neckless. <end>  hearts look beautiful chain is pretty cheap  I got it at about $12.5 ($25 with 50% promotion off). So I couldn't expect too much. It is a OK everyday gift, but not a good choice for important occasions. <end>
 B000E4ARFK  Sterling Silver Adjustable Filigree Heart Anklet, 10" ||	  Have a heart!  Item was very light weight and not quite what I expected. Made a nice gift anyway. <end>
 B000E4C9HY  Synthetic blue opal NICKEL FREE 14 karat white gold nose ring ||	  Beautiful nose ring  This is a beautiful nose stud. It's big enough to actually see it but small enough to still be feminine. It's caused no irritation like another 14k nose stud I have that I paid much more for. It fits in so perfectly I can't even feel it. Definitely worth every cent we paid for it. <end>
 B000E7FPEU  Green Jade Solid Capped "Fortune" Rectangle Pendant, 14k Gold ||	  Exactly same as in the picture  It was a gift for my mom. She loved it. Its kind of difficult to review jewelry items because it depends so much on personal taste. All I can say is, the size and the color is exactly the same as in the picture so there were no surprises. It came in a cute little box too. <end>
 B000E7H520  Onyx Stud Earrings, 14k Gold ||	  lovely earrings  The earrings were a gift. My mother loved them. They came in a very cute box. <end>
 B000E7MZYS  Rhodium plated and mother of pearl tie slide with presentation box ||	  Thinner Than I Thought  It is a very distinctive and unique tie slide but it was thinner than I expected. My husband loves it. <end>
 B000E7P374  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Princess Cut 8 x 10mm Pink Topaz Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Rhodium Plated 2.5mm Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Beautiful  My boyfriend gave this ring to me on valentines day and it is beautiful! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wear a size 6 1/2 ring and he got me a 7 and it is a little snug. Besides that it is stunning! The center stone is a bit on the larger side (which I love). The color is really pretty too although when I am in my house it is a bright pink but when I go outside and it hits the sunlight or I am in a bigger room with more light it is a gorgeous light pink color which I think is prettier! Over all I love this ring and would definitely recommend it to a friend. I would just tell them to get one size bigger than what they think they would wear! <end>  If you love pink, this is the ring for you  The ring sparkles and really catches ones eye. You must be a lover of the color pink because it's very pink. I gave it four stars because I didn't realize how pink it really was. But that doesn't stop me from wearing it because it does shine and make you feel like a million bucks. Once again I received it fast. Great company!! <end>  Love a nice pink ring that doesn't turn my finger green!  I was looking for a pink ring that wasn't really cheap and didn't turn my finger green. This ring has worked out for me! I love wearing it. The color of the pink is definitely light or on the soft side so don't expect a really bright/fuchsia sort of color.The sizing runs a little big but it still works out great! Definitely recommend. <end>  Excellent...  I just got my ring earlier today and I absolutely love it!!! It is very pink but I can not stop looking at it!!! If your favorite color is pink, this in definantly the ring for you. <end>  Pretty in pink!  I love this ring! Great deal for a beautiful piece.. I highly recommend buying this ring if your favorite color is pink. <end>  Shockingly Satisfying for $13.99!  I have no idea how they can do what they do at GEM AVENUE for the LOW PRICE. The ring is sleek and modern yet romantic.Looks expensive.The packaging was top notch and the delivery was the fastest of any Amazon purchase that I have made. <end>
 B000E7R54I  Rhodium plated and gold plated dagger tie clip with presentation box ||	  Very nice  I bought this on a whim because I like swords/knives and it's shiny. It looks very nice with all of my suits and ties and whatnot. It's also nice and large, so it looks nice with narrow or wider ties and it's heavy so it doesn't feel like it's going to break if it gets caught on anything.Good buy. <end>  Tie Clip goes on with blade down  This tie clip is beautiful, but unfortunately, when you slide it onto your tie, the blade points down, which is opposite of what you would expect...unfortunately. I am tempted to break the tie clip part off of the sword and have it soldered on in the correct fashion, but that is not the point of buying a $50+ tie clip. Regardless, it looks nice, if you like your sword facing down... <end>
 B000E7YSK2  Amazon.com  SILVER Colored Mens Cuff Links Red Natural Stone Rectangular Cufflinks  Clothing ||	  Happy Boyfriend  I bought these cufflinks for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves them!!! They are really cool looking. <end>
 B000E842RA  Red Jasper Angel on Sterling Silver Snake Chain ||	  Very nice piece of jewelry.  I like the simplicity and beauty of the piece. It is very pretty overall. My only problem really is the way the silver band and the angel are coupled together. I feel that they could have done it better by making the in a loop behind the angel instead of the front. or maybe even used a chain coupled to some other part that is not through the wings. To me it really is just a small detail, but it probably would be a world of a difference to others and it would add a touch of elegance, workmanship. <end>  Unique and beautiful  I gave this to my mom for a gift. She was thrilled with the necklace; liked that it was unusual. She said she gets compliments on it every time she wears it. Some people see it as representing an angel, others see it in a more abstract way. I was impressed with the care taken in packaging and shipping. <end>  Jasper Angel  Anything that has angels in it is my thing. I love this Red Jasper Angel because is a less traditional representation of these celestial creatures. The adjustable snake chain comes in handy as well. This angel is a great conversation piece at a glance some people think it's some sort of a celtic knot and ask me about it then I tell them it's an angel and a conversation just got started. It's certainly an eye catcher and I love it. Check on my customer image above to see for yourself what I'm talking about. <end>
 B000E8UQKC  Sterling Silver Filigree Circle Pendant, 18" ||	  Beautiful Necklace!!  I received this as a Christmas gift from my husband and LOVE IT!! It is very nice quality. Everyone else loves it too, I always get tons of compliments on it. <end>  Very Pretty!  My sister bought this necklace for me several years ago and it looks just as it did when I first received it. The quality of the piece is fantastic and I always receive compliments. It's not labled as a Celtic piece but when I went to Ireland last year, everyone who saw it commented on what a great piece of Celtic art it is! This is one of my favorite necklaces that I wear all of the time! <end>  Great for the price.  I'm always worried that my jewelry will turn. This held its color. I really love it.It's solid, and not too thick. Very pretty.I'm complimented quite frequently when I wear it. <end>  Great necklace for the price  I saw this on one of the daily specials and decided to pick it up for my girlfriend. It has that intricate type of design she likes, which reminds me of celtic type jewelry.The clasp on the chain is a little hard to get on. There isn't much room for error, so a steady hand and a little patience will get it.Other than that slight problem she loves the necklace. <end>  PRETTIER IN PERSON  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it is much prettier in person. It is very versatile, it looks great with both dressy, business and casual attire, very feminine. She loves it and it was a great price. <end>  nice quality for the price!  This was a present for my step mother-in-law for Christmas. It was a lovely piece of jewelry and nice quality. The chain seemed to be a strong smooth link chain and the pendant was of a quality weight. Not too heavy, but not a cheap item either! I may even order it for myself! <end>  Stunning  I bought this as a gift for my adult daughter. When it came, I thought "WOW", it is really gorgeous. I should have bought one for myself. Delicate and lacy looking, really catches the eye. <end>  Excellent product  Very pretty pendant. My wife wears it all the time. One of the best gifts I have bought and very reasonably priced. <end>  Love the necklace!  I get compliments every time I wear this necklace. It has quickly become a part of my everyday wear! <end>  Wonderful gift!  My sister got this necklace for my birthday last year & I LOVE it. I get compliments on it all the time and it's just beautiful on. In addition, I have a 2 year old who pulls on it and the chain is sturdy enough to take the tugging. <end>  Amazing deal, even after 10 months  I bought this pendant for my girlfriend for valentine's day.She loves sterling silver jewelry, so I picked this pendant out of the crowd because of it's oval shape (I figured it wouldn't get caught on things if it didn't have snaggy edges) and cool celtic-ish knots...Anyway, she really loves it and wears it almost every day. It has held up very well and for what I paid for it I feel the value is just through the roof. I'm buying her the matching earrings for Christmas... and hopefully those will go over as well as the pendant did! <end>  Cheap, but good...  Makes you wonder about the mark-up on equal quality/type goods from the expensive "brand names." (At this price, you can't go wrong.) <end>  Pleasing to the eye & wallet!!  )  This is a great necklace for a cheap price. I found that you can wear a variety of earrings with it and it looks great. I was pleased with my purchase, the packaging it came in, and would recommend it to anyone. As some other people said...it is a lighter weight piece but it is real silver and you would pay a much higher price for a heavy silver pendant. Buy it and enjoy! <end>  Gets lots of compliments  I love this necklace. Everytime I wear it someone admires it. The chain & pendant are both good quality. The filigree on the pendant is very detailed & it is good weight not flimsy at all. I am very happy with this purchase as with all my amazon silver purchases. <end>  Sterling Silver Filigree Circle pendant  the pendant was beautiful and was loved by the person I gave it to. <end>  Replace the chain  I love the look of the pendant and got many compliments when I wore it, but the chain gets wrapped up in my hair and ends up pulling out a big tangle. If your hair is long, beware! I will have to try to replace the chain with something that doesn't latch on. <end>  Delighted with silver filigree circle pendant!  The filigree pendant was my Mother's Day gift to myself and I was so pleased with my choice. I wear it several days each week and always receive compliments on the intricate design. Thank you! <end>  Too light  I thought this pendant would be bigger and heavier, but it's so light it moves around on it's chain throughout the day. It's pretty, but not as nice as I expected. I don't think I'll be buying jewelry I can't try on beforehand anymore. <end>  ....looks good to me  ....will be given away as a gift. I am pleased. I hope the receiver will be.I like the chain which I believe can worn separately or with another item? <end>  beautiful, but with a little less detail than expected  The necklace is very beautiful and feminine - though I was hoping for a little more detail. <end>  Sterling Silver Filigree Circle Pendant, 18"  The service was prompt and the product was in great condition.Thanks!R. Caspers5 out of 5 stars... <end>  excellent service  This item arrived in a timely manner, extremely well-packaged and exactly as advertised. A++++ <end>  nice  The perfect size, design, and style. She loved it. It went perfect with the sterling silver cuff that I purchased from Amazon too. A sure fire way to have your bases covered! <end>  love it  was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this pendant for the price. very comfortable to wear and not too heavy. <end>  Anything Filigree  I've gotten many compliments when I wear this. I love that it is on a &#34;rope&#34; chain. I wear it as often as I can! <end>  I love i!  I have always wanted this necklace but wouldn't give up the money until I saw the fantastic price! Dream come true!! <end>  Very girlish necklace!  Cute, modern, lightweight, beautiful filigree. It looks dainty. Just perfect for my grown daughter who likes solitary pendants. I'm pleased with the purchase. <end>  Looks great  Received this necklace as a gift from my husband. I absolutely love it, though I have one complaint. Due to how it was packaged, the chain is permanently bent in a couple spots. You can't tell while looking at it, but it does bother me that it was received damaged. <end>  Christmas gift my wife loves.  I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.It's much prettier than the picture.The funny thing is after I made the purchase, I was reading the WSJ and there was an ad for Tiffany's and in the picture was the exact design of this pendant except it was jewel incrusted with various colored jewels. Still pretty but probably in the 5 figure price range. <end>  slightly dissapointed  The photo made this pendent look larger and more artistic than it is. I guess I was expecting too much for this price. <end>  Simply beautiful  This is a very nice silver piece. It's beautiful front and back, with a very nice chain. I'm very happy with it! <end>  This is one of my favorite necklaces!  I absolutely love this necklace. It is very well made and looks beautiful on. I get constant compliments on this necklace. Great necklace and the price makes it even better! <end>  BEAUTIFUL!  I was tickled when I received this piece to see that it was made so well. I love the intricate details and I too get "many" compliments on it. Would love matching earrings! <end>  Not for long hair unless you replace the chain  The pendant is very pretty, but I admit I was a little surprised at how big it was (I didn't pay a lot of attention to the measurements). The diameter is a tad over an inch! The pendant itself has a very smooth finish so it does have a machined look rather than a crafted look, but it's still a lovely design.However, the chain, while it looks nice, is absolutely terrible if you have long hair as it catches and tangles hair very badly. Each little subunit of the chain flexes if it's curved (like it is around your neck), and your hair can get trapped in the gaps. I had to cut some hair to remove the necklace; it was tangled up that badly. Part of the price you pay includes the value of the chain, so this really reduces the value of the pendant. <end>  So disappointed  Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. The size of the pendant is alright, but it's paper thin and so cheap looking that it looks like something you might give a child to play with. In fact, I'm sending it to my daughter-in-law to pass on to one of her many young nieces as a stocking stuffer. So very disappointing - and so confusing as to why there were so many favorable comments on it. Sometimes I think the manufacturers pay people to say nice things about lousy products. Save your money and buy something else. <end>  Great Value - Beautiful Piece  I bought this necklace about two years ago and get compliments on it almost everytime I wear it. The weight and quality of it were better than I had expected it to be. Nice size too - big enough that it's easily seen. I love wearing it over a black shirt. The quality of the chain was just as good as the medallion. I have since bought a few other pieces in this same line and have been pleased with everyone. <end>  Disappointed  This necklace disappointing in all ways and looked nothing like the photo. The chain was cheap and stiff while the clasp was loose. The pendant was the most disappointing of all looking more like a flat piece of tin foil with a poorly cut out design. I am returning the piece. <end>  Great pendant  This pendant is beautiful. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little smaller and lighter than I expected, about the size of a 50 cent piece. I like it though. It is shiny silver. Anyway, it comes in a black velvet pouch that is supposed to protect it from the elements, which makes me think it probably eventually tarnishes, although it doesn't look like it would. The chain is very nice. <end>  Gorgeous  I ordered this pendant for myself after my daughter recommended it. She was right. It's gorgeous! <end>  Poor Quality  I was very disappointed in the quality of this necklace. It is very flimsy and lightweight and the chain did not lay flat because it was slightly bent. I returned the necklace and would not recommend it to anyone. <end>  Great gift  My wife loves this pendant. The chain was rather thin so we replaced it but the pendant is a hit. <end>  Well worth the money!  This pendant is stunning. It is a nice size, not too big, not too small. At a very affordable price, you can't go wrong with this one. <end>  Larger than expected but beautiful all the same  I wanted a smaller pendant and didn't take the time to measure in mm how big it was going to be so I was a little disappointed but it is beautiful all the same. I love the chain it came on too. <end>  Disappointed  This is the third time I have purchased this product but I am very disappointed this time. The packaging of this product from my prior two purchases were impeccable and it was a great gift for ladies in any occasions; it came with a little cute pouch made of soft velvet along with a product certification brochure inside the box. But now, despite the product looks the same but the little pouch is replaced with a large cheap looking pouch without any product brochure which makes it look cheap and undesirable... <end>  Pretty Necklace. I like.  I bought this necklace for my girlfriend for Christmas, but Christmas is in three days so she has yet to open it! Being a guy I don't have much sense in jewelry fashion, but I bought this necklace based on all of the rave reviews, and it was very nice on arrival. One thing that I liked  the chain seems very high quality with "Italy" stamped in the metal near the clasp. Hey, if it's comin from Italy you know it's quality. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed if it was stamped "China." haha. Cheers. <end>  Mom loved it! Made a great gift....  I got this for my mother at Christmas and she loved it. You can't help but notice the pendant when she has it on - Very beautiful design, sleek and stylish. She gets compliments everytime she wears it. Even though this was just an extra gift I think it turned out to be one of her favorite things. <end>  Great product for the money  Very pretty... the circle is a nice size (about 1/2 dollar size). Gave it as a gift for my friend's birthday. She really liked it! <end>  very nice, but...  I love the pendant, beautiful and solid...but I had purchased it with earrings for my sisters for my wedding. After the pendants arrived, I was told the earrings had become unavailable. What good is just a necklace? Keep this in mind if you wear sets, like we do. <end>  Too Big!  I hated this thing the minute I got it. I returned it and got burned on the return service with amazon. It's huge. Unless you are a big girl with a big bust, it's gonna look and feel like a rock hanging on you. <end>  light but pretty  I bought this necklace for a Christmas present. The person liked it and has been wearing it.She did complain about the chain catching in her hair. The pendent is smooth and the same on both sides. It is a little lighter than I expected but very pretty. <end>  Very pretty  I gave this to one of my daughters for Christmas and she loved it. This pendant is for someone who likes wearing jewlery of a larger size. Can be worn with casual or derssy. Great price too. <end>  Happy Recipient  I purchased this pendant as a Christmas gift for a young woman whose name I selected as a "Secret Santa". She loved it and wears it frequently! The pendant, a great value, is nicely-made and appears to be of high-quality. Presentation-wise, it arrived boxed, accompanied by a velvet gift bag. Overall, a nice purchase for a happy recipient. <end>  Very Pretty Necklace  I purchased this necklace for my mother-in-law for Christmas. It arrived very quickly and she loves it! <end>  Impressive  I purchased this during a Lightning Deal. Even at the regular price, this piece is a great buy, given the price of silver as of late. It makes an impressive gift presentation, looks expensive. I doubt anyone would be disappointed. If I hadn't purchased it for my daughter, I'd keep it for myself. <end>  Review  The pendant is really nice. A lot of detail. The chain is too short. but easily fixed I bought a longer chain. <end>  My wife loves this piece!  My wife usually wear gold jewelry, but I thought she might enjoy this piece and she does. She has worn it many many times since I gave it to her. It looks especially nice when worn against black. The best part? It's the most inexpensive piece of jewelry I've ever given her! <end>  Very pretty  It's very nice quality. Pendant is a little larger than a quarter, probably about the size of a half dollar. I like the lenth of the chain, too. <end>  Love it!  I LOVE this necklace. It was a birthday gift from a friend and from the moment I saw it I knew I would wear it all the time. I have received so many compliments on this pendant. It looks as fantastic now as it did 2 years ago when I received it. <end>  Dress it Up or Down  I was looking for a nice everyday necklace, and found this one. It's perfect in size and design and I've received a lot of compliments. Very versatile  I wear to work frequently and have been able to wear it with dressier clothes as well. The chain that comes with it is very nice although I would have liked it a little longer. Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Sterling Silver Filigree Circle Pendant  I found the sterling silver chain that came with the pendant to be quite nice and of good quality.I was not as impressed with the pendant itself though, and felt that it did not compliment the quality of the chain. <end>  Nice pendant  I like this pendant. I don't think it is quite as pretty or interesting looking in reality as in the photo on the Amazon site. I'm not sure why that is. It's fine, just a bit generic and not all that eye catching. <end>  BEAUTIFUL CELTIC PENDANT  My daughter gave this pendant to me for Christmas a few years ago. I love it! It is beautifully made and it is the necklace I always chose when I'm wearing silver jewelry. I bought a longer chain (24")-- much better look for the size of the pendant. I'm very picky about the jewelry I wear--I highly recommend this piece. <end>  Beautiful  This necklace is every bit as beautiful in real life as it is in the picture. It goes with a lot of things since it's such a neutral color, and I've gotten many complements about it. Most definitely one of my favorite necklaces! <end>  Lovely piece.  This has become my new favorite. It's the perfect size pendant for me, and the chain length is just right too. It's sturdy and brilliant. Buying jewelry online has often led to disappointment for me, but this was one purchase that exceeded my expectations. <end>  Beautiful Jewelry!  This pendant is perfect - perfect size, perfect weight, etc. It is 1-1/8" diameter & is beautifully detailed. If you are a fan of sterling silver, especially filigree, you will not be disappointed. I have received many compliments. <end>  It's Beautiful  I just love this neclace. It is perfect for casual days and easily moves into dressier times. I get so many compliments, I'm going to get the matching earrings next. <end>  Pretty  I bought this for my friend.I wanted a birthstone for her. I found this, I kept looking for a birthstone, kept coming back to this. I ended up buying both. I like this because it is so pretty. She said there was just something about it that she really really liked. <end>  Exactly as described and it looks great in person  I wasnt expecting much since I got so cheap on a lightning deal, but this is a nice pendant and the rope is a thick short rope the keeps the pendant in view even on shirts and blouses that are not low cut. <end>  Better than the photo  Just received the pendant today. It is really beautiful, even nicer than the photo shows. Great buy. <end>  Beautiful design, but paper thin.  It is a beautiful design and as big as it looks. However it is paper thin. I am keeping it, but not a thick rounded pendant as it looks online. <end>  Excellent quality. Lovely  The necklace was lighter than I thought it would be, but it turned out to be perfect. It was a gift for my daughter and she loves it. <end>  Beautiful!  I really love this necklace. It's a very nice quality piece. The chain itself is worth the price. I've been wearing it every day since I received it. I may buy another for my mother-in-law's birthday! <end>  SS Filigree Circle Pendant xxxx xxxx  I expected a heavier piece. I don't think it is comparable to the cost. Service was excellent. xxx xxxx xxx <end>  Filigree Necklace very nice  I didn't know what the quality of this item would be but I am very well satisfied with it. I also like the cord that comes with it. <end>  Awesome!  Love it! Couldn't be any more happy with my purchase. Great price! Great quality! Love, love, love it! I highly recommend this necklace! <end>  So pretty!  My mother bought this necklace for me for my birthday two years ago. It is such a beautiful necklace and I wear it with so many different things. <end>  Filigree Pendant  This is an excellent value for a sterling silver pendant. Its size (about 1.25 inch in diameter) and circular filigree style looks great with "business casual" or "social event" attire. <end>  Good charm,bad chain  Got for the wife, it looks great and she likes it....but she informed me,the style of chain that it came with gets caught on her hair. When she takes it off some hair comes with it,not good. So she just puts on a different chain when she wants to wear it. I say if the person your buying it for has short hair buy it, but if they have shoulder length hair or longer plan on buying a replacement chain and consider that when looking at the price. <end>  beautiful  looks far more expensive than it is. I have purchased many pendants/necklaces from Amazon as gifts and like every one of them so much I want to keep them all for myself. pictures do not do the items justice. <end>  Nice, Large, Bright Silver, Thin  Nice, Large, Bright Silver and Thin sums it up.This is a nice filigree pendant and large enough to stand out which is what I was looking for. It is a very white silver. It's not as chunky as I would have liked but I can't seem to find one here on Amazon. In the stores, all I find are hearts, hearts and more hearts. This pendant is really, really pretty thin, I was surprised at how thin it was. Turn it sideways and it disappears. The small diameter snake chain is not quite as nice or feminine as I've seen, but it works.I have long hair and didn't find that my hair gets caught in it like some other reviewers mentioned, maybe I'm just more careful keeping my hair to the side when putting it on so that it doesn't get caught in the first place, don't know if this is it or not.All in all, a good value for the price if you want a large sterling silver pendant you can actually see on your neck. <end>  Very Beautiful, Elegant Pendant  I have been thinking about getting this pendant for over a year. Every time I looked at it online, I convinced myself that I had enough jewelry. Last month, I decided to order it, and I am so glad I did! It is a beautiful pendant! It's just like the picture. Not too big, not too small either. Just the right size for a petite woman. It looks exotic. Several of my friends thought I brought it from my trip to Turkey. If you like sophisticated and unique-looking jewelry, don't hesitate to get it! <end>  Striking  Very nice pendant. I am not normally a fan of filigree but this piece is lovely! Would buy again! <end>  Beautiful!!!!  I purchased this necklace for a recent cruise. I wanted something simple yet elegant. After receiving the beautifully wrapped package, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and detailed design. After my return from vacation, I ordered one for my 18 year old daughter. I knew if she didn't have her own; mine would be missing. She loves it as much as I do!!!! <end>  Loved it!  I bought this necklace and the matching earrings. I love them both, and have received a lot of complements on the set. <end>  lovely [=  i got this for christmas and it is BEAUTiFUL!. i got compliments from all of my friends. the chain is very sturdy also. you should buy this for yourself or anyone. it's a GREAT gift! <end>  nice pendant but a junky chain  The pendant is pretty and has fairly nice craftsmanship. But I could not give this as a gift because the snake chain is a poor quality - stiff, with several lumpy areas - and needs to be replaced.I don't think the pendant is worth the price if it needs a new chain, so it will be returned. <end>  Still love it after a year!  My husband bought this necklace for me last Christmas, and I still love wearing it. I wear it at least twice a week. People frequently comment on how much they like it. The only thing I don't like about it is that the chain sometimes tangles my hair around it at the nape of my neck--ouch! But that is a small price to pay for how nice it looks. <end>  Beautiful  I love this pendant. Very shiny and substantial - the back looks as good as the front. I also wear this on a black leather cord (16") and it gives it a whole new look. Great buy. <end>  A BEAUTIFUL PRESENT  An absolutely beautiful medallion, and for the price a no-brainer! My wife loved it! <end>

 B000E94XGO  Amazon.com  1655 US Navy Seals Insignia Pin  Clothing ||	  Gold U.S. Navy Seals Insignia Pin  Gold U.S. Navy Seals Insignia Pin This is a very handsome pin and is gold in color and has a very sturdy pin clasp to hold it firmly to what ever fabric you want to attach it to. It fits well on a mens suit or sport jacket lapel, the ladies can wear it on a jacket as well, or be creative. This pin is large enough to be seen and recognized and is heavy for its size, but not so large as to be out of place when worn.I've had several people ask about this pin and they all thought it to be well proportioned to my suit lapel, the construction is very detailed as the insignia shows well.I am very pleased with this pin. The Navy Seals are top notch and this pin is as well... 5 stars. <end>
 B000E9JSAK  Disney Dora Tin Jewelry Box w/ 3 drawers ||	  good barette, play jewelry storage for  my 2-yr-old Dora fan loves her new jewelry box for storing all her little barrettes, hair elastics, & play jewelry - the drawers stick a little & rubber feet to prevent sliding on the bottom (which we'll add in our copious free time!) would be helpful, but there are no sharp edges & overall it's a good 1st jewelry box for a young girly-girl! <end>
 B000E9LSUS  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Clear Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Floral Tarnish Free 4mm Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 ||	  I like it!  I would have to say i was surpised to see the ring the day I was to actually get it! I love the ring. It is sooo pretty just what i thought it would look like in the picture. Thanks Alot! <end>  Pretty but not happy  I ordered these rings for everyday use. The pacakage was beautifully done in a pretty gift box. It has a nice shine and sparkle to it. But I was unhappy with the stone settings. It makes it look fake. Also the size I ordered is slightly loose on my finger. SO I will exchane/return them possibly. <end>  This is just beautiful  This ring set is just lovely...not gaudy or ostentatious...but neither is it tiny. It looks very believable and I wear it every day. Everyone comments on how pretty it is. An excellent value. Almost impossible to tell from real ..I actually like it better because I don't worry about it. I will definitely buy more jewelry from this company for many ocasions. <end>  Love it!  I love this ring. I'd purchased and returned a couple of other rings, none of them from Gem Avenue, before I found this one. It looks just as pretty on my hand as it does in the photo. I've been wearing it for a month now and no sign of tarnish, which is great. It came in a beautiful little ring box, arrived on time and in perfect condition. It's sparkly without being gaudy or cheap. I recommend anyone looking to buy this ring to go ahead and get it, it's great to wear day to day or would also be perfect to have for trips when you want to leave your really expensive jewelry at home.I wouldn't recommend just wearing the engagement ring by itself, the ring definitely looks best when both pieces are worn together. Also, make sure the fit is snug or you'll go crazy trying to keep both pieces lined up together. <end>  This ring is GORGEOUS!  I received the ring in the mail a few days ago and I was absolutely blown away! The ring is gorgeous. It fits perfectly (size 5). It looks REAL and I've already gotten compliments on it. The metal looks like white gold and the stones are gorgeously cut. The only thing is that the design is a bit bigger than I expected because I have small delicate fingers, but nonetheless a gorgeous ring. Well worth the money.Overall, fast delivery, high quality ring, etc. This company is amazing and I'm considering buying more items from Gem Ave. <end>  A lot of sparkle for a great price!  If you want bling on a budget, this is it! I'm not wild about the way the engagement ring looks on its own - it really needs the wedding band to complete it. But I'm definitely going to enjoy fooling my friends! The center stone is roughly half a carat, and each side stone is 1/10, maybe a little larger. The shipping was super fast, too - I ordered it on 1/30 and it arrived on 2/4. WELL worth the $25 price tag! <end>  Wedding Ring, Women's  The ring took a while to arrive, but when it arrived, it was exactly as described. Came in a beautiful heart-shaped ring box with a cute little bow on the top. Very nice packaging. I ordered size 7, which is my actual ring size and it fits exactly right. The ring is beautiful. Several people have seen it on me and think it is the real thing. It looks very real. When I look at it I feel that it doesn't look exactly real, but that is probably because I KNOW it isn't real.I have only been wearing the engagement ring for 11 days and the wedding ring will be a week tomorrow but so far the rings have held up well with no tarnishing and no dulling. The cz's look very real and sparkly.I am happy with the rings and I will be buying more jewelry from this vendor. <end>
 B000EA8K5I  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Antique Finish Toe Ring Daisies Toering ||	  She loved it  I gave it to my girlfriend after she lost hers (or it was stolen when she got a pedicure in Brazil). She loves daisies and loves it. It looks nice -- not cheap-looking. <end>  really really cute  This ring looks just like the picture. It's really cute on. It's sturdy so not much bending. Comfortable to wear. Nice! <end>

 B000EDRVO6  Garnet and Diamond Ring 14K White Gold ||	  This is my engagement ring, and I absolutely LOVE it.

I will treasure it forever. <end>
 B000EE4VPW  Red Coral Rose Cultured Pearl Tail Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Pendant Necklace ||	  Picture does not do this necklace justice!  My mother received this necklace yesterday for a birthday present and it is absolutely beautiful! There is a sparkle to it that doesn't show up in the pictures. The rose itself looks absolutely beautiful and not cheap. This is a fantastic gift. The chain is a good length and is very sturdy, not flimsy. The pearls are good quality. <end>  Coral/Pearl necklace  This coral/pearl necklace was the perfect gift for me to give for my daughter's 35th wedding anniversary. The pearls echoed the traditional 30th anniversary gift. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful  This necklace was a gift, and i had searched for the perfect necklace for a long time. When I came across this one, I knew it was perfect. The person who I gave it to, loved it to. For the price, it is a great deal and a beautiful necklace. I highly recommend it! <end>
 B000EG47X6  Sterling Silver Triple Open Marquis Drop Earrings ||	  One of my favorites  These earrings are so comfortable to wear. Quick and easy to put on. They have a nice movement and add a catchy sparkle to your ears. <end>
 B000EG6FXQ  Sterling Silver Open Lotus Drop Earrings ||	  So Beautiful!  These earrings are well crafted, artistic, and modern. I wanted them for months before I actually purchased them, and I am very happy I did. I love them. Earwire is sturdy and strong, very well made! <end>  Great design...........  .......however, they could have been better crafted. They are veeeeeeery pretty but really thin. I've bought equally pretty sterling silver earrings of BETTER quality for a third of this price. <end>  Poorly made  These are the farthest thing from being "well crafted." The picture is very deceiving, the front of them looks okay but when you turn them around they have this horrible ridge that makes them look like something you could by for $2 from some terrible store like claire's. If you can get past the fact that they look cheap, the design is actually nice. <end>  Beautiful earrings!  I absolutely love these earrings - they are a great alternative to the typical hoop earring. I received them about a month ago and I've been wearing them every day. I saw the review about the earwires but they are actually very solid - perhaps they improved them. <end>  poor  the lotus part of the earring was pretty, but the hook was very poor quality and probably would have broken the first time I wore it. I returned it. <end>
 B000EG6FYK  Sterling Silver Open Swirl Oval Drop Earrings ||	  Beautiful Quality!  The online photo didn't do these lovely earrings justice! Really pretty, nicely heavy silver. Packaged prettily, too. Very happy I got these for my niece for the holidays. <end>  Out fo stock? What a shame!  These are really great earrings- inexpensive and interesting without being too expensive. I wouldn't mind having a second pair. <end>  Very nice  I bought these for my wife and she loved them. They are very well made. <end>  Pretty and versatile  These are a little smaller than I thought they'd be, but they're pretty and go with lots of clothing styles. <end>  Earrings  I have received many of compliments for these pair of earrings. I have really enjoyed wearing them out in public. They never tarnish. You can wear them with just about anything or just by themselves. I am hoping a necklace will appear to me while I shop Amazon.com to match the earrings with. Very good choice and will recommend them to my friends. <end>  Nice  I would have to say that the earrings are not totally what I expected. I was looking to receive a larger pair. For the price, they are nice for teenagers. The quality was decent. <end>
 B000EG6G0S  Sterling Silver Multi-Strand Sea Life Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Really pretty, but...  The silver is too light for my taste. The color cheapened the beautiful design. I also bought some other silver jewelry from Amazon which had a darker tone to them. I wish this piece was just as dark. But for those who prefer bright silver, this is a really nice bracelet. <end>
 B000EG6G12  Sterling Silver Adjustable Heart Anklet, 9-10" ||	  review of ankle bracelet  The silver ankle bracelet I purchased through amazon.com was not only as described but also of very good quality as it has lasted several months with daily use. Thank you amazon.com. <end>  excellent product, would be hard to beat  I purchased this anklet for my wife, she loves it and wears it every day, great price and excellent weight. My wife says it is perfect. <end>
 B000EGANES  Sterling Silver Carnelian Charm Drop Necklace, 18" ||	  Looks nice, but not of very high quality  This is a nice necklace that goes with many of my tops. However, the quality is not good. I noticed several silver leaves on the necklace had already turned dark after a few wears. <end>
 B000EGN18I  Apex "Heart Patient" Bracelet ||	  A must for those who need it  I have given this to an older friend who has a pace-maker and she thought it was a great gift. I would definetly recommend this, it seems to be the perfect size for her. Would recommend. <end>
 B000EGP5DW  Apex Copper Bracelet, Solid Band ||	  Good value product. Perfect for our needs.  My husband and I periodically buy a small quantity of these bracelets and have them engraved with a motto for a local disabled veterans group. They have no magnets or other gimmicks. The veterans greatly appreciate the bracelet and the motivating phrase engraved on it.As with all copper bracelets there is some green residue on the skin for the first few weeks of wear. After that, the oxidation becomes set and there are no other problems.The copper bracelet is also easy to take off and put back on as necessary.Overall, a great item. <end>  Love copper!  I bought this because I love copper and wanted something inexpensive to wear with my casual wear. I am young and did not think about whether this would help my joints as some have bought similar products for the health benefits. Low and behold the times I did not wear this I felt a noticable difference about how I felt. I do suffer from joint pain in my fingers, wrists and feet but when I wear this bracelet it is not noticeable and I feel better. I can't explain it but it works for me. <end>  Not Disappointed  This bracelet is just as pretty as shown here. I am happy with this purchase. It has a very simple beauty that makes it so attractive. <end>  My Mother swears that this works!  My Mother was delighted to get this bracelet in her stocking for Christmas. She swears that it helps her arthritis! <end>  Durable, well made  I got this for my husband after his last copper bracelet finally broke in half. This one is durable and seems to be very well made. It's solid and attractive with no visible faults in construction - no rough spots either. The only reason he's giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a little light and he thought it would be slightly heavier. (though the lightness factor might make this a very nice option for a woman?) <end>  Nice copper bracelet!  Sturdy copper bracelet. If you're looking for a plain, durable, thick copper bracelet you've found it here. <end>  Dad (88 year old) is happy!  Bought this upon a request from my 88 year old Dad to find him one. He is very happy wiht it and it is on his wrist every day! <end>  Apex Copper Bracelet Review  I must say that this product did alleviate pain that I hand in my knuckles within a day. The copper did turn my skin green, but the stain easily washes off. I would recommend trying especially at the price. <end>  It works!  I wasn't expecting this to work...I broke my wrist over 10 years ago and was just starting to have problems with pain. After a few weeks of wearing the bracelet only in the daytime, my wrist feels a lot better. I can move it up and down and the swelling is gone completely. If this is only a placebo effect, that's fine! It works! <end>  It's a bracelet. Made of copper.  I bought this just as a copper bracelet. I couldn't care less, or believe less, in the "healing properties", and hence won't be reviewing them.I have tiny wrists, and even after overlapping the ends this bracelet is too large. When I adjusted it, the bracelet didn't bend uniformly (though I was fairly careful) and therefore is misshapen  hence the docking to 3 stars. The size (and resulting bending) wouldn't be a problem for larger-wristed folk, but they can write their own reviews. It's a perfectly fine copper band. Nothing fancy, a nice thickness, and a fine sheen (without being gaudily shiny). It also didn't discolor my wrists, which is nice. It seems a bit expensive for just a plain copper band, but all the other copper bands I looked at were more expensive. <end>  Been wanting one for years!  I have been looking for a solid copper thing to make a bracelet with for a few years now. I found this on Amazon for around $10 bucks. I was skeptical, but when I got it, very fast I must add, I was very pleased. Its nothing fancy, but also not ugly. I could not have wanted it any other way, exactly what I have been looking for. As far as for pain, I have no idea? I get pain medication from the VA that makes it kind of goofy to figure out what really hurts anymore, or where. I got it to go with my brass ring I wear on my neck. When I spearfish, the copper and brass make an electrical signal in the water that draws fish. Turns me into a human fishing lure. I hear it will draw in sharks too? If I survive, I will let you know how that went. Great product, exactly how its described on Amazon. Could not be more pleased. <end>  Okay for price  I got several of these and wished I had gotten the chunky heavy adn wide bracelets from billy the tree. They are heavier and better quality and the shipping was included in the price. <end>  It's okay  If you are looking for strictly functionality, this is a good buy. It's not at all a piece of jewelry. <end>  Made in the USA  Made in the USA was stamped into the inside of the bracelets that made it all worth it. Thank you <end>  A Good Purchase  A Good Purchase. Just what I wanted at good price. The service was good.. Would by another when I need one. <end>  My mum loves this  I bought this for my mum to help with her arthritis. She loves it and I am pleased with that <end>  Apex Copper Bracelet  Helps with arthritis. Adjusts to all wrist sizes. Worn 24 hours a day. The last one I had literally was worn so long, it became so thin I couldn't keep it on and eventually lost it. <end>  He loves it!  Got this for someone with arthritis and he loves it. He said that it works and his hands and fingers feel much better. <end>  Good solid band  This is a nice solid copper bracelet that works for me! If your careful, you can bend it to fit perfectly. <end>  Happy with it.  I can't honestly say if this copper bracelet has really alleviated any arthritis. I know it certainly has not made it worse, and maybe it has helped to relieve it, but in any case, it is attractive to wear and I like it. I only bought one of them and I will likely buy another one for my other wrist. It's very light so you don't know that you're wearing it. <end>  Pretty bracelet  It is a very pretty bracelet, but I did not notice any difference in my arthritis pain. I wore it for about a month, night and day. In the end, I took it off because it did not seem to make any difference for my arthritis. It was a disappointment, as I was really hoping it would work. <end>  copper bracelet  The quality of the bracelet is great, it looks nice, I didn't notice any improvements but what did bother me was the "green" stain on my wrist. <end>  Great Quality Bracelet  This bracelet is sturdy yet flexible. It has not tarnished yet and I have been wearing it consistantly for several days. I will order other copper items from Apex. <end>  Nice Copper Bracelet  It is a nice sturdy bracelet with no protective coating. This allows any benefits for joint pain to be absorbed from the bracelet through the skin. Does it work? Sometimes I think it helps, but I'm not sure. It's probably a lot like chicken soup -- it can't hurt. <end>
 B000EGPM44  Apex "Penicillin Allergy" Bracelet ||	  Too big  Tis is a great braclette for a man, but for me, I have small wrist, it is way too big, and its not adjustable at all. needless to say I haven't been able to wear it but Im going to look into getting it sized down, other wise Im gonna give it to my brother. <end>  Apex Penicillin Allergy Bracelet  CHEAP. Broke the second time my husband wore it. Would not buy it, very dissappointed with the purchase.Do not buy if you leave the house. <end>  Difficult to close  I ordred this product because I'm allergic to Penicilin and although it's comfortable to wear, it is a major headache to put it on, it has a sort of hook that was hard to figure out. Plus it's not very strong, I've accidentally snapped it a couple of times but was able to put it back together. <end>  Bracelet  I really enjoy this, however it is too big and making it smaller has become an issue but I really love having an allergy bracelet in case of an emergency. <end>
 B000EGQRB6  Sterling Silver Heart with Wings Pendant, 1/2 inch tall ||	  Adorable  The necklace is absolutely adorable. I work at a middle school and the kids constantly comment on how much they like the necklace. I love it a lot. It's very comfortable and easy to keep clean. <end>
 B000EGSF02  Sterling Silver Star with Yin and yang Pendant, 5/8 inch tall ||	  Okay  This was better than the earring. You still had to look hard to make out what it was suppose to be. <end>
 B000EGSFHU  Sterling Silver Saint Christopher Pendant for Gymnastics, 1 1/16 inch tall ||	  Great item  This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter, for her first year in gymnastics. It is a beautiful pendant and the chain was well made. She loves it and wears it all the time. <end>
 B000EGSFKC  Sterling Silver 2006 Graduation Hat ( Mortarboard ) Pendant, 3/4 inch ||	  Happy to know I can still get past years for a grad I know . . .  I disagree with 'Geek' who said the listing needs to be updated. I have several neices and cousins who graduated or are in the process of graduating from the years 2006 THROUGH 2010. In 2007 I started buying these great keychains that have a little silvertone diploma scroll hanging from them. On the front the scroll says, "Class of 2007" (or 2008, etc.) and is presented in a little black graduation-cap box with a tassel. However in 2006, when the first neice was graduating I never thought to buy something like the keychain. Anyway, I searched online SPECIFICALLY looking for 2006 graduation items and hit pay dirt. I'll present the neice who graduated in 2006 with her own 2006 keepsake when I give the 2008 grads their keepsakes. <end>  to whomever included this in the gift guide for grads...  um, it's well into 2007... late enough that college graduations have begun... perhaps you should update this listing... <end>
 B000EGUJHE  Sterling Silver Guitar Pendant, 1 1/4 inch ||	  just as expected  I really like the pendant. It was just as I had expected. Shipping was quick. Very satisfied. <end>
 B000EGWMXS  Sterling Silver Moon and Star Pendant, 3/4 inch tall ||	  Broken  i bought this necklace several months ago for myself...the day i got it in i noticed that only one part of the star was attached to the moon even though the picture shows two parts attached...i thought this might have been the way some of them were made..........well needless to say before the day was over the star had fallen off completely. i did not return the necklace simply because it looks fine with just the moon but i was still disappointed. i would not buy this necklace again if i could go back and do it over again. <end>  the jewelry is cheap, but the price is not  The pendant is stamped from thin silver (instead of being cast); it's very poor quality, but the price was almost twice as much as I usually pay online for high quality silver charms. <end>
 B000EGWNCS  Sterling Silver Christian Fish Pendant words JESUS, 1/2 inch ||	  Tiny  This is so tiny that it is difficult to read JESUS in the center. If you are looking for TINY, this is it, however if you want it to witness or to catch someones attention you may want to go bigger. <end>
 B000EHKGNA  Sterling Silver Block Initial Letter B Alphabet Pendant Highly Polished, 3/4 inch tall ||	  Love these!  I ordered a B and a V initial pendant. They are the first initials of my 2 kids. I love these! Not too small and not too big either. Perfect size to hang on your necklace! <end>
 B000EHW1OC  Sterling Silver Hamsa (Hand Of God) Pendant, 3/4 inch (17 mm) Long. ||	  absolutely beautiful  I bought this item for my boyfriend the first year we started dating- his grandparents are Jewish, and he celebrates some of the holidays with them even though he doesn't practice the religion, so I figured it would mean something to him and be utterly perfect in its symbolism.When it arrived in the mail, I was very happy with it- the chain was a bit thin (I felt the chain was more feminine than masculine with its delicate structure), but I felt that it was the perfect gift for him.And when the time came to give him the gift, he was pleasantly surprised and never took it off... my only regret is that he lost it a while later, most likely because the chain broke.The intricate details are what makes this piece so remarkable- I highly recommend it if you can think of someone to get it for. <end>  Beautiful expression of my heritage  This is a beautiful hamsa - I was afraid it would be too small but it is not - just a good size. Admittedly I am petite but the hamsa shows up nicely around my neck. It's the shape I remember seeing when I was growing up. I also love the Chai on it, so it's actually two symbols in one. It's not as deeply oxidized as pictured, which I think is a good thing. The only thing I wish were different is that the bale is tiny so it makes it difficult to switch the tiny, thin chain the hamsa came with. For that I subtracted a star. But the hamsa is beautiful and it is a beautiful expression of my Jewish heritage and religious feelings that I expect to enjoy. <end>  Hamsa/Hand of Fatima  Quick delivery and beautiful. Thank you. I would order from this seller agian. <end>  Very Nice Product, but may need slight modification  Ordered this necklace, as a gift, for my wife. She absolutely loves it. Item is very nicely sized. Not to big, not to small. The only issue I had was putting the necklace and the Hamsa together. The loop that the clasp connects to was slightly larger then the loop on the Hamsa. Therefor I had to smash the clasp loop, ever so slightly, to get it to fit through the Hamsa loop. Other the that slight issue the Hamsa and necklace are absolutely beautiful. I love how it looks on my wife's neck. I would highly recommend this item to anyone wanting a nicely sized Hamsa, that would look good on a woman's neck or a mans. The reason I am only giving 4 stars is due to my having to modify the necklace to fit the Hamsa loop. It may have only needed a millimeter of bending, but I feel it should have been sized as to avoid any modification. No matter how slight. The necklace once complete is awesome!!! A+++ to whomever designed the Hamsa <end>  Lovely hamsa  This is a beautiful piece of jewelry. Small, elegant and well-crafted. Initiallypurchased as a gift for my sister, in honor of a book she is writing using thissymbol, I liked it so much that I went back and ordered 3 more, for her husband, sonand daughter-in-law, so the whole family has matching pieces. The simple design andsmall size make it perfect for men or women. And the excellent price and good valuemade it possible to buy 4. May need heavier or longer chain for the men, the baleopening measures about 3/8 inch,so that should be o.k. <end>  Perfect size  Even prettier in person. design is lovely. I looked for a long time to find this hamsa-haven't taken it off since I got it. <end>  Hamsa Pendant  I recieved this product in a timely manner and in excellent shape and have enjoyed wearing it. I specifically like the sign of God in the middle of this pendant. <end>  Perfect Pendant!  I wanted to get a Hamsa necklace for my BF and it was really tough to find one that was more on the manly side. I saw that someone else had written a review for this necklace; that it was a gift for her BF and he loved it. That was the confirmation I needed!I ordered the necklace and when I received it I was more impressed than I thought I would be! The chain was perfect (kinda like a box chain) and the detail looked great! My BF loved it and he wears it everyday! <end>  fantastic quality  I loved this item i bought it for a friend and they were thrilled about it since they had never seen anything like this it has a real lovely chain and the engraving is fantastic! <end>  Exactly what i was looking for.  I spent a lot of time trying to find the perfect Hamsa necklace. I wanted one that wasn't too big or too small, with a simple design. This one is seriously perfect. Not too loud, but shows itself nicely around the neck. Shipping was also extremely fast. <end>  Nice  This is a very pretty necklace. Received as a gift, and I love it. <end>
 B000EHXXA8  Sterling Silver Manatee Pendant, 1 inch (24 mm) Long. ||	  Very nice Manatee  The manatee is great quality and was really liked by my husband on his birthday. Nice qauality and something I would buy again from this dealer. It was a bit smaller than I originally thought but still worth getting. <end>  Very very nice  I was looking for a necklace for my wife. She love's Manatee's and this was perfect. She's had it on for three weeks now and won't take it off. That sounds like a great review right there. <end>
 B000EHY2Q2  Sterling Silver Baseball Catcher Pendant, 1 1/2 inch (37 mm) tall ||	  FANTASTIC!  I am so pleased with this pendant! It arrived quickly, the quality and size are AMAZING!!!

 B000EHY47Y  Sterling Silver Arrow Pendant, 1 inch tall ||	  Delicate, but adorable and exactly what I wanted  I have always been a fan of archery and have long since tried to get into it as a hobby. Now that I am graduated from college and working full time, I have the money and time on weekends to pursue it! I really wanted a cute but simple arrow pendant that was fancy enough to wear on a nice night out, but sturdy enough to wear to work as a Vet Tech to display my passion for the sport of archery. This necklace is definitely very pretty, much more so in person, though it seems a little more delicate than the pictures makes it out to be. The picture, to me, makes it seem more like it is made of pewter, and a little more solid, when in actuality it is far more delicate. I'm sure if I applied enough pressure I could easily bend the arrow. However, it still seems well crafted and I have already worn it several times. I will probably not be wearing it to work since it is lighter and more delicate than I had anticipated, but it is still accurately portrayed in the seller's details. It came wrapped in a silver box and both the pedant and charm were each packed in their own little zip lock bag. I am very happy with the quality and look of the pendant and would buy it again over some of the other, less attractive bow and arrow pendants on Amazon, I just won't be wearing it to work where I wrestle with dogs and cats on a daily basis  ) <end>
 B000EHY4LU  Sterling Silver Cross Pendant, Made in Italy. 1 5/16 inch (34 mm) Tall ||	  DO NOT BUY!!  In the picture it looks real nice but when it arrives it looks and feels just like a plastic necklace you would get out of a 25 cent machine. Its "high polish" is scratched up and the way it's made it comes with a fairly large hole in the top and bottom of the cross. It is a piece of junk and not worth the money. Oh and by the way they won't pick up the shipping cost for me to return it so I just lost $10 on this crappy necklace. <end>
 B000EI0260  Sterling Silver Crescent Moon and Star Pendant, 2 3/16 inch (56 mm) tall ||	  I bought this item to my sister .  I bought this item to my sister as agift,its look very nice and good size.it is in good condtion,she liked it. <end>
 B000EI02WE  Sterling Silver Allah Pendant, 1 inch (25 mm) tall ||	  Allah pendant  Great product! Price was very reasonable and product came within a few days. I bought this for my daughters' for Eid, and they both loved it and now wear it everyday. <end>  Love it!  I am very pleased with this pendant. It's large enough to be noticed and admired. It's also of good quality. I would recommend this for any woman looking to wear Islamic jewelry. <end>
 B000EI08HI  Sterling Silver Small Yin and yang Pendant, Made in Italy. 1/2 inch (13 mm) in Diameter. ||	  Krido  I think this is awesome but just like the other pendant I got you gotta be careful because the part that holds it to the chain is not solded together so you can easily jank it off while taking a sweater off and not realize it, thats how i lost my other pendant. <end>  Awesome  )  this was a gift for my daughter who loves yin-yang, especially it's made in &#34;italy&#34; can't go wrong.... if my daughter loves it, then I love it as well, thank you seller.... <end>
 B000EI1WDW  Sterling Silver Sweet 16 Pendant, 7/8 inch (22 mm) Long. ||	  Pretty Sweet 16  This was a beatiful necklace, true to the picture. My daughter has wore it everyday since she received it. Wonderful to do business with! <end>
 B000EI22Z4  Sterling Silver Saint Jude Medal, Made in Italy. 5/8 inch (17 mm) in Diameter. ||	  MEDAL IS HOLLOW!!!  BE CAREFUL!!!!! This medal is hollow and SOUNDS hollow when it moves around on a necklace. I had no idea it was going to be hollow and almose puffy looking. Because it's a good looking medal, I still gave it as the gift I intended it to be, but I was a little embarrased. I will probably replace with another, medal that doesn't "sound" so cheap when worn... <end>  broke when i got it  When I recieved this item it had split apart and was broken. I was so mad I just threw it away!!! <end>  Ok for the money  The pendant is much shinier than the picture. I was under the impression that it looked a little worn, which I wanted. There is also something in the back which isn't mentioned on here. All in all it's ok, I was just hoping for something more "metal like" and this seems almost plastic. I still wear it so I guess I shouldn't gripe too much. It did arrive very quickly, which I appreciate. You get what you pay for... if I'd spent more money on it I would be pissed, I'll put it that way. <end>  Petite, very nice  My wife lost the St Jude Medal she has worn for years on an ankle bracelet. I was looking for one that was silver and small and this one is perfect. She loves it. <end>

 B000EI2JCA  Sterling Silver Cross with Dove Pendant, 2 5/16 inch (59 mm) tall ||	  magnificent cross review  The cross is perfect for what it is. It arrived much larger than I expected. I would highly rrecommend this cross just use a ruler to flesh out the dimensions given in the add. <end>
 B000EI2JP2  Sterling Silver Allah Pendant, 1 inch (25 mm) tall ||	  Beautiful and durable  I've now had this item for years, and it looks just as good as it did the first day I received it.

The quality was very good and it's just beautiful. The shipping was fast and it was packaged very well. Thank you!! <end>
 B000EI2MXQ  Sterling Silver Small Royal Flush Card Pendant, 1 inch (24 mm) tall ||	  Disappointment  I was very disappointed to find that this is a stamped silver item. I had expected it to be solid, not look as if it were a cutout on the reverse side. Had realized that I would not have bought it. <end>
 B000EI2N0I  Sterling Silver Small Bulldog Pendant, 1 3/16 inch (30 mm) tall ||	  Nice  The bulldog detail was nice but was alittle big for my taste. The part were the chain goes through is huge!!! did not look right with a silver chain unles you like some thing really large but I did find a black cord rope chain which i thought looked great. <end>
 B000EI2PHY  Sterling Silver Small Elephant Pendant, Made in Italy. 1/2 inch (13 mm) Tall ||	  Cheaply Made  The charm looks nice, but it is hollow and very light weight. The skin is extremely thin silver. I suspect that the flimsy charm will dent easily, making it very unattractive.In general, the item looks and feels cheaply made. Do not expect it to be any more than a novelty piece. <end>
 B000EI5IA0  Diamond Accent Heart Pendant in 10K White Gold ||	  Eh, it's ok.  It's a beautiful pendant, but it's incredibly small. The whole thing, including the top loop, would fit inside a dime. It's beautiful, so I may have still purchased knowing this, but its size wasn't disclosed anywhere and I was just a little surprised. <end>  lecklace  i am pleased with this product even though it was smaller than expected it is very nice regaurdless of size and the shipping was speedy and excellent packaging i would recommend this product <end>
 B000EI7IXU  Aquamarine and Diamond Fashion Pendant in 14K White Gold ||	  Great addition to my collection!

It's well crafted and worth every penny! Thanx! Sorry I did not review sooner. Oh, I say perfect for male also, b/c it's a pretty good size and won't look "dainty" on a guy. great product! <end>
 B000EIGJJO  Sterling Silver Maple Leaf Pendant, 3/4 inch Tall ||	  So pretty  I wear this pendant almost every day and get compliments on it all the time. I bought a thin 16" black leather necklace to wear with it and it looks great. <end>  High quality - prettier than the picture  A very pretty and highly-detailed leaf. NOT FLIMSY. Fairly large charm, with very good detail. The back is polished shiny and looks nice, the front is very detailed with a bit of diamond-cutting for flash.Unisex. I bought two, one for my husband. It's not really girly looking, it's a maple leaf. Had special significance for my hubby and me.I particularly like that the leaf is upright. Most of the leaf pendants I looked at were stem side up. This one is stem-down, and resembles a little tree. I prefer that.It comes with a very dainty little silver chain, so you are actually buying a necklace, but if you don't have a very slender neck the chain might not look right for you. We already had heavier chain necklaces to wear with it.In the picture there are black spots. Horrible picture. I promise you there were no black spots on ours! <end>  Loved this sterling silver leaf necklace!  I was so pleased to receive the maple leaf necklace in sterling today! I can't believe my luck getting such a nice looking piece. My daughter will be thrilled as her Christmas list said, "small Leaf necklace in sterling silver" and that is exactly what was delivered! The detail on the leaf is extrordinary--even the 'back' is pretty! It's sparkling beautifully as it's hung on my tree waiting for her to discover it when she gets home from college. The chain is also good quality and will not need to be replaced.I can't thank you enough for creating such a pretty piece especially for the price--more than reasonable! <end>  Silver leaf charm  Very happy with this purchase!!! Awesome quality silver fall leaf charm perfect for the woman who dresses with the season. <end>

 B000EIIC44  Sterling Silver Cross Pendant, 1 1/4 inch ||	  Lovely cross  I am happily surprised that this sterling silver cross is of such high quality. The price was so low I figured I was taking a risk but it really is a beautiful piece. Worth more than I paid. <end>
 B000EJ6FSS  72 Inches 8.0mm-8.5mm Freshwater Black Pearls. Cultured Freshwater Black Pearl Necklace ||	  Beautiful Pearls  I received these pearls in three days.They were very well packaged.The picture does not do the pearls justiceThey are better than pictured luster is good quality good.The pearls are black. the other smaller pictures arelike what you receive. The size of the pearls are nice as pictured.Uniformity and color are very good.All pearls inthis price catagory have blemishes they are not noticable and don't detract from their appearanceI am not crazy about the knotting. I think that could definitly be improved upon.However if you are carefull with your pearls keep them in the pouch they came in. I don't advise wearing pearlseveryday.Keep them away from hairspray and perfume.Your pearls will serve you for years.Look up on the internetfor how to care for pearls,Care is very important because pearls can actually change shape from misuseThese are very good pearls for the price. you will be happy with theseJewelry days gave prompt service.I almost forgot I love the darker pearls I own a string of chocolate natural pearlsI did buy these through Amazon <end>  Understated elegance.  These were the first black pearls I ever bought and am thrilled with them. So very special, lovely to hold, individually knotted and lie beautifully around your neck no matter what length you choose. They add that touch of class to anything you will wear day or evening. The pearls were decent quality, some imperfections, but nothing ugly, and sized as stated. A great treat for yourself or a wonderful gift for somebody special. <end>  georgeous  this is a beautiful set of pearls. My hubby bought these for me for Christmas...they go with so many different things, I find myself wearing them several times a week. You can wear them single, double, triple, and even quadruple (but that gets to be too thick around the neck). Great set - and great value! <end>
 B000EJCX98  Sterling Silver Arabian Horse Pendant, 1/2 inch Tall ||	  good pendant  this is a pretty pendant, but the picture is misleading, I was expecting a full-3d pendant, but it is only pretty from the front, the backside is hollow silver <end>  Silver Horse Necklace  My five year old daughter LOVES this necklace; however, it is very adaptable for any girl! It is well made and is a great buy for the money! What a great keep sake for someone that loves horses! <end>  Wonderful Gift!  Our granddaughter loves her horse necklace! She wears it all the time and is so proud of it!

It was a gift from my husband and it is ABSOULTELY GORGEOUS and high quality! I love it! It is commented on and admired by all who see me wearing it.

I couldn't be more pleased and want to know what other bunny delights Sabrina Silver has fashioned. <end>
 B000EJGEDE  Sterling Silver Brooklyn Bridge Pendant, 1 inch Wide ||	  Silver charm  This silver charm of the Brooklyn Bridge is a disappointment. It is very lightweight silver and does not have the substance of a good silver charm. The definition of the bridge is not as good as it should be. Order was sent out very quickly. <end>

 B000EJGFUQ  Sterling Silver Small Violin Pendant, 3/4 inch Tall ||	  Not so good  It looks cuter in the picture than in real life. You can't quite tell what it is and it doesn't look like a violin other than the shape. It might be OK for a small child, but I won't wear it. To be fair, the seller I got this from has dozens of other items that are fantastic, just not this one! <end>
 B000EJI694  Sterling Silver Chinese Zodiac Pendant, for Year of the RAT, 1/2 inch tall ||	  Just OK  I purchased a rat Chinese Zodiac pendant. The pendant is smaller than expected and does not have clearly defined features of a rat. <end>
 B000EJI6KS  Sterling Silver Key Pendant, 1 1/16 inch Tall ||	  Beautiful keys at an affordable price.  I purchased the key pendants to present to a Girl Scout troop as they bridged to Cadette Girl Scouts. The keys are so pretty with a lot of detail the girls love them (12 year olds). I see them at school and around town wearing them. They are beautiful and the price was very affordable. They are so nice I purchase two more the following month; one for each Leader. <end>  Cute necklace and great service!  I've been looking for a key pendant for a long time, and this is exactly what I've been looking for! The pendant is a little smaller than what the picture may suggest, but the size is good. The seller was very fast in shipping, and the quality is really good. I've been wearing my necklace every day since. You won't be disappointed. <end>  Uniquely Beautiful  I purchased this pendant as a gift for my college-age daughter who likes her jewelry to be a bit unique and not overly ornate. The key has a bit of a Victorian flavor and a nice, solid weight -- my daughter loved it the moment she saw it. Very nice quality for a very reasonable price. <end>  nice item  It is pretty much what it looks like. Key is a tad smaller than it looks in the pictures but it is nice none the less. I attached it to a key chain for my girlfriend and gave it to her. She enjoyed it. Necklace is rather nice too. <end>  Nice item. Fast shipping. Great seller  Exactly as its described. Very nice item. Seller ships fast and no problems at all. <end>  a truly well made, and pretty peice of jewelry to own, affordable price, and comes with its own chain as well.....  i have always been fascinated by keys, especially skeleton keys, and have always wanted one as a pendant.... out of several different ones i looked at on here, i finally decided on this one... i liked how it came with its own chain... its a bit smaller than pictured, but still really pretty, and well made... again, as most of my jewelry reviews go, it can go with anything.... highly recomended, and a quality peice of jewelry to own indeed... affordable price as well...... <end>  Cute pendant  The quality of this necklace is really good. The key pendant is exactly what I have been looking for. <end>  Great!  Just what I was looking for! Very nice! I ordered it as a Confirmation gift for my niece because it symbolized her chosen Bible verse. She made the connection immediately and was so surprised . . . absolutely loved it! <end>  Beautiful  Absolutely beautiful key and a fine chain. Fancy, but not too fancy. Old-fashioned and classy design. It's a key on both sides and not flat on one side as some are.The keys were mailed really fast and came in a nice silver-colored box with each key in a small plastic bag and nice padding beneath.Would definitely buy from this seller again. Can't wait to make gifts of the keys and chains. <end>  Sterling Silver Key pendents  I bought three of these for three very dear friends for Christmas. They are just the right size. I bought an 20" chain for each of them and it worked and looked great. <end>  very good quality  The good thing about this is that it looks EXACTLY like the picture. I do mean exactly. Even the size is the same as the pic give or take a few mm. I would have loved for the key to be bigger but it's not amazons fault that I didn't know how much 1 1/6 in really was. overall it is great and i've had it for a couple of months now and it still looks brand new. <end>  Just the right size  Not tiny, not huge. I put it on a chain with a tiny heart...cute! <end>  nice and simple  This pendant is good quality, but smaller than the picture. It is a simple piece of jewelry, which is my style, and it came in a little box with a short chain. I would buy it again if I needed to. <end>  Smaller than expected.  It was a lot smaller than i thought it would be. It's a little bit bigger than a quarter. But it's good and sturdy, very good quality. I love my little key  ) <end>  Great Necklace!  I was very excited to receive this as a gift in my Christmas stocking today. This is a great necklace at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend it to everyone! <end>

 B000EKDHRE  Blue FLEXI WHISTLE Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Fun Novelty Item  This whistle actually works but its kind of tricky to get a loud sound out of it. I thought the whistle itself might be flexible due to the product description and its not. But it wasn't uncomfortable to wear, but only had it in for a few hours. I loved all the laughs I got from it. <end>  Nice little waste of money  The whistle end of the barbell is just superglued in there, it just popped out after the 3rd time trying to whistle with it. If you want to spend a dollar per use, buy this, but i doubt you'll even be able to screw the bottom on without the whistle coming off instead <end>
 B000EKFD9E  Green FLEXI WHISTLE Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  NOT GOOD (  THIS IS NOT A GOOD RING I DIDN"T LIKE IT ITS HARD TOO USE ..

I would definitely order from here again. It fits comfortably and works as intended. Thank you so much. <end>

 B000ELQSW4  .62ctw Round Diamond Platinum Band (SI1/2, H-I), Size 5 ||	  Beautiful ring  This was a beautiful ring that stands out. One issue I had was the thickness where the diamons are. On its own it is really beautifull, my wife loved it. However when worn with the engagement ring on the same finger, both didn't seem to go together as it was hindering the diamond from the enagagement ring. A great buy and price's worth for around $600 <end>
 B000ELUR80  Oval Rolo 7.5" Heart Tag Charm Silver Tone Bracelet ||	  bracelet  The heart on the bracelet came off after the second day of wear. I do not recommend the product, but the delivery and service were done well. <end>  Cute and very shiny  The bracelet is a very bright and shiny, quite nice.

 B000EMOXD4  Silver Forest Sea Turtle Earrings ||	  Picture doesn't do the errings justice  My girlfriend loves the errings, they are made of polished surgical steel and copper. They look fantastic and the inprinting used to make the turtle is deep enough to see what the shape is. She loves them! <end>  happy  Cute silver forest sea turtle earrings, great real colors, well made. Fast shipping. I gave them as a gift.

They are much nicer than expected. The size and color is perfect and they are made with surgical steel if you have any metal allergies. <end>
 B000EN0VIE  Amazon.com  Travel Jewelry Case  Clothing ||	  Not very useful...  I bought this for taking the "good jewelry" with me when I travel, but it really lacks usable features. I found it too small to be practical.The ring bar is so skinny that your rings end up rubbing together. It does have a couple of small pockets in which you could put rings or small earrings, and two medium-sized zipper pockets that might hold a bracelet or small watch.If you really want to take your good stuff with you, look elsewhere. If you just want to bring a spare ring and a pair of earrings for a weekend, this would be okay. <end>  Perfect size for travel.  Baggallini makes terrific products, and this is one of them. I don't carry much jewelry with me when I travel, so I love the compactness of this case. I obviously disagree with the opinion of the other reviewer. My advice is to give this organizer a chance. <end>

 B000EOL9R0  USA Eagle Cutout - Other Lapel Pins ||	  Color Blind?????  I ordered 4 US Eagle pins in early November. Today I received 4 eagle pins from another country. Why do I said another country, well being a 30 yr retired Army Master Sergeant my flag has always been Red, White, BLUE. The eagles I received are Red, White, GREEN. According to the package they were made in China. Flagline.com has an address of Colorado Springs, CO. Maybe they should pay a visit the local university in their town. The school isThe United States Air Force Academy. I know for a fact none of their flags are Red, White, GREEN. Since I try to support companies in this country, I think they should support our work force and buy from manufacturer in the US. There must be an outbreak of color blindness by worker in China. These eagle don't soar like our national symbol does, they don't even fly with turkeys, they just sail off into color blindness world.USA Eagle Cutout - Other Lapel Pins <end>  Great Quality  This was my first 'Pin' order and I was pleasantly suprised.High Quality, people loved it. I ordered 100, I should have orderd 1,000, they went that fast!Great customer support also. <end>  Great Gift  Bought these as gifts for a trip to Austria, and they went QUICK! everyone loved them. <end>

 B000EOOIKK  Sterling Silver 2.0 Carat Size Princess Cut Amethyst Colored CZ Men's Solitaire Ring (Available in Sizes 8 to 13) ||	  Stunning Gentlemans Ring  When I lost my 10k gold and yellow Topaz birthstone ring in the warm gulf waters, I was sickened. While searching Amazon I noticed this ring with a stone not a Topaz birthstone but it was a CZ Amethyst, my favorite color, set in sterling silver, I just could not resist it. This ring is gorgeous, and after only wearing it for 1 week, I have already enjoyed several compliments. I love this ring, I don't like the gulf for taking my old ring, but it's been replaced now. My only complaint is that it doesn't arrive in a ring box, but arrives in a small silver cardboard box. I keep it stored in my old ring box from my lost birthstone ring and when I'm not wearing it, which is hardly ever, I open the box and it is STUNNING to say the least! <end>  Excellent  This ring was purchase for my son's 16th birthday and when it arrived I was amazed at the craftsmanship. It is beautiful but just right for a young man. The price was great and shipping was quick! I will buy again from them. My son loves it and wears it everyday!! <end>  Sizing was right on!  Excellent quality sterling silver, and though I was worried, sizing was right on! This was important to me because I was trying to decide between this sterling silver ring and a tungsten ring, and apparently some tungsten rings on Amazon run a half size larger than normal. My boyfriend was very pleased. My only complaint is I wished it had come in a 'felt' ring box, but that wasn't too big of a deal considering it's on my boyfriend's finger anyway. <end>  Birthday  This was a birthday presnet for me from my Sister and Brother in law. I wear it everyday and love the ring. It replaes a piece of costune jewelry I broke a year ago. Wonderful piece of jewelry, I adore it. <end>  Awesome!  This is the third Silver ring I have purchased from Sabrina.I am blown away with the quality.The pictures here on Amazon really do no justice at all to the beauty and quality of this ring.The two other rings I purchased from Sabrina are exceptional as well.WELL! worth the price. <end>  Wonderful ring.  This ring was bought for a man that has graced many book covers. He was very pleased with it. <end>
 B000EOOJ2C  Sterling Silver 1 1/2 Carat Size Pear Cut Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Bridal Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  Beautiful  This ring is just gorgeous. The band is slender and the stone is well-faceted, so it sparkles. It does not look like cubic zirconia in any light, but rather like a good quality diamond. All in all, I am very pleased with Sabrina Silver's quality and fast service. I will buy from them again and recommend them to others. <end>  Just ordered my second one.  I ordered this ring several months ago and have had many envious comments on it. The band is feminine in that it is not chunky, but slim line and the 1-1/2 carat is big, but not too big to look cheap. I lost weight so I just ordered it in a smaller size. The first one has held up really well and the cz diamond still sparkles when I take the time to clean it. <end>  Pretty ring but...  It is a very pretty ring, but sadly, no, it will not pass as a diamond. No one will be fooled by this stone. The stone is dull and has no light, no life to it. But then again, it is a ring under $20.00, so what can we expect? <end>
 B000EOOJ36  Sterling Silver .75 Carat size Heart Cut Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Bridal Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  Decent ring, would be 5 stars if cheaper  The seller's photo of this ring is pretty bad. The ring actually looks better than that, but it still won't blow anybody away. The metal, while shinier than the stainless steel look in the photo, is still not that great, and the stone is ok looking and has a cute shape but even for CZ it doesn't seem to have that sparkly gleam. It's not a bad ring, but considering that you can get rings of similar quality for $10-$20, I can't give this 5 stars. <end>
 B000EOOJ6I  Sterling Silver .30 Carat Size Princess Cut Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Bridal Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  nice small ring  very nice small sized ring I can stack it with other rings for different looks <end>
 B000EOQD1M  Platinum, Round, Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/3 cttw, G-H Color, VS2 Clarity) ||	  Very nice  I bought these for the woman in my life. First time I've bought jewelry online, let alone diamonds--I was a little nervous. They're excellent quality, though. Let's do the 4Cs. Definitely "eye-clear," there are certainly no inclusions that I can see (VS2); they appear colorless to me; the cut is good. I don't believe amazon specifies it, which is a shame (although who really cares if it's not certified anyway), but in my diamond-dilettante opinion, the cut is simply "Good", and nothing more. Don't get me wrong, they're very sparkly, but they're not incandescent. When we woke up this morning it was still almost dark, and I could see she was wearing the earrings.1/3 carat is the PERFECT size. Perfect. Any bigger and they'd look fake (and gaudy, ostentatious)... could probably have gone for 1/4 carat, but these are ideal. If you're worried about getting specks, I wouldn't go below 1/4 (personally).The setting is very elegant. Platinum! The box they came in is quite nice--very presentable.I'm overall overwhelming pleased. Diamond studs appear to be on near-constant sale on Amazon; I got 40% off which took them to $507.98 (this on 12/8/08). She likes them, she's happy, I'm happy  -) <end>  Pleased  This was my first diamond purchase. I got them for my sister. She was very happy to receive these. The diamonds are about 4mm in diameter. They are shiny. I did not notice any obvious clarity or color issues. Amazon has 40%, 50% and even 60% off deals on these very often. I'd never pay the list price. I paid $400 during one of the frequently regular jewelry deals here. Couldn't be happier. Hope this helps. <end>  Value for the money  The diamond stud earrings were what I expected and well worth the money. They are well crafted and brilliant in the light. Equally important, the shipment to Thailand arrived without a hitch. My wife wears them all the time, even when she' sleeping or wearing other earrings. That's the final word on "approval." <end>  Fantastic earrings  These earrings are great, as a previous reviewer said, these 1/3 carat earrings are a great size. Anything bigger and you risk looking really over the top. The cut and clarity are really nice too and the sparkle very nice in the sun. My wife got these as an anniversary gift and she was very happy with them. They have a standard locking post type lock, but seems to be extra firm in the grab so they should stay put. I would buy these again. <end>  Very clear, nice set.  Bought these for the wife for Christmas. They sparkle very brightly, seem quite clear, really nice set.the 1/3 is a tad large for a woman's second earing hole (if they have 2-3 holes up their ear and I believe that 1/2 would work just fine in the lowest hole, however the 1/3 works well there as well. If these are a second pair, I would go 1/4 if your going up the ear, but 1/3-1/2 carat seems perfect for the lowest ear hole.I'm a guy what do I know?! <end>  Amazing Diamond Earrings  Besides an engagement ring, I have never bought any jewelry for my fianc&eacute;e. After searching around what is available in the Philadelphia area, these earrings were the best deal. All said and done they were anywhere between 10 and 40% cheaper on here than anywhere else. They came in a very nice box and my fianc&eacute;e absolutely loves them. The 1/3 caret is perfect for her ears. This was a great deal and I recommend it. <end>  Excellent...  This is my first time to buy jewelery online, and it turns out pretty well, will shop again... <end>
 B000EOQMQS  Sterling Silver 2.0 Carat Size Princess Cut Blue Topaz Colored CZ w/ Mother of Pearl Solitaire Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  eye catching!  beautiful ring....with blue topaz, make it even prettier.really a nice ring, thanks seller/Amazon.com <end>
 B000EOX1Z8  Platinum, Round, Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/4 cttw, G-H Color, VS2 Clarity) ||	  Beautiful Earrings  [...] They are beautiful, very sparkly and brillant. They are the perfect size for someone who wears multiple earrings or just likes a small bit of flash. I am pleased, happy and very glad that Amazon has so many tempting gold box offers. I have some bigger earrings that I bought from another popular diamond website, but those are not as sparkly and pretty. <end>  tooo small  These are very very small. Don't get taken in by amazon's inflated MSRP, These are not worth more than 400$. wife returned them without even trying. <end>
 B000ES009Y  Sterling Silver High Polished Movable Beaded Girl Pendant ||	  Girl pendant  I searched everywhere for this pendant! I already had 3 representing my children but I needed one more girl pendant but couldn't find. My others came from Venezuela & Canada & I was about to give up the search then I spent a few hours over a period of months searching Amazon & low & behold there she was! I couldn't believe it! I am pleased as punch to have her! <end>
 B000ES179Q  1" (25mm) Sterling Silver Diamond-shaped Tube Italian Hoop Earrings, Quarter Size ||	  Nice earrings, great price!  I love these earrings. When I bought them, I thought they would probably be cheaply made. To my surprise, they are very nice! I especially like the size (about the size of a US quarter coin). In addition, the seller shipped them super fast. Buy them, you won't be sorry! <end>  Fabulous Buy!  What a great pair of earrings! I can't tell you how often I wear these. They are the perfect size for everything. Thanks again for a terrific purchase. <end>
 B000ES17FK  Sterling Silver High Polished Movable Chicken Egg Pendant ||	  Great Quality and Fun, too!  This egg/chick pendant is so well made, of good weight and fun to wear. I'm a new real chicken owner, so I thought this would reinforce my commitment to my girls! <end>
 B000ES17G4  Sterling Silver High Polished Movable Tin Man Pendant ||	  Great Service  Very prompt services. Pendant is dainty, very sweet... it was a pleasure to give it as a gift. The chain was rather thin and I would have rather liked the option to upgrade it when I placed my order instead of having to buy a separate chain all together. <end>  Great gift for person who has no heart.  I gave this to a person that is high on self-centeredness and low on having a heart, and it got the message across. <end>
 B000ES323K  Sterling Silver Italian 3mm Tube Egg-Shaped Italian Oval Hoop Earrings ||	  Great Buy!  I love these earrings and wear them all the time. They're a great buy for the price! <end>  Love these hoops!  Great quality, comfortable wire and just a little different than the usual round hoops. Wear 'em all the time! <end>  Really pretty, I wear them often!  These arrived faster than I expected. They are a nice shape and thickness, and were not uncomfortably heavy, something I worry about when buying earrings online.The closure has a nice, solid 'click', and I'm always sure they're secure. <end>  Silver Hoop Earrings  Good quality, good size earrings. Have worn them alot since receiving them and the price was fair. <end>  Jewelry  I was very pleased with these ear rings. They were a Christmas gift, and the recipient really liked them. Being oval hoops, rather than round, she didn't have any like them. <end>  Different Shape -- cool  So, I wasn't sure quite what to expect with these when I ordered them. But they are nice. A thicker hoop - the metal is thick (the cylinder metal of the hoop). But the oval shape is different and looks good for work - not too big looking cause of the oval, but then transitions well to evening or day fun or whatever. <end>  Sterling Silver Earrings  I love these earrings. They look good and the stem is nice and long and they are easy to put on. <end>  italian hoop earrings  the earrings was just the right size i was looking for.i would purchase more to give as birthday gifts. <end>
 B000ES4WWK  Sterling Silver High Polished Movable Elephant Pendant ||	  Very unique!  I bought this for a friend for Christmas. She loves elephants and sterling silver. She wears it all the time and gets a lot of comments on how cute it is. It's also really neat because you can move the arms and legs. My kids find it fun to play with when she holds them. It's not overly big where it looks bad. I would recommend this if you like elephants or unique gifts. It's certainly one of a kind.  o) <end>
 B000ESCMWM  Sterling Silver Rope Chain Anklet 10 inch Ankle Bracelet with Lobster Clasp ||	  Exactly what I expected  Lost an anklet that was an exact replica of this one; shipping was a little lengthy, but this product was just perfect and identical to the one I lost. <end>  delicate beauty  I love this anklet cos of the clasp, price and the design. It definately draws attention to your legs i can assure you that. However, 'm afraid to wear it into the shower fearing it might break or get discolored.This shows how much i love my anklet. I definately recommends this. <end>  Seems like a quality item  This bracelet is stamped as Italian 925 silver...seems quite sturdy and I'm happy with the purchase. <end>  not exactly sterling  Although I have enjoyed the anklet, the color is now "gold-tone" rather than silver. I received the anklet as a gift last Christmas (a year). It would not seem to be actual sterling. I don't really enjoy it as much as I once did. I am disappointed in the lasting quality. <end>  nice  It came quick. Looks good. Wife likes it. As of right now, worth what I paid for it. If she ain't complaining, I'm not either. Lol. <end>  Goes with most outfit  This is a beautiful ankle bracelet. The colors are lovely and go with most every outfit. The ankle bracelet is comfortable and can be sized. It is a great piece of jewelry for any age. The item arrived on time and was wonderfully packaged. A terrific item and it comes from a consistently great seller. <end>  Nice for the price  I have big girl legs and need something a little longer to be comfortable and this was perfect. It's nicer then the picture..very light and shiny. <end>  Sterling silver beauty  This bracelet is so pretty, delicate, yet sturdy, well made, yet comfortable. It was so reasonably priced I was not sure what to expect, but it is very pretty, and the entire process was positive. I will definetly be a repeat customer and recommend them to my friends. <end>  Great price!  This anklet was a great price, less than 1/2 of what it would have cost me in town. wears nice, looks nice. <end>  I dont remember buying this...  Idk why i bought this or if i did buy it.....I cannot access the memory of having this is doing anything with it.... -.-.... ummmm yeah.. so idk what to say about it... its a chain.......... what can really go wrong with it... <end>  Better than expected!  When the anklet arrived it was better than I expected. Even though the chain looks delicate once placed on my ankle, it really stands out and draws one's eye right to it. Also, I've had it for a month and have never broken it, which is amazing since I never take it off. I even wear it in the shower, and it still keeps it's shine. It was a great buy! <end>  looks delicate but its beauty is also strength  I wanted an anklet that would hold up to daily wear comfortably and still look beautiful. this has done all so far. the construction is good and has a solid clasp without being overbearing in size. shipped quickly. can recommend. <end>  Great Service  My girlfriends birthday was coming up & she always spoke of getting an anklet. So, I ordered from this seller on Amazon. I received the item a week before her birthday & more importantly it was exactly what I ordered. The length was perfect, absolutely perfect. I will be ordering from them again. This seller definitely gets my vote for 10 stars. <end>  Awesome deal  Bought one of these for my sister in law and my mom liked it so much I had to buy her one also. It`s a great deal and well worth the money! <end>  Good Gift for wife or Girl Friend.  I picked this up for my wife and she seemed to like it a lot but it fit kind of tight on her even though normal 9 inch anklets fit great. Overall a decent product though. <end>  Why would a guy..  Why would a guy buy an anklet? Reasonable question. But, I find it no more an unreasonable an issue than guys having tatoos; which, but for patient treatment and expense, they can't remove. And this purchaser is not a jewelry type, nor a metro-sexual.But this item is suggestive of something firm, not dainty. It even feels substantial; clasp seems strong and it hangs just below the ankle (though higher than I expect the sag would eventually be witnessed by a tatoo).It's my thing, my rationale, and I'm quite satisfied with it for substance and evident strength. Unless I'm at the gym or a beach, or going sockless; I'm it's only witness. As for remarks? What's an echo, but a sound not heeded. <end>  cute ankel bracelet  Plain classic silver bracelet. I wear it 24-7 so it is durable. I wear it in the pool, in the shower, to work out, to mow the grass, at the beach, as well as when I dress up so it is also versatile. <end>  Good value for what I was wanting.  I was wanting a simple anklet that I could wear every day but it didn't have to be "fine jewelry". I was very skeptical about ordering jewelry that i couldn't see in person and touch. I've had this for about a month and a half now and I'm very satisfied with the way that the anklet has worn. I wear it 24/7 and it still looks as though it's brand new. I'm wanting this same chain as a bracelet now but I don't know that it exists. In my opinion this is a great buy and I would definitely recommend it. <end>  Cute and Perfect  The item was exactly as described. I wanted a little something not to flashy and this is perfect. The clasp is the main reason I chose this one. I would recommend this item and this seller. They shipped it either same day or next day and I got it the following day! <end>  Love it!  I put this anklet on when I got it and have not taken it off! It is very simple, durable and looks great! The price is right! <end>  shopper 2  I love the look of this anklet. Looks like it cost a lot more than what I paid. Can wear it with almost anything and it looks good. <end>  Lovely Anklet  Love this anklet, looks great and well made. Wear all the time. Looks like it cost more. Would buy again definitely. <end>  Beautiful!  It looks like this would cost a lot of money! It's absolutely beautiful and the price is outstanding!! The anklet is a great buy! <end>  Love It  I had been looking online for an anklet and came across this one. The reviews were good and so was the price so I placed my order. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I haven't taken it off since I got it (probably a week now). No problems showering with it on and it doesn't get caught on anything like others I have worn. If you are looking for a beautiful, simple but elegant anklet you will not be disappointed with this one. <end>  Nice chain..GREAT Price!  Anklet is very feminine and very attractive. Great little chain for the price. I wear it everyday.Thanks Gem Ave! <end>  Perfect little gift.  This is absolutely perfect. It fits very well and looks like it should cost much more than it did. The clasp is very strong so I don't worry about it coming loose and losing it. If you need the perfect gift for a girl of any age this is it. <end>
 B000ESNGJK  Sterling Silver Rhodonite Native Pearl Beaded Drop Earrings ||	  perfect  Bought these earrings to go with a rhodonite Carolyn Pollack ring. Perfect match and the earrings are the perfect size. They show up without being overpowering.

 B000ET4EGS  Tiger's eye ring, 'Golden Cat' 9.5 (US Ring size) ||	  incomplete information  What is the size of this ring? Can't order if size is not given. Looks like great quality, but no size given. <end>
 B000ET69G6  Turquoise earrings, 'Quiet Rain' 1.2" W 3.5" L ||	  turquoise earrings  These are the most stunning earrings I've ever seen! Gorgeous can't come close with how very beautiful they are!!! <end>
 B000ET7L72  Lapis lazuli choker, 'Three Blue Blossoms' ||	  A knock-out  I figured  I love lapis, and if it looks cheesy, I'll just send it back. But when the choker arrived, I was stunned. This piece is absolutely gorgeous and in exquisite taste. Not only that, but it also sparkles, which I had not expected. A real winner. <end>
 B000ETJBXE  Sterling Silver Script Initial Letter Z Alphabet Pendant Flawless Polish, 1 1/2 inch long ||	  Too long to be a pendant  In general, it is a good quality pendant. However, it is way too long for me. According to the description, the pendant should be 1 and 1/2 inch long. But it is inaccurate. The pendant is actually 2 inch long, 2 and 1/2 inch if include the loop. I bought it with the 16 inch chain, and the pendant just won't stay above my collar. I like this pendant in general, but it doesn't quite fit my expectation. <end>
 B000ETW4CO  .32 cttw Diamond 'Hugs and Kisses' 14k White Gold Ring (H-I Color, SI1-SI2 Clarity), Size 4.5 ||	  wonderful  I think this is the most beautiful ring I have ever seen and I wish it would become available again. <end>
 B000ETX2P2  Natural orchid gold earrings, 'Purple Tears' 1.2" W 1.4" L ||	  beautiful earrings! love them!  i got these earrings for my mom's biirthday and they are awesome. not only are they gorgeous and made out of real orchid petals, but they are also incredibly light weight. she put them on immediately and wore them the entire rest of the day. and the way they lay on the earlobe is so beautiful too. they have a slight curve to them so they curl under the earlobe a bit, and the color fades from light to dark- the darkest being the part curved slightly under the earlobe. they just look stunning on. very unique. <end>
 B000EU46B0  Natural rose brooch, 'Twin Love' 2" W 0.6" L ||	  Rose Brooch  The roses are small but beautiful. It's a perfect gift for someone and I love what the company does for artists. Great Stuff!! <end>
 B000EUF9FC  14 Karat Gold Toe Ring with Clear Gemstones ||	  toe ring  the product was of good quality and as shown in their ad. I am still wearing the ring, have been since I received it, with no problems. <end>  Nice Edition  This is a great toe ring and you can even shower with it on. I've had it for quite awhile and it is definitely fade resistant. <end>  A little bit of toe elegance  Daintier than expected as shown on picture, but I love it just the same.It's what I'd describe as a "classy" toe ring......if that's not a contradiction in terms.Because it's adjustable on top, as opposed to the bottom of the toe, it's very comfortable to wear in all shoes 24/7.Very pleased with my purchase; superfast delivery. <end>  A Summer Must Have!  I love his toe ring. It came in the mail today and I haven't taken the ring off. I only had the ring on for 2 hours before I recieved my first compliment. It is so comfortable. I don't even feel that I have it on. <end>
 B000EVMNY6  10K White Gold 1/10 ct. Diamond Cross Bracelet ||	  cross bracelet  I love this bracelet. It is perfect. The only thing that surprised me was that is was very light. I am afraid it will break. But it is exactly what I was looking for. It was worth the money that I paid for it. If you are looking for a light weight cross beautiful bracelet, then this is the one you want to purchase. <end>

 B000EW5YXW  Origin Turquoise Shell Necklace ||	  Ok item  The item arrived cracked. I shipped it back, and they did not have any other in stock. So I got a refund. If it was not crack, I'm sure my girl friend would have loved it. <end>
 B000EWFJPK  Turquoise and Apatite - Three Chain Earrings ||	  Very nice!  Loved these earrings as soon as I saw them. They arrived in 2 days and are just as pictured. Dainty stones and beautiful colors - exactly what I had been looking for. <end>
 B000EWHOC6  Black and Red Onyx Earrings ||	  O.K.  I bought these earrings to go with a specific red-based work outfit. They were a perfect match. The earrings look and feel a little cheap, but I don't care, and no one at work should ever be close enough to me to notice. Because they are so lightweight and have only hook backs, I'm sometimes afraid that I will lose them. I would recommend putting some rubber things on the back to make sure the hooks don't fall out of the ears. <end>
 B000EY615A  Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 4mm Omega Chain Necklace ||	  Omega Chain a winner  this chain was received in a resonable amount of time and was exactly as described. I am extreamly happy with it. I would reommend it to anyone. <end>  I love my SS necklace!  I am very pleased with the quality and price of my SS omega necklace. It is beautiful!! <end>  Quality jewlery  Love the necklace for its price and beauty. I wear it by itslef or with a silver pendant. <end>  Pretty, but...  The necklace is very pretty, but oddly, the necklace curls upwards, so is a little annoying. <end>  All Purpost Necklace  The quality and workmanship is every bit what I expected from Italian Silver. The clasp is easy to work and a size that allows the omega to be worn alone or as a chain for pendants. This necklace is truly all purpose. It lays flat against the skin when worn alone and still lays flat when different pendants are added.OME4M-20 Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 4mm Omega Chain 20" Necklace <end>
 B000EYPP2A  Blue Opal Heart belly button ring in 14 karat White Nickel Free Gold ||	  Horrible!  The ring is much smaller than what I anticipated. It doesn't resemble the photo at all. The color is completely off. I was very disappointed when I received the product. <end>
 B000EYS3WY  Sterling Silver Anklet 9" 9.5" 10" Length Adjustable Ankle Bracelet Made with Swarovski Elements Cultured Freshwater Pearl ||	  VERY PLEASED  This is truly a beautiful piece of jewelry, exactly what I was looking for and at a most reasonable price. In addition, it arrived in the mail more quickly than I had expected it to. I would definitely order from this company again. <end>  Very very beautiful .....  Fell in love at first site....very pretty. I wear as on my arm or on my ankle. Looks pretty either or. <end>  perfect for your ankle  I have a nice pearl necklace and earrings. I wanted an anklet to match but don't believe in spending as much on jewelry for my feet/ankles. This pearl anklet looks great with my finer quality pieces! Also, the construction seems to be strong; I won't worry about losing the jewelry off my leg. <end>  FRESHWATER PEARL ANKLER  THE ANKLET LOOKED FINE; EXCEPT, I GUESS I THOUGHT IT WAS STRUNG ON THREAD INSTEAD OF WIRE. ALL IN ALL, THEY WERE OKAY. <end>  love these!  I wear two of these, one on each ankle. They look very classy with thigh highs far more stylish than diamonds. Thank you! <end>  Love it!  Although these are imitation they are very well done. I bought three, one for my mother for mother's day, one for my aunt, and one for me. I think they will love them too. I received them fairly quickly and they are good quality. I will buy from this company again. <end>  SUPER CUTE  THIS IS A VERY NICE BRACELET IT LOOK SUPER CUTE, I REALLY LIKE IT, I GOT VERY FAST. I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT LOVE PEARLS <end>  Beautiful  I bought this for my daughter. Her birthday's a "June" birthday and this is her birth stone. I've never seen a pearl ankle bracelet anywhere. When I ran across this, I just HAD to get it. She loves it! <end>  Love it!  I love this anklet. It is beautiful. I am known for wearing anklets all summer and this fresh water pearl has been a hit. Lots of compliments. thank you. <end>
 B000EZ5D80  Sterling Silver Drop Earrings, 'Fish Bones' 0.4" W 2" L ||	  Fish Bones Earrings  Delivery was quicker than promised and my wife loves the earrings. I was hesitant when ordering because the lenth was listed at 2" but it was closer to 1.5" which was perfect. <end>
 B000F04SIK  Royal Blue Sapphire Ring - 10 ||	  You will be VERY pleased  This ring is EXACTLY like pictured. It is VERY beautiful and makes a statement without being too bold or gaudy. The detail is amazing. <end>  Beautiful ring leaves nasty "ring"  I bought this ring because I thought it was beautiful. Turns out, it turns my finger green and I cannot wear it. I wore it a total of a few days before I saw the green appearing and it made me very angry. I knew it wasn't white gold when I ordered it, but I thought that only bubble gum machine rings turned fingers green... I guess not. <end>  get what you pay for  it's pretty but beware it may leave behind a green ring. that old saying is ture so good luck. <end>  Good.  Good. little bit loose. i don't know if the diamonds are touching my skin on finger. The damonds should touch the skin for good results.thanks. <end>  Very Fake  This ring looks better in the picture when I got it you could see the stone pretty well but I think I didn't like the band otherwise it was okay.I was very disappointed. <end>
 B000F0XSQ8  Sterling Silver Ladybug Charm Bracelet , 3/8 inch (10 mm). ||	  disappointing  It would have been helpful to have the bracelet weight for comparison to other similar bracelets. The amount of silver is this bracelet was obviously limited because of its extreme light weight and unfinished look. The ladybugs were barely identifiable. Overall quality was disappointing. <end>
 B000F0ZPGE  Sterling Silver Celtic Charm Bracelet, 1/4 inch (6 mm) wide ||	  Celtic bracelets  I bought these for Cheer Leaders that cheer for the CELTICS,,,they are very well made, wonderful quality, and shipment was quick. <end>  A bit smaller than I thought  The detail is okay, the charms are a lot smaller than I anticipated. I ordered this to wear in my scottish wedding, and I will still wear it. It is pretty, just quite a bit smaller than I thought it was going to be. <end>
 B000F12CL4  Sterling Silver Beaded Bali Bracelet ||	  Nice!!  I like the quality and came in a timely manner but difficult to get on because of the clasp.I still wear it all he time! <end>  poorly made  I was very disappointed with this bangle. The clasp was very poor quality and the metal ring that fitted over the clasp fell off the second time I wore it. The metal ring was a piece of thin metal bent into a circle-shape. I will be sending this itemback. <end>
 B000F140O6  Gent's Sterling Silver Square Black Obsidian Ring ||	  Which finger to wear it on.  This ring was a little too small for my ring finger. It would have been better as a pinky ring. <end>  Sabrinas' Treasure Trove!  Sabrina won't dissapoint. The "fastest" delivery. And, without paying extra!Hundreds of choices available. Christmas is only around the corner (A greatstocking stuffer!) <end>  Black Obsidian Ring  I have been very pleased with the Sabrina Silver rings and would purchase as a gift in future. <end>

 B000F15YVY  Gent's Sterling Silver Triple Diagonal Black Obsidian Ring ||	  Beautiful Ring  I could not believe my eye's, this ring is beautiful, the quality & craftsmanship A + 1 guys you can jump on this one! <end>  You Won't Be Disappointed  This ring rocks! Beautifully machined with tight, even seams and a heavy, substantial feel, this ring epitomizes simple masculine elegance. The silver is polished to a near-mirror finish and the band is thick and wide. The black obsidian is more translucent than onyx giving it a depth that reveals the inner patterns of the stone. This is sure to be an eye-catcher when worn with either casual or dress attire. You won't be disappointed. <end>
 B000F15ZO0  Gent's Sterling Silver Rectangular Striped Tiger Eye Ring ||	  beautiful stones  thank you for such careful packaging. this ring has beautiful stones and a solid band. <end>
 B000F15ZQI  Gent's Sterling Silver Black Obsidian with Tiger Eye Ring ||	  Beautiful, cool, masculine awesome ring!  This ring looks even better in person. It looks very expensive. And the shipping was very quick. Really great buy from Amazon! <end>
 B000F15ZTK  Gent's Sterling Silver Striped Tiger Eye Ring ||	  Unique and good value  Just as some other reviews mentioned, the shipping process for this ring was fantastic. I received it within a couple of days after the order. The ring came with a simple box, but well protected and wrapped. The ring was in great condition, shining 925 silver with unique tiger eye stones. The ring and the tiger eye parts are well cut and smoothly connected (the piture on the website looks ruffer than the real ring). Not to mention the great deal I got from the website. Highly recommend this product!! <end>  Amazing!!  This ring is an awesome find at this or any price. The pictures here do not! do this ring any justice,the lines are clean and crisp,the stones are perfectly cut and fitted.I am blown away by the quality of this ring. <end>  Exceeded Expectations  This elegant sterling silver tiger eye ring surpassed my expectations. This is one SERIOUSLY good-looking ring. It's even sharper in person than the photo at amazon suggests. It also has a substantial feel to it. Both materials and workmanship appear first-rate. I consider it a steal for the money. If you're looking for a handsome tiger eye ring at an amazingly reasonable price, I do NOT think you'll be disappointed. In fact, I think you will be overjoyed when you put this on. And no, I don't work for sabrina or amazon. I'm just a dude who was looking to replace a beloved amber ring that I lost playing a gig one night, and I think this tiger eye rocks the house in every way. <end>  Tigers eye ring  Fast delivery and good communication from seller. Excellent ring, very very pleased. Highly recommended. <end>

 B000F165WG  Sterling Silver 8 mm Southwest Design LOVE Ring 5/16 inch wide Hand Made ||	  Really big stuff.  this ring, to me, looked a little more dainty than it turned out to be. It's almost too chunky. The lettering isn't engraved into the silver as it looks either, it's more like the ring is hollow and the letters are holes.ehhh... it's ok. Don't love it, don't hate it. <end>
 B000F1679W  Gent's Sterling Silver Large Oval Tiger Eye Ring ||	  Love This Ring  My ring fits perfectly and looks great. I am totally satisfied. I wear it every day.

I would buy from them again without any concerns <end>  The ring  This is so fare a ring i really like and the tiger eye is okI will buy an other one later this is a great deal <end>  lost money and time  First they sent me a ring with a huge crack on gem.Then I sent it back.It was in October 2009.On January 7 I was informed that they sent me replacement.But I haven't got anything.The result I have nothing for my money. <end>
 B000F17JQC  Amazon.com  Sabre Tooth Earrings (As Shown;One Size)  Clothing ||	  These hurt!!!  I got these as an accessory to a Halloween costume. they matched great but they pinched my ears really bad. I would not recommend buying these unless you have tough ears. <end>

 B000F19KYQ  Gent's Sterling Silver Triple Stripes Malachite Ring ||	  Outstanding quality.  Just received this ring this week. Quality is outstanding, fit and finish very fine, every detail excellent. was thrilled with the price , delivery and quality of my ring. Sabrina jewelers did a wonderful job. thanks go to them. ohhhh yes, very nice unique design, already getting compliments. <end>  almost perfect  I was happy with ring. Workmanship was good, i liked the appearance. My only complaint was that they don't have half sizes.Mine was a little tight. <end>
 B000F19LGI  Sterling Silver Black Obsidian with Synthetic Turquoise Ring ||	  Very Satisfied  This ring was better than what I expected. It looks even better in person than the picture! My order was shipped promptly and arrived in good condition. I will order from Sabrina Silver again, without question.~~Update  The stones chip easily. <end>  extremely satisfied  I really was attracted to this ring as soon as I saw it and once I purchased it I found out it was a one size too small. I had no problem with the company in exchanging it for another a size bigger and since receiving it, I am very satisified with the product and have received a lot of compliments for it. <end>  Turguoise Ring  This is a very pretty ring, and my Husband LOVES it. Sabrina Silver is a great company. I have bought several pieces from them. This ring was a last minute order for X-mas and it was suppose to come "after" X-mas. I ordered it Thursday night before X-mas and received it Tuesday before X-mas..of course I had to give it to my husband right away, since he had given me my gift already...lol I will be buying more things from Sabrina Silver, great products and super service.... <end>
 B000F19SLQ  Gent's Sterling Silver Square Black Obsidian Ring ||	  Very nice-looking, masculine, solid ring  I was actually looking for an onyx & silver ring, but this one looks just as good. It's a good size, but not too big. Shipping was very quick. This is a nice alternative to a wedding band. It has a cool, sleek look & it's very expensive-looking, so it's really a great buy. <end>
 B000F1MXAE  Blitz Delicate Gem & Pearl Cleaner 8oz ||	  Wonderful stuff  This is great for my emeralds and pearls---there are not many products that you can use for them, so I was thrilled to find this. <end>  Pearly White  This is one product that I'm glad I've bought. I've a set of Mikimoto pearl earrings which I had for a decade. I would usually give it a water rinse and once in a while with soap. It had become dull and lacking in lustre. Blitz Pearl cleaner changed all that! Now my pearls are shiny and whiter. <end>  Cleans well  No complaints, cleans well and gives a nice shine. Relatively easy to use, works well on diamonds and pearls! Worth the $ for sure! <end>  It sucks  Don't waste your money!! It made mine more tarnished and weird looking. I would not buy this product if I could have a redo <end>  wrong item  the product I got was the wrong jewelry cleaner it is the original cleaner it was not for pearls or gems. It was labeled pearls and gem cleaner by the person I bought it from. I will keep it any way for my other jewelry.. It says in the back of the jewelry cleaner not to use it on gems and pearls.... <end>  Wrong product shipped to me.  I'm sure that this product does what it says it does, but I can't tell you for sure, because it never reached me. I ordered the delicate gem and pearl cleaner for my engagement ring, which has pearls in the setting. What I received was the standard formula which clearly states that it is not safe to use on pearls. I've never had this problem with Amazon before, but needless to say I'm very disappointed. <end>  No included Brush???  While clearly brand new and sealed, the product DID NOT come with a jewelry brush as the description indicated. Neither was one mentioned on the outside of the product itself. Now I'm trying to find a seperate jewelry brush to use with the product as I don't have one kicking around already...what a pain. <end>  I've only used it once.. seems great so far!  The product came so quickly.. I was very happy about that. It also had good instructions, and was packaged well. Like it very much for cleaning pearls. <end>  Not the best  This stuff is expensive. Especially considering how well it works. A little lemon joy and warm water works much better and does not leave a film behind. Will keep looking for a safe cleaner. <end>  a great cleaner  I have several opal rings that had not been worn for quiet a while and needed cleaning. This product did a great job and my stones have more depth of color than they have had in a long time. I highly recommend this product. <end>
 B000F1MXFE  The Ultra II TM Jewelry Cleaning Machine ||	  Excellent Service - Product As Promised  I've used Blitz jewelry cleaning machines in the past. They last and last and last. Needed to replace one that was lost. The Ultra II I purchased via Amazon lives up to my past experience with Blitz  quick performing, quiet and, most important, quality cleaning. Its ultrasonic feature cleans much better than any manual (brush and cleaning fluid)does. The metal - be it gold, silver, platinum or plated - and the gems (precious, semi-precious or glass) shine and sparkle. Recommend it to anyone. <end>
 B000F1MXOA  Jewelry Care Cloth ||	  Great way to care for jewelry!  I had never seen this type of product before for jewelry. I had just purchased a cubic zirconia ring that you cannot use regular jewelry cleaner on so I was pleased to try this product. Well, it really makes the ring sparkle and shine. I have tried it on my gold jewelry and it does a great job on that as well. <end>
 B000F1MXOK  Blitz Gem and Jewelry Cleaner ||	  Great jewelry cleaner!!!  This is the best jewelry cleaner I have used in years!!! Cleans my platinum and diamonds so well they really do sparkle. Quick, easy. <end>  Cleans well  Worked wonderfully on our jewelry. As noted in the description this does NOT remove silver tarnish, it's made mainly for cleaning gems. <end>  Great Product  This made my wedding/engagement set sparkle all over again. I have a necklace/earring set that I want to try it on. Nothing has worked on them so far. I will edit my review after I try it. <end>  Great Product  It will get your jewelry clean, fast! I have been using this brand for several years and I love it! I would definitely recommend this product. <end>  Blitz Jewelry cleaner  Blitz is an excellent jewelry cleaner. It cleans all types of jewelry without all the toxic smell and harsh cleaners. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and safe jewelry cleaner. <end>  Works for me  This was a refill for a sonic jewelry cleaner that was a gift from my husband. This works very well for pierced earings and backs, rings, necklaces, and any jewelry that fits in the basket. Is easy to use and the basket keeps you from having to dig smaller items out of the cleaner.Blitz 8 Oz Jewelry Cleaner with Cleaning Basket <end>  jewelry cleaner  I was looking for a jewelry cleaner for my diamond jewelry, and this product works super well! It doesn't have an unpleasant odor and comes with a very convenient basket and brush. It gets my jewelry looking very clean in a few minutes time! I like the fact that it's non-toxic as well. Great product! <end>  Almost too good  love it, works great. Just kind of nasty that everything after the first time will be in the dirty solution as well. <end>  Great Product  Great product! Comes with cleaning brush for hard to reach areas, and leaves jewelry sparkling clean! Would definitely recommend and would buy again. <end>  Exactly what I needed  When I purchased a engagement ring for my wife, the store had their own brand of cleaner, which they gave us for free. After it was time to replace it, I looked and saw it was made by Blitz. So I ordered this. <end>  Nice, non-stinky cleaner  This is the typical jewelry cleaner in a jar with two big exceptions First, it doesn't stink. There's no ammonia in it, so you don't have to hold it at arms' length to keep it out of sniffing distance.Secondly, it's non-toxic. Most of the other jewelry cleaners contain chemicals which are extra worrisome in a household with children. While I'd still recommend keeping it out of the reach of children, it's one less chemical in the house.Most importantly, in addition to being more pleasant and safer, it actually cleans jewelry well. My ring, earrings and necklace were shining when I had finished with them.There is a small basket and brush included with the jar. The basket doesn't have a hole to hold the brush in place, so it needs to be dug out of the bottom of the jar. Plus, the brush is pretty useless. The bristles are too long, so they just get swiped to the side when you try to use it.Secondly, the basket doesn't hold much in. The directions say to shake gently. Even the gentlest shake causes the jewelry to fall out of the basket and that, too, needs to be dug out of the bottom of the jar. Overall, because of the great job it does and its safer formula, I'd certainly recommend it. <end>  Easy/Effective  My father is a jeweler, and he gave this to my fiancee to clean her ring with. It's super easy to use, and does a great job at cleaning up jewelry. We've always used old toothbrushes to really get jewelry clean, so I can't say that we've had any issues with the basket or brush. I would recommend this product to a friend. <end>  shiny shiny  My Wife really likes this cleaner for her wedding and engagement bands. She says it cleans them almost without use of the brush. Her rings are somewhat complex, center diamond with halo and many small side diamonds. I bought this for her after I was deployed to Afghanistan, it was cheap, worked well, and made her happy. What more do I need? <end>  Blitz Gem & Jewelry Cleaner  This is a dynamic product! I have been searching for a reasonably priced jewelry cleaner and this is the one for me. I highly recommend it. <end>  Yay! My jewelry is clean, and it was so easy.  Cleans jewelry within moments, and no scrubbing involved! I was so sick of the paste that I would have to use toothpicks getting out from my jewelry. Love this stuff! <end>  Dazzling briliance in a plastic jar  Best liquid, no fuss jewelry cleaner I have used. Fairly priced and convenient to use. Non-toxic cleaner for use on non-porous precious and semi-precious gems as well as precious jewelry.Jar contains liquid cleaner and a submersible plastic basket (just place jewels or rings into this basket and lower basket into the non-toxic, but strong-smelling solution). Small brush for removing surface grime is included. Lift basket after a short time; place contents onto clean, dry towel or paper towels. Rinse items with warm water before wearing.Blitz's pricing, convenience, and performance are hard to beat! <end>  Great cleaner  Great cleaner and love that it's non-toxic. It worked great at cleaning my rings - I couldn't stop looking at them the all next day! Would buy the product again because it's non-toxic and doesn't stink. <end>  Cleans well, but container leaks  I ordered this to clean my new engagement ring. The cleaner works well, but does leave a little bit of a sticky feeling on my hands and my ring despite rinsing repeatedly. The worst part about it though is that the cap does not seem to screw on securely and it is constantly leaking. I would not recommend this product because of this. I ordered a different brand of cleaner to replace it. <end>  Useless  Jewelry came out just as bad as it went in. Toothbrush and toothpaste does a far better job. Waste of money. <end>  Gentle & effective  Since getting engaged and then married, I've needed to clean my platinum and diamond jewelry frequently. I love how quickly yet gently this product works and it keeps my jewelry looking sparkly for a long time. I've let very dirty jewelery soak overnight and then used the included brush to scrub it with great results. <end>  Effective cleaning product  I've been using this product for the past eight years and it's kept my engagement and wedding rings nice and shiny and clean! Very effective cleaning product. <end>  Easy  Easy breezy solution when you realize you are out of cleaner. Got this in two days. Would definitely do again. <end>  No sparkle or shine  I bought this product to clean my silver jewelry. It cleaned it somewhat but I have had to put it in the cleaner more then once and for an extended period of time. Really not satisfied with the results. I would not recommend this product. <end>  Blitz Jewelry Cleaner  We've used this before which is why I ordered more from Amazon. It does a fantastic job of cleaning jewelry and I recommend it to anyone wanting to keep their rings, etc. sparkling. <end>  Just what I wanted  It does just what it's supposed to and works great - just dip, rinse and dry. my pure silver necklace gets green so fast, I guess it's my skin. But this does the trick every time. <end>  Doesn't clean silver jewelry  I bought this product specifically to clean my silver jewelry, which came out of the basket just as tarnished/oxidized as when it went in. Cheap toothpaste and a toothbrush works better - I'll stick to that from now on. <end>  Did not work  This product did not clean my silver jewelry at all. Looked the same when it came out of the basket. I tried to use a brush and cloth, but nothing worked. I bought this product thinking it was the Blitz jewelry cloths (those actually work well). I will never buy the liquid again. <end>  Not Great  I ordered this cleaner for a pair of silver earrings that were tarnishing. I followed the instructions on the package and the tarnish did not go away. This cleaner does not work well and I would not recommend it. <end>  not happy with the results  not happy at all with the results, I got this item to clean my silver, I have no idea if i got the wrong one ... I used to have one silver cleaner and once i dip the silver and in 5 sec looked like new, anyway I should read more reviews before purchase it, thanks <end>  Does This Even Work?  I saw all the positive reviews so I bought this cleaner. It is odorless, but it hasn't been able to clean any of my sterling silver jewelry! I followed the directions and my jewelry is still dull looking. I paid a lot for this cleaner and shipping it to me cost as much as the cleaner itself! Talk about frustrated and disappointed. Next time, I will buy a cleaner from an area variety store. It can't be any worse as far as effectiveness and this way I can return it in person should it not work. <end>  Works like a champ  This product works well and the cost is great. I really like Stuhllers brand, but you cannot get it unless you are a jewler and my jewler doesn't carry it anymore because they make the customer buy it in bulk. So I decided to take a chance on this brand based on reviews. I like the fact it doesnt smell and am always in favor of the interior basket and brush. <end>  Should have known  This product for starters - once opened LEAKS!. The cleaning is mediocre. Not worth it. Thank god it was only a few bucks. <end>  Works wonders!  Thank you so much for the Blitz Gem & Jewelry Cleaner! It worked wonders on my Great Aunts old costume jewelry. I was happy to see it came with a brush for cleaning. Only thing I'd have to say I didn't like is that the product burned my skin when touching the jewelry, so PLEASE WEAR GLOVES when cleaning with this product! If I had, this would be a perfect review! <end>  Works, but . . .  This jewelry cleaner does just what it's supposed to. I put my diamond rings in dirty and dingy, they came out sparkling and brilliant! I like that it is non-toxic and also clear (I've had cleaner before that was red and if any spilled it would leave red residue). The only thing I don't like is that there is no holder for the little scrubby brusht that comes with it. I've had previous cleaners that would have a place for the brush to stand up to make it easier to retrieve. Does that make it not worth buying? No, but it is slightly irritating. Does the job and glad I purchased it! <end>  jewelry cleaner  may need to immerse jewelry longer than suggested time.Seemed to work well.I used the cleaner once, on a lot of jewelry, earrings especially, it made everything sparkle.I needed to use a separate cleaning and polishing cloth on some of my silver rings. <end>  Wedding ring bliss  I got tired of running out to the jewelers to have my wedding rings cleaned. So I nervously searched for a jewelery cleaner to have on hand at home. I'm happy to say that this cleaner works wonders on the intricate detailing and diamonds of my wedding set without harsh chemical smells. The instructions clearly state which precious metals and gems are compatible with this specific cleaner. Also, I have very sensitive skin, and I have no problems using my bare hands with this product. <end>  What One Might Expect  Product arrived in good shape and reasonable time. What can one say about jewelry cleaner? It cleaned my jewelry. The brush was too soft to accomplish anything, but anyone who gets his/her teeth cleaned on a regular schedule has too many old toothbrushes hanging around anyway. I just used one of those. <end>  Better for metals than stones  Blitz cleaner did restore my vintage platinum engagement ring's luster, but didn't fully clean out the crevices around the stone, even with the help of the provided brush. This is great for an at-home product, but probably isn't a substitute for having a jeweler clean your ring -- just a stop gap measure for in-between. <end>  My earrings look great  The cleaner arrived yesterday and I tried cleaning a pair of earrings this morning. I soaked them for about hour and when I finished, they looked great. I usually use hairspray in my hair and I sometimes put my earrings in beforehand. Over the years, hairspray has built up on several pairs of earrings and this cleaned it all off! The only drawback is the brush provided to bush off the loosened dirt does not work well. I found a toothbrush works much better. After I brushed them and dried them in a paper towel they looked like new! <end>  It didn't do what it supposed to....  We usually buy similar product from Target which was very very good. I wanted to try this one, but we are not at all satisfied with the results. We have poured almost all the liquid on a silver plate. But there is no difference at all.Then we tried the same old product, it was amazing.I recommend "Connoisseurs Revitalizing Silver Jewelry Cleaner". <end>  Works so so  I have used this on a few pieces of jewelry. It works alright, but the items you put in certainly don't come out sparkling. You then have to scrub them a bit or use a tarnish cloth. <end>  Best Jewelry Cleaner  I would order this product again but it lasts a long time and not too many products do now a days.Thank you! <end>  SHINY SHINY SHINY just what U want!!!  )  WOW!!! Blitz Gem and Jewelry Cleaner is the Best, yes, yes, yes I recommend itIt will make your precious jewelry shine and sparkle like new, and you'll be able to clean your jewelry with or with out the machine. I do both and the price is right.Blitz Gem & Jewelry Cleaner Concentrate (8 Oz) <end>  Cleaner is great, Brush Sucks  The actual solution does a good job of cleaning - bought this to clean my engagement ring. Also, the price is right. I have taken the container with me on trips and since it's so inexpensive I can always leave it and buy a new one when I come home. The downside is the brush which is poorly made and the bristles don't scrub so much as limply flop. That being said, you can easily buy a toothbrush to use with the solution and this will provide a much better &#34;scrub&#34; <end>  Totally worth it!  I never knew this product existed until my mother-in-law told me about it. The first time I used it I had to have my own! It will make your precious jewelry shine and sparkle like new, and you'll be able to clean it whenever you want to right at home! <end>  AMAZING  THE CLEANER COMES WITH A BASKET AND A LITTLE BRUSH SO YOU CAN CLEAN YOUR JEWERLY ITEMS VERY WELL. AND THE BRUSH LETS YOU CLEAN IN AROUND PRONES ON RINGS AND GEMS. <end>  Great!!!  Works great. This is the second time I buy it and I will use the product for years to come. <end>  Makes jewelry sparkle!  I ran out of my last batch of this product and found the replacement here. GREAT price, no need to hunt it down in a store! <end>  Sparkle is Back  I've purchased this item before and it always works well. Even a quick dip will brighten you jewelry. I like my rings,etc. to look good. <end>  blitz jewelry cleaner  the cleaner works fine but the jar it comes in is not well made and it is difficult to open and close. It makes a mess every time I use it. The last jar I had was made from better material, but this is just junk!!! I will not purchase this item again. <end>  Does it job, easy to use.  Easy to use, no fuss. The brush included is decent. I work in a paint store and need to clean my ring a lot. I find I need a firmer brush than was included. I did end up spilling it after about three months and will try a different cleaner this time. It didn't seem out of thus works great. <end>  Not correctly described  Blitz 8 Oz Jewelry Cleaner with Cleaning BasketThe product is described as a jewelry cleaner, but there is no mention of the fact that it does not clean silver jewelry. As I bought it to clean silver jewelry, it is totally useless, so the money I spent was thrown away. So now I know Amazon's product descriptions are not always as complete as they should be. Glad I learned the lesson on a small item. <end>  Blitz Jewelry Cleaner  This stuff doesn't work any better than soap and water. Seems to clean flat polished gold OK but that is all. Saddle <end>  Does not work!  I used this solution on all my silver necklaces and it didn't do a thing. They look exactly the same. I don't know if the one I got was the wrong formula, but I now need to buy something else. <end>
 B000F1OTDI  Ultra Jewelry Cleaning & Polishing Cloth ||	  Jewelry polishing cloth  Works wonderfully with my sonic jewelry cleanter. I wouln't want to be without one, ever! <end>  Didn't receive the item!!!!!  Although the fault is not Amazon's,the product which was ordered and paid for was never delivered to the designated recipient. <end>
 B000F1QVRK  Professional Jewelry Care Cloth 12" x 15" ||	  Great Silver & Gold Polishing Cloth!  I have used this cloth for my silver jewelry projects, and I love how shiny and bright it makes them. These cloths are great for getting rid of even heavy tarnish.I would recommend having one at home for your silver jewelry. You won't regret it. Everything looks like brand new! <end>
 B000F1QVZM  Lacquered Brass and Metal Care Cloth ||	  Great Product!  I thought that this product was very good!I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas because he loves watches. He cleaned a very very filthy watch to beautiful condition.Im not sure why the other reviewer had such a bad experience. It came with all the tools that they said it would and the tools were great at cleaning all the little nooks in the watch.I like the foam for cleaning all of my jewelry. <end>  Stay Away from This  The most unreliable product I have ever purchased. Different from how they market the product, does not do the job. <end>
 B000F1V6KM  Southwestern Style Animal Track ( Raccoon, Moose, Mountain Lion, Coyote, Beaver, Gray Wolf and Bear ) Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 7 1/2, #11873 ||	  beautiful  This ring is just exactly as it's pictured, and simply gorgeous -- and Taos Trading's customer service  fantastic. Highly recommended. . . . <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I love this ring... I love wildlife especially wolves and to have their tracks in turquoise on a beautiful sterling silver ring is awesome. You can't go wrong with this one! <end>
 B000F1Z144  Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1mm Omega Chain Necklace ||	  Perfect !  This Omega necklace is the perfect size and gauge for fused glass pendants. I am ordering several more. Thanks! <end>  Omega Chain  I have bought a 14" omega chain which is good. Unfortunately, there is no alert that the 14" size chain is is intended for children. I know its not the sellers' fault but mine, however, seller should alert the buyer that the size 14" chain is not intended for adult.Its beautiful. <end>  chain  very pretty chain...great price and pretty good quality. i work with 20 kids, who are 3, and have worn the chain with a pendant on it for a couple months and its bent in one spot but i think it has been wonderful and i would buy it again <end>  Necklace  I got the necklace and it is everything I thought it would be. I really like it. <end>  I look good  I put the cross on it and good to go <end>  Not good for pendants  I wish I had given more credibility to the negative reviews. Frankly, I don't understand how there ecould be so many positive reviews. It's an ok chain - if you want to wear it by itself. But it's not good for pendants, as advertised. It remains perfectly stiff and oval shaped when worn - even a large pendant doesn't pull the chain down as a pendant normally does. I'm returning it. <end>  22" OMEGA  THIS OMEGA IS SO PRETTY. IT IS STURDY AND WILL HOLD ALL OF YOUR PENDANTS...I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY BUY ONE FROM THIS SELLER. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY SHINY AND I LOVE IT 5 STARS ALL THE WAY ) <end>  the kind of chain i like  i bought this omega chain sometime last month June 2009 and it just fit me right..i love it..the shipping was super fast that i didnt expect that it would come that day..i would really recommend this Seller to everyone..i would definitely wants to purchase again to this seller.. <end>  Silver Necklace...1MM Omega  The Italian Sterling Silver Omega Chain Necklace looked a bit dainty but it is not! It is strong and beautiful. Looks great with or without a pendant. I love it! Excellent for summer because it is not too heavy.Thanks for a great product. <end>  Great Necklace!  I love this necklace. I needed a chain thin enough to go through a slide pendant that I love. This necklace is perfect! Thin enough to slide through the slots and sturdy enough to hold it with no problems. I've worn it just about everyday since it arrived. Fast service, I was very pleased. I will buy many more times from this seller! <end>  Great Buy!  The is a beautiful necklace that looks great alone or with a slide. I purchased it for my 18 yr. old daughter and she loves it. Excellent quality for an excellent price. <end>  silver necklace from Gem  item is much nicer than the picture.My girls were so pleased, I had purchased some handwrought pendants on a vacation in Greece this summer and they looked lovely on the chains! <end>  A+ Product  I ordered this omega to go with a slide pendant. I was at my wits end trying to find a chain with a clasp small enough to fit through the opening, without dropping $50+. Not only did this omega fit and look perfect, but the shipping and was super-fast too. This necklace looks and feels much more expensive than it was. I will definately purchase from this seller again. <end>  quality necklace.  very nice omega chain for the price. i would definitely shop with this seller again. <end>  The perfect answer  I had ordered a pendant to wear to a family wedding and needed a chain. This Omega was the perfect answer. This item is well worth the money. <end>  Not very good at all  This necklace is like a strong circle of silver. there was almostno bend to it at all and it was not fluid. <end>  False Advertising!!!  This is NOT a chain necklace. If you buy this product you will get an 18" long, 1.26 mm diameter tube with tiny notches along its surface. The "strong lobster clasp" looks like it's made of cheap plastic. <end>  Excellent Quality Omega  Omegas are stiff. That is their characteristic. They are pre-formed to remain round and keep their shape while wearing. These are not fluid chains. Generally, they are worn close to the neck and able to support the weight of heavier pendants and enhancers. These are strong chains. Omegas tend not to slide around the neckline. While wearing, it's unlikely the back closure will drift to the front of the neck. Pendants and enhancers tend to stay put. This can be thought of as a "silver collar".Often, Omegas are 3 or 4mm thick. I was happy to get this one in the 1mm. It fits the bale on most of my pendants. I have a 4mm that will only accommodate large bales.This is an excellent quality Italian omega, at a great price. The silver has a nice gleam, it's smooth, and has a lobster claw clasp. It's made very well. Thanks, Gem Avenue.If you want a freely moving chain, this seller has a large selection of really good quality silver chains...all at reasonable prices. If you want a very smooth, solid looking chain. I recommend a snake chain. It looks similar to an omega, but has fluidity. <end>  Beautiful chain  This chain is really gorgeous. I was very impressed when it arrived. It is really hard to find chains of this length, especially of this quality. I love it! <end>  Great chain for petite a neck.  I have been on a lifelong search for 14 & 15 inch chains. I have a petite neck, and need the smaller length. This chain is not only the right size, it is very pretty and substantial for the price. thanks you for making it available. <end>  14" Omega Silver Chain Necklace  I bought this necklace for my own use. I am a small adult. It is just what I have been looking for and doesn't look like something just for a child. The necklace is beautiful and perfect! I am enjoying wearing it with various pendants.Attractive Sterling Silver 1 MM Italian Box Link Chain 14" 16" 18" 20" 22" 24" 30" Necklace <end>  Just what I hoped for!  I ordered two of these 1 MM Omega chains to go with gift pendants and, they were everything I was hoping for. Strong, shiney, secure lobster clasp, and able to give some extra "lift" to show off the pendant. I ordered thin Omegas such as these so that I could slide the pendants on easily. I am using one of them myself with a large, simple gemstone that I wish to showcase. Advice  Try this company! Nice customer service, great product and price, small gift boxes that you can wrap before giving, and good delivery. <end>  nice gift for a young girl  I ordered this necklace for a young girl to hold a little turtle pendant I purchased for her. The pendant has some weight and does come with its own chain, but I thought the omega would give this young girl a different, but still delicate look. She will be able to use this chain with any pendant she may have or receive in the future. It's a sweet necklace that, once she grows out of it, can be passed on to one of her younger sisters. I was pleased with my purchase. <end>  Very nice necklace - love it!  This necklace is very nice. Its like a choker necklace but at a better price. Looks to be of good quality it will work well as a casual necklace if your looking for something more then you will have to pay more. As the saying goes you get what you pay for. Really its a very nice necklace. <end>  AWESOME  I needed a chain for my cross it works well and good price came in a jewel box I love it thanksa little tight for my neck but I like it that way I don't want to be mistakin for a rapper <end>
 B000F25DCI  Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1.5mm Rope Chain Necklace ||	  Nice quality  Beautiful shiny SS necklace chain. I got it to put a SS pendant on it that I already owned. I'm very happy with it. <end>  Vernette  Just received this today and it is very well made and I will order some more later on.Highly recommend. <end>  Love it!  Great quality necklace. Appears to be made sturdy. Beautiful and has a nice shimmer to it. I would definitely buy this product again! <end>  Very Beautiful!  This item came faster than the estimated shipping which I am very happy about. Plus the necklace was just astonishing! It's so beautiful! and looks like it was way more expensive! I'm way more than pleased with this item( I even want to get one for myself). <end>  Stiff but nice  it has very little give in the arch. It cannot be bent like the picture, and would likely snap with that much pinch (or that forceful of a tug on your pendant). Otherwise, it looks nice. <end>  Perfect, exactly what I wanted!  This is perfect chain for pendants and such. Well made. Looks wonderful. The fact it has no nickel in it makes me very happy. Sometimes bothers her skin a little. This is the perfect with 1.5 mm. <end>  Would not purchase again!  This item shipped folded up in a little bag. It had lots of kinks in it. Would not purchase again! <end>  Beautiful chain  Perfect strong yet deceivingly delicate-looking chain. I purchased a pendant which came with a flimsy chain and swapped this one in. It sparkles brightly and can be used for light- to heavy- pendants of higher quality metal. FYI  The chain is wrapped in a way that keeps it from being as flexible as lighter chains. <end>  absolutely love it.  I bought this chain to wear with a silver cross. I was a little apprehensive since the price was so reasonable. What a great decision it was! It has a beautiful luster to it. I've been wearing it everyday for over a month or two and it still looks new. I'm ordering another shorter one soon. Great company to do business with. Don't be afraid to order from them. You actually get what see. Very fast shipping too! I will be checking out the earring selection after I order another necklace. Shop with confidence. <end>  Love My New Sparkly Chain  I'm very pleased with the quality of the chain. The diamond cuts really make the chain sparkle. For the price, It's a very nice chain. It came in a nice box and arrived very fast. <end>  Quality product.  I was looking for a replacement for my old cheap tarnished steel chain, and was having a difficult time finding a long enough chain in retail. Comparing length and price I would have ended up paying double for something shorter but similar.I was glad I found this chain. The price was amazing for the quality I received. I've had it for about a month now and am still extremely satisfied with it.The shipping was also very fast. It was a little longer than most reviews were suggesting, but I was also ordering into Canada. The shipment took a about a two weeks to arrive. <end>  silver rope  this is a very pretty rope chain. I like the brightness of it. it's small enough that the pendant I put on fit easily. I like the secure clasp. I will look at Gem Avenue products on Amazon in the future too. <end>  Real Nice Chain  When I received this chain I was really pleased. It has a nice feel on the neck and a good size clasp. I wanted something long to wear with my Widow's Mite.The chain shows off the coin beautifully. <end>  "Beautiful Necklace and Quick Secured Packaging"  "A++++I simply love the necklace, its sparkling and very eye catching, beautiful product. Quick service, safely secured packaging with silver gift box. Great doing business with you!! Thank you so much!! A++++" <end>  Good  Its a nice chain, a lot thicker than I thought... 1.5 mm didnt look that big on my ruler. Very shiny, almost white in some lights. It is almost too big for the pendant I had.Make sure you know what size you are looking for! <end>  Great value for money  Item was delivered quite promptly. I was happy with the value for the money. The chain is very nice looking and has held up well so far. <end>  20 inch Silver chain  This was exactly was I was looking for. I bought two, one for myself and one as a gift. The narrow end has allowed me to swap out most of my pendants. The silver is beautiful. Perfect with all my Turquoise!Thank you for your fast shipping too! <end>  Only $20 bucks?  This was a great piece of jewelry finely crafted. I cant believe the price was so low. It worked great for holding the charm I had bought. <end>  Very nice chain  I wanted a beautiful silver chain with a narrow end that I could slip through my pendant. Perfect. Nice length, color and thickness. <end>  Great chain, great price!  I am so glad that someone out there is making sterling silver chains both beautiful and AFFORDABLE. The quality of this chain is evident - there is nothing artificial about it. The chain and lobster clasp are strong. The luster is perfect. (I've seen chains from other retailers that actually looked "dipped" and artificial.) Note  Because it is a rope chain, it might appear chinked upon arrival. Try to gently smoothe it out with your fingers before having a fit!! If it remains a problem, I know first-hand that Gem Avenue will be quick to remedy the problem. Nice, simple gift boxes are provided. Friendly customer service. I know that I will use them again! <end>  this company is great and willing to work with you  I had purchased the necklace being shown here, although do to my own mistake i assumed it would be more of a man's style necklace, and heavier, so i had to return it, but the quality and design itself were of high quality, if i'd have been a female or had someone to give it to i would have kept it, and then continued shopping again.with returning the necklace, the company had NO (0) issues with my asking for a refund and processed it in less than 24 hours, I would be happy to continue using this company for further purchases, seeing how they have the customer's satisfaction in mind, not just one of those companies that's worried about a bottom line, and making you jump through hoops to deal with a refund or credit.this is one of the greatest companies i've dealt with in the past 10 years i've been buying any style of jewelery online.very prompt and efficient in handling questions, concerns they really bend over backwards to maker their customers happy and satisfied. <end>  Beautiful Quality Chain and Great Service  Very pleased with the 24" chain-just perfect to hold a mounted coin pendant. The chain is very strong and it looks beautiful as well. Can't determine how it's going to hold up to continued use since I just received it, but so far very happy with the purchase. The shipping service was very speedy and I appreciate that as well. If I ever need to purchase any other pieces, I'll be checking out Gem on Amazon. <end>  I love my new rope chain  I wore my new sterling silver neck chain for the first time yesterday. I received 0ne compliment after another all day. I was so impressed by the quality and beauty of my new jewelry. I could not believe the price, very reasonable and the delivery service was speedy. Thank you I will be ordering again. You sure take the work out of shopping. <end>  great quality jewlery  I ordered this silver chain necklace to go with a miniature silver urn I bought and it matches perfect. The silver is so shiny and pretty. Its a durable necklace but delicate also. Its perfect to wear by itself or to attach a charm to. I wear it all the time and it does not wear away like lots of other necklace's do. Its light weight as well.Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1.5 MM Rope 24" Chain NecklaceIts good quality. The clasp is easy to use and durable. I would definitely order again from this company in the future. <end>  love it  I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction. <end>  Very pretty necklace!  The Italian Sterling Silver necklace was more than I thought it would be. I wear it with my white gold pendants & you can't tell the difference. It has a lot of brillance & shine. I would recommend this necklace to anyone that doesn't want to pay the high price of a 24" gold necklace, you won't be disappointed. <end>  Sterling Silver Necklace  Received item very quickly and it is beautiful! Definitely would order from this vendor again in the future. <end>  recommend the silver necklass  The necklass was better than expected. Price was very, very reasonable. Arrived quickly. Very pleased. <end>  Wonderful necklace  All I can really say is that this is a very nice Sterling Silver chain. It has a nice weight to it. If your considering buying this item you will not be disappointed. <end>  Rope chain  Was very pleased to recieve this Beautiful rope chain at first.I ordered this chain for a friend, replacing a much thinner chain which always got tangled. Unfortunately he started getting a bad rash around his neck from this chain after a few weeks use.Be careful. <end>  Great price, great product, friendly customer service  I have been delighted with all of the lovely silver chains I have purchased from Gem Ave. Out of 6-8 ordered, only this chain arrived with 2 or 3 chinks. I called the company and the chain was replaced within 3 days without any hassles. The new chain was strong with a secure Italian lobster clasp. It had a lovely shine, without being "glaring" and artificial looking. It came in a small, wrappable gift box and will make a wonderful present paired with the silver pendant I have in mind. If it was possible to give a four and a half star rating on this product, I would have done it! <end>  Hey ! It's a nice Chain,  The title says it all. I bought this chain to display many silver based pendants I have collected over the years. The rope necklace was worth the price & then some ! <end>  A Very Pretty Chain Necklace  The necklace is a very pretty piece. It is great for pendants. Also, I really appreciate the quick shipping - I was able to wear the chain/necklace right away!! Thank you. <end>  Feels cheap  It's okay, have worn it a few times and it looks okay but it is so lightweight... not a great buy even at this price. <end>
 B000F2ALMA  Duragold 14k Yellow Gold Teddy Bear Charm ||	  Cute!  Just as pictured. Bought it as a small pendant for my 11-year-old. Well made, not flimsy at all. <end>  Great Gift  Great inexpensive gift for little girl or teddy lover. Small, but a solid piece of jewelry that doesn't bend easy. <end>  CUTE  SINCE I BOUGHT IT FOR MY 4 YRS OLD PRINCESS, THIS BEAR IT'S JUST CUTE AND ADORABLE...IT LOOKS GREAT ON HER, BUT FOR ADULTS IT'S WAYYYYYYY TO SMALL!!BUY IT FOR KIDS AND YOU WON'T REGRET. <end>  Great Value  I was a bit uneasy about buying a piece of jewelry with just looking at a picture. My brother ended up buying it for me for my birthday. It is true that it is a little small but I love it. I highly recomend it. It is a nice piece that looks just as good as the charms I priced elsewhere that cost upwards of three hundred dollars. This charm turned out to be exactly what I wanted and I love it! <end>
 B000F2ALOS  14k Yellow and Rose Gold Turtle Charm ||	  Too Cute Turtle  I bought this for a friend who raises turtles. She and I were both very impressed with the quality of this little guy. It's a steal at that price, too. <end>  Very cute  This turtle is articulated. It's very cute on a necklace. Would not work on a charm bracelet. <end>  Gorgeous Charm - Amazing Price!  Amazing find! The charm is as adorable in person! Out of this world pricing! I was a little concerned about using it on a charm bracelett, as it seems a little dainty. Alas the gal who's present it was, was not concerned about that at all!Way to go! <end>
 B000F2K3T6  Green Jade and Mother Of Pearl Large Yin Yang Pendant, 14k Gold ||	  Great product - slow service-arrived later than promised  The product itself is beautiful.The product arrived 5 days late, was not shipped until the predicted arrival date and the company was not very responsive to the first few e-mail.Turns out they were attending a jewelry show with limited access to e-mail. They provided a reasonable explanation for the delay in shipping, offered a complete return if not satisfied with the product and ultimately refunded the shipping charges.Overall rating would be good on the service albeit slow.If you are ordering from this company, give yourself 2 weeks padding and you'll be more than happy. <end>
 B000F3HGLS  Amazon.com  Necklace Sabre Tooth (As Shown;One Size)  Clothing ||	  Had no other choice  This necklace arrived broken, but I did not have time to return it for a new one (it was for a Halloween costume). It served it's purpose, but definitely is not a well made product. <end>
 B000F3JMOM  Peridot earrings, 'Exotic Butterfly' 1" W 1" L ||	  Beautiful Earrings  These are beautiful earrings. I bought many of these Novica Collection Butterfly Earrings in different colors and they are all very well hand crafted and gorgeous. <end>
 B000F3KR9G  Quartz earrings, 'Dark Exotic Butterfly' 1.2" W 1.2" L ||	  Beautiful Earrings  These are gorgeous! Very well hand crafted! I bought many different colors of these Novica Collection Butterfly Earrings and they are all beautiful. <end>
 B000F3O8WI  14k Yellow Gold Pink Enamel Children's Turtle Earrings ||	  Description does not indicate actual size  The earrings are great  cute and exactly what they said they would be. "Problem" is not actually with the product but with the description. No where does it tell you the actual size. The picture leads you to believe they are much bigger than they actually are (about 1/2 cm from head to tail of the turtle.)Not really a problem, the actual size just needs to be on the description somewhere. <end>  Cute, but the backs fall off.  The backs aren't easy to put on, and they come off rather easily, too. <end>  Best earrings ever!  These are the absolute BEST earrings I have ever purchased for my children. My baby/toddler used to take off her earrings EVERY DAY, but not these! She leaves them on. They are great because I just put them on and forget about them. No need to fuss with them at all. I can't say it enough how glad I am that I finally found some earrings that she cannot loose the back. <end>  Cute little earrings.  I purchased these for my goddaughter. They are very cute, but she lost one inspite of the screw back. I'd buy them again though, when she's a little older and can hold on to her jewelry a bit better. <end>  tiny tots toy turtle  Here is an example of the deception of photos on the net. The smallest photo they showed of these earings was 4x larger than the actual product!!We had to put them on our 9 month old grandaughter, and even then they still appeared tiny on her baby ears!! Rip off, never buy jewlery from amazon again!! <end>
 B000F3O8XM  14k Yellow Gold Round St. Michael Medal ||	  Beautiful pendant  It's a beautiful pendant. It's about size of a dime and not thin.It's perfect size for young children. I am happy with the purchase. <end>
 B000F3Q2VS  14k Yellow Gold Pink Enamel Butterfly Earrings ||	  Great For Little Ears!!!  I ordered these for my 18 month old daughter, and was a little nervous, I had never bought earrings on line before, I wanted something with the safety backs, but I had expereince with some backs that "screw themselves off". I loved the butterflies and wanted to try them! My daughter has had them in her ears for a few weeks now and we haven't had any problems! I keep checking the backs and they are on nice and tight. I wanted a good quality earring so she didn't have problems with infections...and we havent! I will definately order from here again! <end>
 B000F3Q2YA  14k Yellow Gold Whale Charm ||	  Ahoy!  Very nice charm. maybe over-priced. I'm wearing it as a pendant. I like its "smile." <end>
 B000F3S7WA  14k Yellow Gold 3mm Mesh Hoop Earrings ||	  gold earrings  Very happy with my purchase of the gold hoop earrings. Quality is very good as always <end>  Mesh Hoop Earrings  The quality is excellent! They are very beautiful and I have already received many compliments on these earrings.If they are available in white gold, I will purchase them as well. <end>
 B000F3V9WU  14k Yellow Gold Round Confirmation Medal ||	  great  I loved it... it was much better and bigger than what i thought... and the recipient loved it too... i got the back engraved for the special occasion. <end>
 B000F3V9YI  14k White Gold Dolphin Charm ||	  Happy with this little dolphin  I like the design. It's very cute. If it could be a little bigger, I would be even happier. <end>  Very charming!  My daughters love their new dolphin charm. It's very well crafted and will help us remember our Sea World visits in 2009. <end>
 B000F3V9YS  14k Yellow Gold Italian Horn Charm ||	  old Horn Charm  When I was looking for a gold charm at a good price,. It was better than I expected it to be. <end>  The description was misleading  On the specs it said the charm was 1 inch long... It however was not, with the oval clasp which was almost a third of the size of the horn it barely made one inch. It is also very light... I was under the impression that it was solid gold... It however was hollow, and you could see the seams on the side... Also, right after the purchase, I went online because I wanted to review it and it was $10.00 cheaper... So I contacted Amazon for a sales adjustment, and they said they couldn't because I got &#34;the last of the old shipment, now there was a new shipment...&#34; So they gave me an $8.00 credit to use some where on their site. I didn't waste the time in returning because it was a Christmas present and if I would have done that there's no way I would have gotten my refund and a new charm by the time Christmas rolled around. Overall, I'm disappointed in the quality. <end>  Small but pleasant.  It's smaller than you might think, however, still very good. I would not hesitate to buy this product again. <end>  A winner  Exactly what I wanted -- small, simple, authentic, and well made. I wear it 24/7 for some very personal reasons and it shows no signs of wear. <end>  another deception  again, this is way smaller than it shows on the picture. Baby size, not for an adult. Pictures from this store are deceptive. Tiny <end>  Gold Horn  Perfect gift for my 13 year old daughter. Looks great with her rope chain. Can't beat the price and quality. <end>  Highly Recommend- Quality Cornicello  I am extremely pleased with this horn; the recipient still receives compliments on it daily. It looks and feels like it should cost 3 times what I paid. The description is accurate in size, weight and color. The gold tone is very warm and shiny and perfectly matches the chain I purchased separately. I could not be happier with the size; it is large enough for an adult to wear everyday, but not so large that it looks overwhelming. She wears it with a gold crucifix and it exactly matches in size, color and quality. The horn came in a nice jewelry box and inside a small blue bag with an impressive &#8220;Made in Italy 14K&#8221; jewelry tag attached. I actually ended up using these for the gift box because they were much nicer than the other necklace box I originally intended to wrap. I was offered overnight shipping at checkout and the item arrived at my house the following day, which worked out perfectly. I would definitely purchase this item again and would recommend others to buy it. <end>  Italian Horn  This piece is beautiful!!! Exactly as described and a perfect size. I have seeb other Italian Horns, however this was by far the best. Extremely satisfied with product and will recommend/ purchase additional charms.... <end>  great quality jewelry  I had several people comment on my Italian Horn already. I have mostly on seen men wearing them, but the size I bought is perfect for a woman. <end>  Italian Horn  The piece came 1 day earlier than expected and I am extremely pleased with the piece. The quality and size is excellent and was made in Italy it doesn't get any better than that. Even the packaging was impressive. Well worth the $46.00 I highly recommend this piece of jewelry. <end>  Nice Piece for a Good Price  I'm not sure why there are negative reviews about the size. The description clearly says 1 inch in length, and that's just how big it is. It measures 1 inch total length including the bail connector. As shown in the picture, the bail is stamped 14KT on one side and Italy on the other. It looks nice and shines well. I have a feeling that the piece is hollow, as there appears to be "seams" along the sides, and it would explain the relatively low listed weight (.6 grams). It isn't really a problem since the seams aren't terribly noticeable and the weight is accurate (weighed mine out), but I think it should be stated somewhere. My only other issue is that it didnt ship in the "Regal Blue Sueded-Cloth Pouch" like the description says, mine came in nothing more than one of those little plastic baggies. Not a big deal since I'm going to be wearing it, but the nice bag would have been handy for storing some other jewelry in. Overall its a very nice piece, and you really cant beat the price. <end>
 B000F3VA10  Duragold 14k Yellow Gold Oval Mesh Hoop Earrings (0.6" Diameter) ||	  excelent  I m very happy to buy in amazon , shipping was perfect and on time. <end>  14k gold mash hoop earrings  Extremely small, I think the measurement what is given is off. Small and very thin. It looks nice if you don't mind to have a very small earring on. <end>  Tiny  These earrings are very small. I guess there was a description or measurement somewhere but I was disappointed and do not wear them due to the very small size (length). <end>  Perfect for everyday wear!  I was looking for small comfortable hoops that snapped securely so I wouldn't lose them. Even comfortable enough to sleep wearing these earrings. These earrings met every expectation. <end>  it's okay  way toooooo small !!!!!i was looking for something biggerso i gave it to my little sister .... . <end>  lauraf  I just received these earrings . They are just like the picture. They are smaller than what I imagined but I am still pleased. They are very light and you don't even know you are wearing them. I like the clasping mechanism on them and feel secure that they won't come undone. Great price. Received really quick even in the midst of xmas!! I would definately recommend them for someone who wants subtle gold earring. <end>  a bit small, but nicely done  The quality seems to be high; and the filigree pattern is very attractive. Whlle they do seem a bit small, they look very good on my wife who received them as a gift. She was very pleased with their look and quality. <end>  Perfect gift!!  It was my sister's birthday gift. She was satisfied. That was great. I'm always impressed about the quality of global services in Amazon. Ever I can trust them. Thanks. <end>  Duragold 14K Oval Earrings  The texture on these earrings gives them a beautiful sparkle. The clasp seems very sturdy, which is something I always look for. Overall, they seem to be a well made pair of earrings at a reasonable price. <end>  Unique style  These are small in size but overall a great value. Italian gold, great gift for the woman in your life. <end>  not as large as shown  The earring were much smaller than shown and now I can't give them to my Aunt as the gift I had intended. <end>  Simple yet special earrings  These earrings are subtle and dainty yet I I am complimented everytime I wear them. They are very light and so easy to wear that I have accidentally slept in them (without my noticing nor the earrings falling out over night).The locking mechanism at the back closes with a bit of a tug, which made me worry that I would bend the earrings, but I have not noticed any damage despite my fears.All in all, great earrings for the price. <end>  fabulous  I don't wear much gold. On those occasions where you truly need the gold, these are wonderful. Description was right on. They are neither too big or too small, the perfect earring <end>  How to be sure these are the size you want.  Step 1. Get out a 6 or 12-inch ruler.Step 2. Look at it. On one side it will measure inches. On the other side it will measure millimeters ("MM" or "METRIC").Step 3. Check the product description against your ruler (both diameter and width).Step 4. If necessary, compare the measurements to earrings you already own, to get a better 3-D feel for the size.Step 5. Decide whether the earrings are too small BEFORE you purchase. <end>  perfect  exactly what my sister wanted. I could tell she wasn't excited at Christmas when she received the large Lenox serving dish gift. These earings made her happy. <end>  Affordable and my wife likes them  She likes them. I got a big smile from her, for just a loving thought and a few bucks, and the ease of Amazon shopping. I think they were a great deal. <end>  very cute and alittle different hoop earrings  these are very cute earrings, the woman I bought them for really liked them, they're a somewhat different spin on the traditional hoop earring. <end>  Nice Earrings  These Earrings are great. The only critisim I have was they were smaller than I expected from viewing their picture. <end>  Hello  Great with jeans or that little black dress. Perfect for travel. That easy go to piece of jewelry that goes with all. <end>  Nice but small  They were smaller than I expected. They are still nice and will make a nice gift, but I am slightly disappointed. <end>  Good for everyday wear.  I purchased these because I lost my favorite 14K gold pair. These turned out to be smaller than I expected, but they stay on securely and are good for travel. They fit the bill for what I needed and I don't worry so much about losing them. <end>
 B000F41C12  8mm Sterling Silver Ball Stud Earrings ||	  quality at a great price  I am particular about how much I pay for things and when a company thinks I should buy a pair of stud earrings at a price almost identical to the necklace they sold me, I look elsewhere. That is exactly what I did when I purchased these silver earrings. They (and the smaller sized ones I bought at the same time) are a prefect match to the graduated sized silver necklace I bought on line. Sabrina Silver gave me what I wanted! <end>
 B000F5BJBE  Long Sterling Silver Light Rose Pink Crystal Straight Threader Needleback Dangle Earrings ||	  nicely made jewelry  This is a quality pair of earrings and they look good too. The pink stones are good quality. They are easy to install on ears. <end>
 B000F5CXTG  Domed Sterling Silver Filigree Ring with 18K Gold Overlay Size 7 ||	  Domed Silver Ring Review  This ring was truely beautiful. It arrived very well packaged and in perfect condition. I would recommend this product and this company. <end>  Much lovelier in person  This ring is is absolutely beautiful. The intricate lacework makes it look delicate, but it's very sturdy. As it only comes in a size 7, I like to wear the ring on my thumb and it fits perfectly. It's definitely eye-catching and I receive compliments on it all the time, certainly worth twice it's actual price. <end>
 B000F5NNA4  Sterling Silver Italian Spiral Round Omega Neck Wire Choker Nickel Free 1mm round, sizes 16 - 20 inch ||	  This is NOT a regular chain.  The item is of good quality. However the picture shows a straight normal chain, but it is actually more of a rigid choker type necklace. The picture should be more representative of the item.In all fairness the description does say &#34;Wire Choker&#34; but that meant nothing to me until I received it and saw it myself. <end>
 B000F5XMEG  Bioplast Glacier Glow In The Dark Belly Ring ||	  A good purchase  The item shipped fast. It doesn't glow in the dark for very long, but it is worth it. The balls are unscrewable so I can use it with other pieces too. Its very comfortable and fits perfectly. It is easy to clean and I found it much better for the healing time then the metal rings. <end>
 B000F5XMH8  Bioplast Cool Clear Belly Ring ||	  Love it!  I'm using this for an initial piercing and it was easy (relatively, lol) to put in. I love it and you can tell when you need to clean it because it's clear. I love it  ) <end>  Perfect and barely noticeable!  This clear ring is the perfect size and is flexible and doesn't rub or get caught on clothing. If you sometimes want to make your piercing less noticeable, buy this! I didn't know what to expect buying body jewelry online but everything I ordered arrived quickly and is great quality! <end>  I love this one!  I'm a fan of bioplast since the first time I wore one of these! They feel great, and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape, convenience (no pain, no sticking to clothes, no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning), and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! I like this one because it is hardly noticeable so I can wear it when discretion is necessary, like when I'm around conservative grandparents or in other cases when a 'flashy' belly ring does not seem appropriate. And, it feels to me like something Cindarella would wear, so it gives me a fairy-tale-princess-luxurious thrill as well  -) <end>  Comfy and Clear  I love the flexibility of this navel ring. Very nice and handy to have around. I've never had an issue with Body Candy as a seller. The one time I received an imperfect item, they shipped me out a replacement ASAP. <end>  Okay  When I got it, the top ball was a different color than the rest of the ring and had glitter in it. Defeats the purpose of being clear. <end>
 B000F5XRGY  Bioplast Pink Glitter Circular Horse Shoe ||	  More of a watermelon pink  The ring is more hot pink in person and the balls are more of a watermelon pink-red, not light pink like in the picture. It's still a pretty ring, and the sparkles catch your eye in the right light. <end>
 B000F60XNS  Bioplast Disco Ball Belly Ring ||	  Beautiful and Discrete  This is an exquisit product! It's so cute and fits so nicely - 10mm length is perfect for me, some belly rings are just too long. I love the bioplast products, they are soft(er), warm against the skin and comfortable, you almost forget they're there. I got a bunch of them in different colors and I change them according to my mood and outfit. I'd give them six stars if I could! <end>  Perfect.  I believe this is actually saving my daughter's piercing. Her body rejects just about everything, and she even reacted negatively to titanium. Her original piercing migrated a lot, leaving the holes large and the flap of skin small. This is short enough to look good. If you are rejecting metals, I would definitely recommend bioplast. <end>  cute  its what i wanted  ) but its not my favorite piercing of mine but i have to wear the bioplast cuz i break out with certain metals <end>  Comfortable  This material is perfect for everyday use. It is wonderful. It even looks pretty too. I would recommend this product. <end>
 B000F612II  Bioplast Black Red Hearts Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  very comfortable  I love this material. It is nice having something that won't hurt your teeth. The fact that it is flexible makes it quite comfortable in your tounge. Love the design <end>
 B000F62S86  Bioplast Lime Blue Marracas Belly Ring ||	  Saved my belly piercing  I love this product. It saved my belly piercing because I was having an allergic reaction to surgical steel. If anyone has the same problem I truly think you should buy this. I currently still have this ring in an its been 7 months since I bought it. I would buy another one if this one is to break. <end>
 B000F64NTI  Bioplast Pink Glitter Belly Ring ||	  Pink Belly Ring  I love my new belly ring! It is bright, pink and very sparkly - just like the picture. I really like the flexibility of the material (I've only ever had metal rings before this one) so far, I am digging it. It shipped quickly and the packaging kept it very safe and sound during its travels. Well done! <end>  good price,kinda  can get a 4 pack of these and see them in person on spencers for a similar price after tax and shipping.. but its still fine. Moves and bends well, came quickly to my house which was nice. But pink was more of a yellow pink,but still cute enough too wear when doin some extra moving. I'm pleased with his buy, and may recommend to friends. <end>  Cute!  I'm a fan of bioplast since the first time I wore one of these! They feel great, and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape, convenience (no pain, no sticking to clothes, no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning), and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! This one has some bling to it which makes it a little more playful and even cuter! Love love love it! <end>  Perfect!  Comfy, girly, and affordable - this belly ring is perfect! The pink glitter is very pretty. <end>
 B000F64NWA  BIOPLAST Still Waters Belly Ring ||	  Cheap  I think this fell apart within a day. I thought it would be a good idea, and I think it looks cool, but it is plastic and it doesn't stay together well so it just fell out too quickly. Seller is good, just this particular product is cheap. Thanks! <end>
 B000F64TGA  BIOPLAST Cool Clear Eyebrow Ring ||	  Its alright...  I purchase this as a retainer for work. The ends seem very big to me and catch light very easily. While I do like wearing it as a retainer, I'm not sure it would work for someone else. There aren't many people where I work that would notice and say anything. A smaller ended one would be nice but this is working for now. <end>
 B000F69VPO  Southwestern Style Three Dimensional Wolf Head Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay Wolf Paw Prints for Men or Women, Sizes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, #11874 ||	  Seems Like a One-of-a-Kind Ring  This wolf ring is as beautiful in RL as it is in the pictures. Artfully crafted, of sound design. This ring is unlike any ring I've seen before, very unique. The band is thick enough that I need not worry that it will split from wear. The turquoise paws on either side of the wolf are a brilliant accent to the handsome wolf head. I have a deep passion for wolves and it has been difficult to find jewelry that reflects the beauty and strength of the wolf--this ring does that and more... <end>  Beautiful Wolf Ring!  I was afraid the chip inlay would pop out but after many unfortunate falls it is still in great condition.Looks Goooooood!Ahhwwooooooooooooo!!!! <end>  Wolf Ring with turquiose paws inlay  This ring is fantastic. Hgh quality, bright sterling silver. I got it for my friend who loves wolves and turquoise, he had a wolf ring and lost it. This was a Christmas present to replace it. <end>  Great!!  Fits my budget and looks really good! I did dip my hand in bleach water and it discolored my ring. I cleaned it up with a soft cloth and toothpaste then dried it with a dry soft cloth rubbing in one direction only and it shined back up. I was afraid I'd ruined it. Good looking ring!!! <end>  Quality-Comfort  I got a fairly accurate picture of the ring from other reviewers, so ordered, and was not disappointed. It came securely packaged in a plasticized water protective envelope (as evidenced having spent the day and night out in my yard- my big Lab got hold of it ). Next day I noticed what looked like an envelope in yard, and sent my Sheltie to go get it, and its My Ring!! Still in box, in two sealed envelopes in outer package still intact!! Ring, I think, comes smaller by one size as I wear an 11 and this was a 12 but fit perfectly, so everyone be aware, and order one size larger- it can always be made smaller cheaper and easier than making it larger. The detail on the ring is nice, 3D relief of wolf head, and smoothness of inlay is professional quality, real nice! Thanks Taos, I'd order again-someday.. Shipping was fast too. <end>  Fantastic 3D Realism  From the turquoise paw prints to the 3D Wolf, there is not one thing that is not beautiful. I put this sterling ring on and have not taken it off. The compliments on it's beauty and uniqueness are common. <end>  Great product  I was very impressed with the quick shipment and the quality of the product. I would highly recommend this seller to anyone that is looking for sterling silver rings or earring.Thanks for the prompt shipment. <end>  Wolf head ring  This is a beautiful ring. I bought it for my wife for Christmas, and she loves it. It seems to run about 1/2 to 1 size smaller than her other rings. <end>  Great Item  This is a really great ring. And with the price of silver at the moment it was a bargain. Quick delivery and response when I contacted the seller with a question. Will probably place additional orders in the near future. Thanks. <end>  As advertised  This ring is exactly as described and fits perfectly. The delivery was rapid and complete.Excellent vendor <end>
 B000F69VR2  Southwestern Style Chevron Band Ring with Turquoise Chip Inlay and Sterling Silver for Men or Women, Size 8, #1775 ||	  Soooo Happy!!!  These rings are beautiful. Excellent quality. I was absolutely thrilled when I received them. They were packaged securely and delivered sooner than expected. All in all, a wonderful experience! My parents love, love, love their 50th anniversary gifts!! Thank you. <end>
 B000F6E50K  Pretend and Play School Teacher Supplies ||	  Hours of fun  My niece loved it, loved it... )They all spent hours pretending to be in the classroom! I am going to order a set for my daughter! <end>  fun  My daughter loves to play school in the basement, she has had a great time with these supplies. They are fun to hand out. <end>  Daughter loves these!  Glad to see there are refills available for this product. We ordered the pretend and play school set for our six year old daughter for Christmas and she loves playing teacher! It has all the things that are in her Kindergarten classroom at school. Double bonus because it's fun AND educational! <end>  makenna  very satisfied with this product & with my granddaughter's reaction to it. I would deal with this company again. It arrived early also. <end>  Great Accessory  This set is a great accesory to the Learning Resources School Kit. Normally when something comes with a set number of papers for something they are tentative to use them afraid they'll run out. We bought this in addition to the School Kit so knowing they have so many extras they are having a ton of fun! I do think the workseet pages are kinda unuseable because the whole pad is the same page, nothing new. <end>  Fun Pretend Play for our Future Little Teachers  My daughter loves pretending she is a teacher. She is 6 and this is a favorite play date activity. It is well made and offers lots of things to school on. Highly recommend. I would suggest ordering dry erase markers to go along as they are not included. <end>  A gift for granddaughter  Gave this to my granddaughter for her Birthday. She had a ball being the teacher and her little friend the student. It arrived very quickly after I ordered it and in very good shape. <end>  Good...a lot of fun...I hope.  My granddaughter is 7 years old and loves school. I put together a large box of "teaching supplies" for her for Christmas which I'm sure she's going to LOVE!! <end>  School is IN!  The product arrived quickly and in great condition. It looks better than I expected. Playing School is so much more real! <end>  My child's dream  I bought this as a part of my child's christmas present. She loves playing teacher and I am sure this will make it more fun! <end>  high cost for bunch of paper  pricey for a bunch of paper. it comes in a card box although nice bright colors i could've printed out most of the stuff on my own computer <end>  Great accessories!  I gave these to my daughter to go with the larger kit so she wouldn't run out. She has had fun playing teacher! <end>  cool  kid loved it and has been playing school every night since getting it bang for your buck will buy again <end>  Pretend and Play School  This is a wonderful product. I got it for an 8 year old for Christmas and she loves it as well as her 4 year old sister. I think a school age child would benefit from this product the most because of the different items within the box. However it would be a great teaching tool for pre-schooler's. I am a retired teacher and I am totally impressed with this product. My girls 4 and 8 love it ! <end>  Nice refill assortment  My daughter (age 8) had gotten the school set last year and ran out of the report cards, hall passes, stickers etc. This is a nice refill assortment and she was very happy to get it! <end>  Pretend and Play  Product was exactly what I expected. It arrived on time and in great condition. I was happy with this purchase and my daugther is looking forward to playing with her new school supplies. <end>  supplies for the teacher set  Really a must have if you buy the teacher set as they use them up pretty quickly playing school. Everyone thought this was the perfect gift and were impressed with the amount of things you could do with it. My 7 year old grand daughter was delighted! <end>  My Grandaugters Love It  I bought this along with another "play school" set and my granddaughters (ages 3 1/2 and 5) are always asking to play with it. <end>  Great purchase  Bought this set for my Granddaughter who is 9. She loves it and plays with the set all the time. <end>  My 7 year old daughter LOVES this!  I bought this product for my 7 year old daughter who loves to play school. She loves this! All of her friends love it too! <end>  My 8yr old neice will love this for playing school!!  My 8yr old neice always loves to play school, but we always have to make things to play with. She will love these pretend teacher supplies since she is always the teacher, of course  ) <end>  granddaughter loves it  bought her teacher-related supplies for Christmas, ordered online and this arrived at their house right away. She is thrilled with playing teacher and these products are great for her. <end>  not much in the package  I thought these cards would have a plastic coating on them so they could be written on multiple times. They are just paper! They are kind of small. For the price, I could have just gone to the dollar store! That's what I'll do next time! <end>  Pretend teaching  I actually purchased this for my 4 & 5 year-old granddaughters; however, when my 9 year-old grandson saw it, he immediately went into the teacher mode and the 2 girls fell right in line playing the parts of students. Very cute <end>  Gift so I can't answer all the questions....  The product(s) I ordered were, of course, a gift for a small person. They appear to be well made and durable and I'm certain the child will be happy with her presents. I would order from this company again, for certain. Items were well packaged and arrived in due time. <end>  let's play school  I bought this for my great nephew. He has two younger sisters and he always thinks he has to teach them what to do. He will probably love the report card and give them bad grades. Thanks <end>  Good for playing school  I enjoy this toy for my daughter. She likes playing with the maps and learning the different states. My biggest complaint about this toy is that the refills for the activities are the same as the ones it came with. I wish they would change the lessons to make it different each time. Also, our clock "tower" broke a little the first couple times she used it and we had to tape it. Other than those couple things, my daughter enjoys it! <end>  Kids Play Teacher supplies  My daughter loves to play school and this has really helped her. She enjoys giving her sister's report cards and stickers for doing well. They make her feel like a real teacher. <end>  Pretend School Teacher Supplies  My daughter loves to play school so it was important to have the extra supplies to her. I would buy this again. <end>  great toy to play school with...  My 10 year old loves to play school and the supplies in this kit are perfect to add to her pretend school. <end>  great gift  When my daughter opened this gift she was so excited because she wanted it so bad. She is always playing school so while pretending to be a teacher she is also learning herself. <end>  a christmas gift  Pretend and Play School Seta gift to my 5 year old granddaughter for christmas 2008. she loves it and plays with it all the time very educational. also have the supplies that i ordered extra and stamp set....i give it a 5 star toy. <end>  perfect for my 8 year old!  My daughter received this for christmas and has had a great time playing school with her brothers, friends and even her dolls. Comes with everything you would need to play including grade cards! <end>  Excellent gift  My 6 year old daughter has not stopped playing with this since Santa left it for her on December 25th. It is a great gift. <end>  Perfect for pretenders  My 8 year old loves this. She likes to pretend she is a teacher. She got these for christmas and hasn't stopped with them yet. <end>  school teacher play  Great idea for pretend teacher play. I thought that the cards would be a little bigger,and that it would be more durable. Overall not bad though. <end>  Absolutely wonderful!!!  I bought this for my niece who was turning 7 and she LOVES it. My 9 year old son wants one now also!!! <end>  Great gift  I purchased this for my nine-year-old granddaughter who loves to play school. She was thrilled with the materials that she could add to her classroom! <end>  School's In  The kit is a self-contained folder with many school supplies that the children can use including even a school bell. Add on the kit with extra pieces & the school is complete. My grandkids spend much time playing school with this kit. <end>  Great pretend school set!  My 8 year old daughter, who loves to play school, absolutely loves this set. It has multiple copies of school papers and they are a smaller size, good for use with dolls as the students! <end>
 B000F6PICY  I Heart my Family Laser Etched Italian Charm ||	  Wonderful  Everything the picture said it would be. It came quickly and was exactly what I thought it would be. Thanks! <end>
 B000F6RFSY  I Heart my Niece Laser Etched Italian Charm ||	  Christmas Pressie  I bought this and an italian charm bracelet for my niece as a Christmas present and she loves it! I loved the inscription on the back, didn't realize it had that but it conveyed my love for my favorite lil' girl perfectly! Will definitely be buying from you guys again as I intend to get her a different charm for each birthday and christmas! <end>
 B000F6UXF6  Belle Full Body Beauty and the Beast Disney Italian Charm ||	  Pretty, but snags  I bought this item several years ago now, and although I have a serious Belle obsession, this piece was not used for long.The dress and hair cause a point and depending on which way they are pointing, can snag on clothing or even worse, scratch children. I worked in childcare at the time and left a nice scratch on a 9 month old baby I was watching. It is beautiful though, and I take it off and put it back on the bracelet when I want to wear it for certain events but even that becomes a hassle sometimes.Good quality but maybe not worth it depending on atmosphere. <end>
 B000F6WS72  Tigger Full Body Winnie The Pooh Disney Italian Charm ||	  Very nice, but tail catches  I love this charm, but unfortunately I have found the tail continues to snag on almost everything I wear. I fear the tail will eventually break off due to the amount of times it has snagged on fabric and me having to bend it back into place. Otherwise, the charm is beautiful...just beware of the tail! <end>  Tigger Italian Charm  I have to say, that I was very impressed not only with the product I received, but with the shipping timeline and also with the way the product was sent. This was exactly as I'd pictured it on Amazon.com, and delivery was much sooner than I'd expected. Delivery was expected to be between 12/18-12/26, and I received the product on 12/20, which was before Christmas. It was nicely and securely packaged, and the product lived up to my expectations. I would DEFINITELY buy from this vendor again, and I was very satisfied with my overall experience with them! <end>
 B000F74N6A  Loving Family&reg 14k Gold Pendant - Mother and 3 Children ||	  Great!  This was a mother's day gift to my mom, and she cried when she got it. The necklace that comes with the pendant is garbage, so i would recomemnd replacing that when you get it. She has had it since may and wears it everyday. There is no discoloration or anything. It still looks brand new. <end>
 B000F791EY  Zina Sterling Silver Double Flower Drop Earrings ||	  Beautiful,beautiful,beautiful!  These earrings are simple yet elegant! They give me a polished look. I do not have to wear a necklace with these. They are complete in themselves. I wear these one day and then the hooped Swirl Collections earrings I ordered at the same time the next day. I ordered these when they were on sale for $29. They are worth the regular price but wait for a sale and you will be glad you did. <end>  Silver earrings  These double flower sterling silver drop earrings are beautiful! They happen to match a necklace that I qwn. I now wear them all the time! <end>
 B000F791FI  Zina Sterling Silver And Amethyst Swirl Flower Pendant, 18" ||	  Great!  I absolutely love this necklace, and was a reasonable price. I have had many compliments. The information given was accurate. <end>
 B000F7B23M  14K White Gold Diamond Circle Pin ||	  Joke  Much,Much,Much smaller than the picture. Looks like it came out of a gumball machine! I've seen better looking costume jewelry at Wal-Mart. I would be ashamed to give it to my wife for Xmas. Actual value is probably $1.98. What a chump I am, just spent $200.00 on junk. <end>
 B000F7DJK6  Sterling Silver Hana Design Square Earrings by Zina ||	  one of my favorites  I love the size, weight and look of these earrings. The sale price (60% off) was just icing on the cake. I think they are too dressy for everyday, but when I do wear them, I just feel a little more elegant. <end>  clean look  Nice design with lots of detail. Not a stamped design. I would have bought 6 more pairs for relatives if they weren't so much. <end>  Just beautiful  This is the third pair of earings yb Zina that I have purchased. I love them all but these are stunning in their simplicity. The size is nice and they are very well constructed. <end>
 B000F7FNMS  Zina Sterling Silver "Signature Swirl" Pendant With Round Blue Topaz On 17" Woven Chain ||	  Very pretty pendant  This is a very pretty pendant, with a great design. It is dainty and small, and my 2 year old loves wearing it often. Its nicely made with no sharp edges. The topaz has a good shine to it, and the chain is amazing. It is a very sturdy rolo chain. <end>  Mom Loves It  I bought this for my mom for Mother's day. She absolutly loves it. I didn't find it "large" "gaudy" or cheap looking. The chain is sturdy. We both like the way it passes through the back of the pendant. We got a 30% off deal on the regular price. Not sure I would have paid full price for it. <end>  way too large  i ordered this necklace thinking that it would be small and dainty. it is actually quite large and cheap looking. i was really disappointed <end>
 B000F7HGN2  Sterling Silver Rectangular Black Onyx Clip On Earrings ||	  beautiful and comfoftable  These are really pretty earrings. They are jewelry not just cheap junk. They are very light weight and the clips are greaT, they stay on without pinching. I can wear them all day and forget that they are on. These were well worth the price which I consider a bargin. <end>
 B000F7OYPK  Burnished Silver CHIC FILIGREE CHANDELIER Earrings ||	  too heavy-don't buy  I had no idea now huge these earrings were. I have never worn earrings that weighed this much and am going to try to return them. They are huge, not fashionable and heavy. Don't buy! <end>
 B000F7P1TS  Godinger Silver-Plated Jewelry Box with Rose ||	  Excellent item  I bought 11 of these cases and gave them to friends at an appreciation dinner and they loved them. They were so elegant that I am going to order one more for myself. <end>  It is an excellent item in reasonable price  It is an excellent item. The price is very reasonable. A recommanded gift for friendship. <end>  a beautiful gift  I bought this as a gift for my boss, and she was extremely pleased. It is much prettier in reality than in the pictures. Nice velvet interior. All in all, it's very elegant and classy. <end>  Beautiful  I bought it for mothers day and my mother loved it. It was a great value. And BEAUTIFUL. I almost kept it for myself. <end>  Exactly What I Needed  I have a wooden jewelry box for my older jewelry and items that aren't often worn. I bought this inexpensive little box for jewelry I wear on a regular basis. It's much prettier than expected, and the crystal rose is a nice accent. If you're looking for a nice gift -- for yourself or someone else -- please consider this! <end>  different and pretty  I have given Godinger silver as gifts before. I thought the crystal rose made this very different and would make a great gift. I might get one for myself too. <end>  Misleading Advertisement  These items (4 available) were listed as "new". When I opened the box the 4 items were mailed in, it was not well packed for such delicate items. The most distressing part though was that each individual box was marked "damaged".I would never have ordered this type of product if I had known it was "damaged", and this certainly was not indicated in the listing! <end>  Replacement Beautiful  First one arrived with rose broken in half--did not have any type of cushioning around it (manufacturer packaging error). Amazon immediately replaced it with no hassles. Have also purchased several of the matching picture frames in the past as gifts. Love the design of these products. <end>  Satisfied with replacement of this item.  The first jewelry box had a scratch on the lid. Amazon replaced it quickly. The jewelry box was given as a gift and the recipient likes it very much. <end>  Jewelry Box  When the item arrived I immediately noticed the rose bud had snapped off. I just glued it back on and all is well. I actually feel this product is nice considering it was only $20. Very nice looking and hinges operate nicely. The inside is also good. It can hold about 15 rings. The other 2/3 of the box is broken out in 1 boxed/section that is 1/3 of the total sized and the other 1/3 is split into two boxed sections. <end>  Worth the $$  It's not a bad size and the silver does not smudge as quickly as I expected it to. The flower on top is large and can get intrusive if you have a small counter when opening. Otherwise it's not for the price. <end>  Not a good product  The box was of inferior quality and was damaged on receipt. One of the "crystal" rose petals had fallen off the lid. I returned it to Amazon but have heard nothing yet. This is one of those things that "looks good on paper". <end>  Simple and Beautiful  Over the years, I have downsized my jewelry collection, keeping only those items that I consistently wear or which are meaningful to me. As such, I was looking for a jewelry box to house the few pieces I still have. I bought this for myself, and it was everything I was looking for. It's a stream-lined shape, simple, yet elegant. It would also make a very nice, yet practical gift, to store a small quantity of jewelry. <end>
 B000F7T4MS  Godinger Oblong Fluted Jewelry Box ||	  top quality, good value  a nice little gift, that has a high value, silver platted, nice design inside. I purchased 3 of them, and very happy with it. <end>  really really great!  IT was so nice and so cheap, I kept thinking that there must be somthing wrong with it, but there wasn't. A++ <end>  Beautiful!  This is a very pretty jewelry box. Perfect for my 9 year old who just got her ears pierced and needed a place to put her new earrings. <end>
 B000F88H70  Sterling Silver Multicolor Crystal Necklace Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  satisfied  excellent value jewelry. just as described. arrived exactly on the day planned despite distance. very satisfied. only point to have in mind is the purchase of a new box for nice presentation, but this depends if you want it as a gift. <end>  Necklace not as advertised  When I received this is the mail I was disappointed. It did not sparkle as my other Swarovksi pieces and the silver cheapens the look. I expected more crystals and less silver- unfortunately I did not get what was pictured. I even contacted the seller to see about returning it. The only reason I kept this over-priced piece was because I had also purchased the matching earrings and bracelet. The bracelet (the one with just crystals, no silver beads) is stunning and the earrings are decent. <end>  Beautiful for bridesmaid jewelry  Lovely necklace. Great mix of colors in shades of purple, pink and blue. My Maid of Honor loves it! <end>  Beautiful Necklace  Really pretty necklace. Very eye catching and dazzling! Better in person than the picture. Good quality. <end>  .925 Sterling Silver Multicolor Crystal 20" Necklace  I love the necklace. It is everything I thought it would be. The only drawback is the clasp. It has come loose every time I have worn it. I will have to look into changing it. Other than that, it is beautiful. <end>  Beautiful necklace.  This is a beautiful necklace and I also bought the earrings and bracelet to match. They were gifts for my daughter (who doesn't really like to wear things around her neck, she tells me). She loves the bracelet and earrings....I love the necklace, but had to return it - I wear yellow gold and had nothing to go with it. <end>  You will love it  I gifted it to my wife birthday with the set of Earring and bracelet, she loves it. And lot of people appriciated the looks. There is no doubt this is Swarovski. Buy with confidence you will love it. <end>  Another great necklace  This was the fourth piece of Swarovski jewelry bought for my wife. All have been beautiful and are loved. This is a great item to start or add to a collection of Swarovski Crystal jewelry. You can't go wrong with this necklace or vendor. <end>  Horrible quality!  My husband bought a set of this jwelry for my birthday in June and I loved it! But today I found the silver chain turns into totally BLACK! I only weared them twice for my birthay and my friend's wedding and I kept them in their little boxes very well! Only two month they become so ugly! I am very upset and I never see any jwelry has such bad quality! The whole set costs us more than hundred dollars! Feel very very BAD! <end>
 B000F8FL6K  Gold Label 2-1/2-Inch Mini Illuminated Music Box, Nativity ||	  Mini Illuminated Nativity Music Box  Enjoyed this small music box very much. It was a great addition to my miniature nativity collection. <end>  Beautiful!  A great product and a wonderful gift to give or get! The price is perfect! I have had many positive comments on this! <end>  Not worth the price  The music box was nice and it works, but the nativity looks cheap. I gave these as gifts and I was embarrassed because it looked like I bought it from the Dollar Store for $5. <end>  Perfect!  This was a Santa gift for my daughter. It was perfect. Sweet, charming and magical. It is well constructed and has a pretty sound. Even the miniature figures are painted well. <end>  Junk.  First of all, the one I received was defective. The animated scene sticks once every revolution and stops playing. It is possible to nudge it with a finger and get it going again. By nudging it along, I discovered the box's other flaw. &#34;Silent Night&#34; is horribly abbreviated and doesn't sound remotely right. If you were singing, it would be, &#34;Silent night, holy night. Sleep in heavenly peace.&#34;For $20, I didn't expect a symphony. But it isn't even worth $20.Naturally, Amazon has an excellent return policy, so I am satisfied in getting my money back. <end>  Very Nice with Lighted Manger  This little mini-music box has a lot of details including a central scene that rotates as the music plays. There is also a little illuminated manger (battery run) that goes off when the lid goes down.A cute miniature nativity scene and a short play version of Silent Night. <end>
 B000F8YJTU  Beautiful! Sterling-silver Zuni Needle Point Turquoise Dangle-earrings ||	  Nice Earrings !  (I purchased these earrings as a gift ... so I will post my review as well as that of the recipient)I have purchased 10-15 "Southwestern" style items(...earrings/rings/necklaces) over the past few years.This is my first purchase of a Rich Peel Ent. product.I liked the look, dimensions and the price(... if IMO, they were of quality craftmanship).In person, they look even better than the picture ... the size is perfect and IMO, the quality of the item is "well worth" the price.I was pleased with my purchase.The recipient liked the design, the dimensions and the lightness of the earrings.She liked the way they hung from her ear and the reflection off the silver.I will definately check Rich Peel Ent. in the future when looking for "Southwestern" jewelry.So, two people were very pleaed with the purchase of these earrings. <end>
 B000F933ZU  Rose In Heart, 14K Gold Diamond Charm ||	  Beautiful!  This charm is very beautiful. The only thing I would change would be the clasp that links the hook and the pendent together, very week. Other than that this is a great product. <end>
 B000F9344K  Star, 14K Gold Diamond Charm ||	  Nice  It arrived SUPER quick. It's a tad smaller than I thought that it would be but hey...its 14k white gold! Perfect for my charm bracelet. <end>
 B000F97APY  Southwestern Style Bear and Bear Paw Design Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, Size 11, #11115 ||	  It is a pretty ring and worth more than it sold for.  This ring arrived really quickly. It is a beautiful ring and could have easily sold for more. My husband really liked it. It was a little loose but not too bad. For the money, a high quality ring. <end>  Great value. Out standing customer service.  This ring is beautiful and well made, it is worth the price and more. I bought two rings from Taos Trading Rings and they are both really well made at a very fair price. What is better is the customer service was outstanding. In the 10 years I have used Amazon I can remember writing one other review. But my experience was so good with this company that I really wanted to spread the word and encourage you to buy from them! I am leaving this same review for the other ring I bought too. <end>  Bear Ring  this ring is beautiful and just what I was looking for. My son's highschool mascot is a bear and this ring is perfect for him. <end>
 B000F97AQ8  Southwestern Native American Style Running Wolf Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, #11108 ||	  The Wolves /ring  The rings were even nicer than appeared in the site. The tourquiose is well set and the wolves have a good "shape" to them. Was very pleased with my purchase. These are to be used as wedding bands and make very nice ones. <end>  running wolf sterling silver ring with turquoise wolves  This ring was nice quality for the money. The running wolves little smaller than I had pictured them. The ring itself is nicely cut and polished. The running wolves are accented in turquoise and detailed nicely. This ring looks sturdy enough to be worn everyday with casual attire. Ring runs small tho should have ordered a larger size fits rather tightly on my finger. Would make a nice gift for anyone who loves wolves or native american style of jewelry. Very versatile for any woman or man who wants a unique looking ring. <end>  An Eye Catcher  This ring is very special. I bought it for my husband and many people have noticed and commented on its beauty. It is such a lovely and shiny silver and the turquoise wolves make a beautiful contrast. This is a unique ring and it is interesting because of the Native American component,being that it is a story-telling ring. <end>  Great Crafstmanship  This is a great ring....and the service and delivery are first rate. I would definitely recommend this ring and Taos Trading Company to those who are looking for quality products. The staff there are great and very helpful. I will be a repeat customer. <end>  Excellent and considerate service  I got a quick response when I inquired about when a size 7 would again be available. The sales person even E-mailed me when it came in and offered to hold one for me. I also love the ring! <end>  ring  I bought this ring for my husband and it was too small for his finger so now I have one and my husband has one. he does like it a lot. <end>  wonderful ring  As an avid wolf lover this ring is perfect for me. Has a beautiful turquios inlay that is well done and as a whole has a low profile. The ring is about 1/8" thick and pretty durable. <end>  Ring  This ring is so awesome! I highly recommend this. I love wolves and it's just so beautiful. The ring sizes are not what you normally wear. This one I got bigger because I thought it would be smaller like another one I ordered but they both ended up being the opposite so just be careful when ordering the size. Luckily both fit on a finger or I would have been in trouble  -/ <end>  Lovely ring  I bought this ring for a personal significance. It's beautiful, shiny, and the little turquoise wolves are cute, nicely shaped, and pretty as well.Someone in an earlier review said that the rings run a little small. Well I didn't have that problem. I got my ring and it fits perfectly!The only downside of this ring is that I've found it turns my finger green - which means the metal contains copper. Not a big deal, but I like when my rings don't turn my fingers weird colors.Overall  5 of 5 stars for a beautiful piece of jewelry that is a work of art!Follow up  12.25.10  The ring stopped turning my finger green once I wore it for a while. So it doesn't not do that anymore. <end>  Rather disappointed  I used part of a gift card to purchase this ring. The card was a gift for my 75th birthday. It is an attractive ring, but not worth the price. It looks as if it could be purchased at a flea market for 10.00 tops. The advertising picture was better than the item. (First time this has ever happened, right???) Just sorry I used my gift money, but unfortunately, "you learn by doing.". <end>
 B000F99DV8  Pacifier, 14K Gold Diamond Charm ||	  Very Nice  Beautiful charm; very happy with it. Perfect size for my charm bracelet. Diamonds are small but sparkle nicely under the right light. I plan on purchasing more EZ charms for my bracelet.Comment on Shipping  Order was placed 1/14, but not shipped until 1/23 without any notification of delay to customer. <end>
 B000F9Y79G  10K White Gold 0.13 ct. Diamond with Alternating 0.13 ct. Emerald Anniversary Ring ||	  The wife liked it, a lot!  This ring was purchased as a gift for my ,soon to be, wife. She LOVES green so the ring was a hit with her. She is not a gemstone-type gal and I think it was her first diamond ring. She loves it and does not take it off very often. <end>
 B000FA00W8  Forzieri Crystals Round Swarovski Crystal and Sterling Silver Tennis Bracelet ||	  Stunning; picture doesn't do this justice  You can't really tell from the photo just how nice this bracelet is. In real life, it is really gorgeous. Looks like a million bucks. <end>  looks good... but..  My wife loved this when I gave it to her. it has a very nice, elegant look to it. However, the clasp broke after a few months of wearing it. <end>
 B000FA0B1I  10K White Gold Diamond Floral Cluster Earrings (1/4 cttw) ||	  Love them!  I got these from my husband for Christmas. They are beautiful! Not too small, not too big. They can be worn with everyday outfits, or with nice outfits. <end>  Meant As A Gift  Bought these to be a Communion gift for my God-Child, but they are so nice, that I will keep them and give her my more expensive diamond studs instead, since they have screw backs. Never thought I would part with my studs, but these cluster earrings are very elegant. The picture doesn't do them justice. And my niece (God-Child) can enjoy them while I am still around to see them on her. <end>

Its very shiny and sparkly and looks great with a nice chain. Great price, and the color is awesome. <end>  A lot of sparkle for a little dough!!!  I purchased this little bobble for my wife.

 B000FD9HMO  Loving Family&reg 14k Gold Pendant - Parents and Two Children ||	  love it  I love, love, love this necklace. I originally thought I wanted the mother/child pendant, but after seeing this, I fell in love. I love having my own little family and wearing this pendant represents keeping my family near, and dear to my heart.The product itself is great. I've worn it for a year now and it still looks like it did when I got it. It doesn't feel cheap. <end>  Young Moms love it.  Young Moms will love this necklace.

 B000FDCQYA  Mother and Child Diamond Solid Charm Pendant ||	  The serenity of parenthood  I've send this pendant to a friend of mine, who has a son of 2 years old.She was very impressed by the the pendant, because for her it was the emotion of the mother-child relation, brought in a minimal and sereen way.She felt the pendant to be very intimate.And of course, her son wasn't allowed to play with it, but he saw, that it was he and his Mom! <end>
 B000FDDV80  .03 cttw Fancy Yellow Diamond Swirl Circle 14k White Gold Pendant (I1 Clarity) ||	  Pendant review  This is a pretty little necklace. One problem, however, is how the chain attaches to the pendant. If the pendant falls off, it is difficult to loop the chain through the oddly placed holes. Now, it may be easier to do with younger eyes and hands that don't shake with close work, but I certainly had problems. Otherwise, the necklace is attractive and gets lots of compliments. <end>
 B000FDKIFO  Loving Family&reg 14k Gold Pendant - Parents and Child ||	  Great gift with meaning  My wife and I have one child and its hard to find a family of 3 together charm, but after hours of looking...here it is. Great gift,excellent quality. <end>  LOVING Fmily  Beautiful pendant, good quality and finish. Only wish is that is came with a bettter chain, this one is too thin. <end>  Wife loves it!  My wife finally had the one child she had prayed for and she never takes this pendant off. It is beautifully made. My only complaint is the necklace is extremely thin. <end>
 B000FEJOW6  Clearly Charming Dollar Sign Italian Charm ||	   )  I put together a lucky charm bracelet for a friend this was a perfect addition. Cute arrived on time & seems well made. She loves it <end>
 B000FEJOYY  Clearly Charming Rottweiler Italian Charm ||	  Poor Picture  I bought this charm for my daughter's bracelet. The picture on here is clear and a good representation. The charm itself is very light in color and poorly defined. A dissappointment. <end>

 B000FFN3X6  Daily Elegance - Mesh Ring ||	  May turn your finger green  I purchased this item for my sister-in-law's birthday. She picked the ring out herself. She has had it for about 6 months now. It has begun turning her finger green. I think the manufacturer needs to do a better job of coating the ring with silver. <end>
 B000FGCSUO  Rounded Trinity Knot Necklace (length  16") ||	  Love it!  Great!! I wear it everyday ) Great quality! I have had it about a year now and it still looks like it did when I bought it. <end>
 B000FGEU9G  Stallion Stable Music Box ||	  Average Level of Interest  My 4 and half year old daughter liked it for a few days and she is no longer interested in it any more. <end>  Very Nice...  I bought this for my niece for xmas.. So she hasn't gotten it yet but after opening it up and looking it over, it was nicer than I thought it was going to be. She loves horses and I'm sure that she's going to love it. <end>  Fine for what it is, but pretty cheap  To be honest, I didn't expect much given the cost, but was still disappointed to find out the box is made of cardboard (albeit very sturdy cardboard). Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it. Still, it's meant for a child which means it's not going to last forever regardless of what it's made of. <end>  Fine for horse loving kids  We purchased this for our 11-year ld (horse loving) niece and she likes it. I was disappointed that it is kind of cheap looking in real life, but she still likes it. It has lots of little compartments that she enjoys, and it suits her needs. <end>  kids' spinning horse musical jewelry box  My 7-year-old granddaughter loves this cute jewelry box; when you open the lid there is a small horse that spins around to the tune of "My Old Kentucky Home." It was advertised as playing "Home on the Range" but my granddaughter doesn't really care what tune it plays. It appears to be a sturdy little jewelry box, but I wouldn't give it to a child much younger than 7 because of the potential for breaking that delicate little horse off its spinner. <end>  cheap cheap cheap  Not what I was expecting. The tool on the back to wind it up broke in the first 2 weeks. <end>  Horse Music/Jewelry Box  http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGEU9G/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI bought this as a Christmas gift for my 10-year old granddaughter. She seemed happy with it when she opened it. For the price, I was quite impressed with it. I would recommend for anyone as a different kind of gift for a horse lover. <end>  Darling!!  Bought this music box along with the suggested stamp set and coloring book for less money than the music box alone at a tradtional retail store! My 8-year old is thrilled with all! The stamp set alone I saw in a retail store for over $20. The music box is a nice beginner jewelry box for those first higher quality jewelry pieces (i.e. sterling silver charm bracelet, gold locket etc...). The song it plays is pleasant, too. If your little girl loves horses and jewelry -what little girl doesn't- don't hestitate, suprise them with this set! <end>  Great Buy  My daughter is a big horse fan so this was a big hit. She loved it. It seems to be very well made. <end>  Horse jewelry box  This jewelry box is much heavier and nicer than I expected. Has the appearance of a high quality product. It would be great for anyone that loves horses, not just kids. It has a windup key on the outside and when you raise the lid, the spinning "ballerina" has been replaced by a little spinning horse. I got this for our 7 yr old granddaughter and she loves it. If she uses it as a jewelry box and not a toy, I have no doubt she'll be able to pass it down to her own daughter some day. Highly recommend!!! <end>  Stallion stable music box  I obtained this for my granddaughter and I know she will love it. It is gorgeous and well made and worth the money I paid. The horse picture on the music box is beautiful and bigger than I expected. I tried to do the feedback but unable to finish.I would recommend this music box to any horse lover. <end>
 B000FGEV54  Amazon.com  Jack The Dog Musical Treasure Box  Clothing ||	  sturdy first jewelry box  This little box is so cute...the little dog is adorable...it is like a ballerina box but a dog box. However, this is made from very sturdy paper board...not wood. However, for a small child...this is best...no splinters or sharp edges. <end>  Cute but VERY Fragile!!!  I ordered this for my 3 yr old son who loves his cousin's musical box. There arent very many out there for boys! He was so happy when he opened it.....but within a few hours, we discovered that the actual music piece was not even secured to the box at all, and the little spinning doggie kept getting stuck on the platform. My little boy never even wound it up...only mommy and daddy. This box is very flimsy and there are pieces inside that look like they should be glued down, but arent. What a difference in the quality of the disney boxes as compared to this one! My husband is going to try to fix it....who knows! If I knew....I would never have spent this kind of money on it! <end>  Really cute, but be careful with curious boys!  This is a great alternative for boys who, like my son, are fascinated by the ballerina in the box. But the box is made of paper and he very quickly (without abusing it) had some of the glued seams coming apart. The dog also scraped the mirror pretty bad because it didn't always stop right away when the box was closed. I wish there was something a little sturdier for boys, like the nice boxes made for girls. We'll keep looking, this box wasn't it for us... <end>  Adorable product  We bought this for my daughter's third birthday. What a sweet little music box! It is bright, colorful and sturdy. She will enjoy stashing treasures in it for years to come. <end>  Really Cute!!  This musical box is great for all kids, but especially boys. Most others feature ballerinas etc., but this is great for anyone. <end>

 B000FH6ZWU  Earrings, 'Cow in the Moon' 1.3" W 1.9" L ||	  Love These!  These earrings are wonderful; very whimsical and just the right size. I am a "cow jumped over the moon" collector and don't know that they would appeal to everybody, but to me they are pretty much perfect. They will definitely bring a smile to your face. <end>

 B000FI0YS0  Violet Heart Beaded Pendant Necklace ||	  Mixed feelings  The glass heart itself is nice, but the other beads on the necklace are really cheap looking - like the kind you imagine kids using in preschool. Still, some people have complimented me on it. It's cute in a "fun" way. <end>  Terrible waste of money  Terrible necklace. I received this product and it was terribly scratched and broke after a few days of wear. If you want a necklace, find something else. <end>
 B000FI26XG  Wire Cuff Bracelet - Silver ||	  Just Fantastic  This bracelet is very well made, fits comfortably on wrist and looks great. Great product at a great price. <end>  Pretty Bracelet, but Doesnt Open Too Wide For Wrist  I bought this for my niece for Christmas and I felt bad cause it hardly opened big enough for her wrist - I thought it would break. It ended up fitting fine, but it is just an ok product. <end>
 B000FI47V0  Dancing Flowers Blue Beaded Chandelier Earrings ||	  Rather large earrings  I purchased this as an extra gift for somebody, and the recipient loved them. When I received them in the mail though, I was a bit surprised by the size of them... They were larger than I envisioned. But they are cute and kind of funky. It depends on your taste. <end>
 B000FI5GH4  Turquoise Blue Lark Bangle Bracelet ||	  a solid piece of jewelry  what a pleasant little turquoise surprise in this solid bracelet! It wears well, and looks good on. I like it and recommend its' purchase. <end>
 B000FIAK7A  Siamese Cat Laser Italian Charm ||	  Not quite what you get  I ordered this charm because it looks like a Siamese cat, but the one I received is much less detailed. It still is obviously a cat, but did not match the picture. <end>  Nice charm  Other charms I saw of a Siamese cat were too specifically colored, and this one is perfect in conveying a simple Siamese cat. <end>
 B000FIDSEM  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 22 Inch 6.5-7mm White Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Wife Loves them!  For the price, these are very good-looking pearls. My wife can't stand choker-length or snug fitting things around her neck, and this was just the right size for her.I wish they had a little 5-second video on how to open the clasp, as it's a little tricky at first, especially with my fat fingers. You have to pinch the two tiny tabs (and nothing else) on one side of the clasp, pull on those tabs until the hook catches on the end of the clasp, and finally thread it out of the clasp to get it undone.Like I said, my wife loves them. She's worn them a couple of times already since I gave them to her on Christmas and has even bought a pair of pearl earrings to wear with the necklace. I'd call that a home run gift. <end>  Not acceptable quality  The pearls were not well strung and looked like something that could be picked up in a dimestore (if they existed anymore). I returned them. The only good thing is Amazon's excellent return policy -- easy and quick and courteous. <end>

 B000FIG0II  Rembrandt Charms Mustard Seed Charm ||	  Very nice for necklace  This was a gift and it went over very well. It is small - pay attention to the dimentions listed, but that was a good thing for a hanging neck charm in my opinion. It's almost small enough that it could be a large charm on a bracelet. It is very nice. Pretty. <end>  Good value for the price  The mustard seed charm arrived on time as scheduled. The quality is very good for the price of the item. I would order again. <end>  Faith can be fashionable!  In the Parable of the Mustard Seed, Jesus compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a mustard seed. Although having some of the smallest seeds, the mustard plant grows to a large size, providing shelter for birds  Mark 4 31-32. The story has been interpreted to mean that grand things can grow from tiny actions.Every time someone asks me about my necklace, I use that opportunity to share how my faith in God has grown over the years.

 B000FIJ8FU  I Heart the Clarinet Red Heart Laser Italian Charm ||	  Disappointed  Charm was nice but expected a charm with a loop with which to sew onto a Christmas Stocking,not a sliding charm. Too expensive both for charm and shipping. Came late, I accepted it back and just passed it around in case somebody could find a use for it...no idea whatever happened to it. <end>
 B000FIK3Z4  Rembrandt Charms Savannah Waving Girl Charm ||	  love it  I purchase charms for my bracelet for every place that I 'vacation'. I was in Savannah and could not find a charm. I looked on Amazon.com and found this one. It is perfect. <end>
 B000FIK5AM  Rembrandt Charms Madonna and Child Charm ||	  Madonna and Child  I liked the Madonna and Child, but to be honest, did not care for the other one I received. If buying a charm, stick with the disc shaped ones, they are the most attractive... <end>
 B000FIK5BQ  Rembrandt Charms Madonna and Child Charm ||	  Barely There by Precious Accents  The charm I received from PRECIOUS ACCENTS had an imprint barely visible to the human eye. Poor customer service included an abrupt response that I would not receive full credit for return of this item. I will make no further purchases from this company. Perhaps I ought to have prayed for a miracle from the "Madonna" in order to see Madonna and child more clearly. <end>

 B000FIO9MM  Rembrandt Charms Corkscrew Charm ||	  So cute!  This is a very nice, detailed 3D charm. Note that the product description says the charm moves - that's true, but only the double levers. The helix, turn handle, and other "parts" don't, as on a working corkscrew. <end>

Perfect.small and cute <end>  Just what I was looking for  I purchased the 14k gold and the sterling silver anchor charms. They are nice quality.

 B000FIPJIU  Rembrandt Charms Georgia Charm ||	  TINY charm  This charm is TINY. It seems to be well made. I bought it as a gift and was embarrassed at its size.

 B000FIPQ92  Rembrandt Charms Cat Charm ||	  Perfect Little Kitty Charm  Of all the charms I looked at ~ and there were SEVERAL ~ this was the one that made the cut ~ it's very small..the size of a dime maybe..and it's perfect, I was looking for a small cat charm to add to my bracelet after my 16 year old cat passed away..this one reminded me of her..sitting in the window. Shipped FAST and packaged perfectly <end>  SMALL  This is one of those things that you need to read the entire description. If I had noticed the description of the charm as being as tiny as it is, I would not have purchased it. The ring that will hold it to a bracelet or chain is nearly bigger than the charm. It is dwarfed by a Pandora bead. I'll keep it, but I am disappointed. <end>  Don't let the picture trick you, this is a small charm!  This charm is much smaller than it looks online. Compared to the other charms on my bracelet, this one is really little. I guess it makes sense, considering how much cheaper it is than most charms. It is cute and of good quality, but definitely tiny! <end>

 B000FIPRVE  Rembrandt Charms House Charm ||	  Home Sweet Home  This high quality silver charm brought a huge smile to my wife's face when she opened it. It works perfectly with her charm bracelet and was big enough to see the details without being so large as to be heavy and clunky. <end>
 B000FIPRZ0  Rembrandt Charms Four Leaf Clover Charm ||	  Cute bracelet charm  Purchased this in sterling silver. It's a nice size for a charm bracelet. Note as the jewelry specification states, its small, less than half an inch in size. Rembrandt also has a larger 4-leaf clover which is almost an inch across. I bought that as well and added it to a silver chain as a gift for my niece, which she loved. <end>  Not what I expected!  I felt the picture did not show that the charm looked smaller than a baby charm. I was very disappointed for the money. <end>

 B000FIRKVY  Rembrandt Charms Graduation Cap Charm ||	  Nice, but bead falls off  I received this charm in 2002 for my high school graduation. The first time I wore the charm bracelet after that, the pearl bead fell off! I had it glued back on by the jewelry store more times than I can remember, and eventually it got lost entirely. I still like the charm, but there is a noticeable spot where the bead should be, and it just isn't right without it. <end>
 B000FIRNC0  Rembrandt Charms Comb & Scissors Charm ||	  Comb & Scissors Charm  This is a fun charm. It was a gift for my mother, who was a hair dresser for many years. It is very nice to find charms for her that are a part of who she has been over the years. <end>

 B000FISKD6  Clearly Charming October Pink Tourmaline Color Butterfly Birthstone Insect Animal Italian Charm ||	  Beautiful Butterfly  This is absolutely beautiful and the colors are rich, it looks great on my italian charm bracelet <end>  Cute for birthstone representation  Definitely cute but it does catch on things at times as it sticks out slightly. However, worth the purchase if you are looking for a cute represenation of your birthstone. <end>
 B000FISZUO  Rembrandt Charms Trumpet Charm ||	  Sterling Silver Trumpet Charm  Trumpet was pretty nice, although really small. Was going to send item back but didn't want to have to pay restocking fee and shipping charges. Item did not come with little silver attachment for attaching the charm to necklace so is of no use. Wasted my money. <end>

Item looks exactly as pictured. <end>  Faith Hope and Charity  Returned this charm..As I wrote earlier, buy the discs, they are more attractive..This charm is very small..There was no problem, and the people were courteous.. <end>

 B000FJ2IHE  February Birthstone, Natural Amethyst 1/4 Carat (4mm) Size Brilliant Cut Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver Basket Setting ||	  Nice color  Very beautiful color, slightly lighter than in the picture. Well designed and made, good silver. Although one of the stones had noticeable scratches, I am satisfied with what I got. These tiny studs are perfect for their purpose - my wife's ear is pierced twice, and she uses it as an additional earring. <end>
 B000FJ4BPQ  December Birthstone, Natural Blue Topaz 1/2 Carat (5mm) Size Brilliant Cut Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver Basket Setting ||	  Lovely earrings!  I just received these earrings and they are very pretty. The 1/2 carat for each ear is a really nice size, and the color of the stones is wonderful, sort of an ocean/island blue, deeper than swiss and lighter than london blue topaz. The color in the photo is almost right if you can imagine adding a hint of yellow or green to the blue, causing it to look a little more medium aquamarine or, again, like ocean/island water. The faceting is nice and the earrings show good sparkle and allow light to come through, without diminishing the color. I'm very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Would have been nice but stones not matched in color  These would have been nice except the stones were not matched in color. Both were like a Swiss blue topaz color but there was a difference in color between them. It may have just been the pair I received. I could tell the difference so I sent them back. <end>
 B000FJ60PU  Stunning, Large Genuine Citrine Cocktail Ring Emerald Cut 16 Carats ||	  Beautiful!  I love this ring! It's more beautiful than any citrine I've found in stores - and cost much less. <end>  Citrine Citation  I had no idea how big a 16 carat stone is until my ring arrived! The citrine stone is clear and well cut. I always get compliments when I wear it. <end>

 B000FKBMK2  Sterling Silver Emerald Green Resin Wide Dome Ring with Cubic Zirconia Stones ||	  so many compliments!  I absolutely love this ring! very easy to wear (it feels comfortable on me all day), and it has stood up extremely well to daily wear for the last year. I get compliments almost daily also! I want to get one in the other colors that are available too! <end>
 B000FKBNKQ  Sterling Silver Floral Topaz Blue Resin Ring size 9 ||	  I'm wearing it now!  This ring is better than I expected. The attention to detail on this ring is truly surprising for the price. I wear it all the time and get plenty of compliments on how unique it is. <end>
 B000FKD94E  Sterling Silver Floral Design Blue Enamel Ring with Cubic Zirconia Stones ||	  A pretty ring  This ring is very pretty, a little more sparkly than the picture indicates. The quality is appropriate for the price. I returned it because it was a tiny bit too small, in a way that told me the next size up would be too big - pity. <end>
 B000FKGW4I  Wide Sterling Silver Turquoise Armor Band Ring Size 10(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  Great pinkie ring  I bought this ring for my little finger and it looks great there. I agree with the reviewer that the metal is thin, but I guessed that by looking at the picture and it doesn't bother me. In my opinion the ring looks good, fits well, and is all sorts of shiny so I'm pleased with it. <end>  nice ring, very thin metal  The ring is pretty enough, but the metal it is made of of is so thin that you can squash it quite easily. I don't think you can tell this by looking at the photos on Amazon. <end>  AWESOMEE  i got this ring and im obsessed with it! I have it on my middle finger and it fits great. Ive had it for a week and i have not noticed that the metal is thin. It also hasnt dented yet. All around this is an awesme ring and i would totally recomend that you buy it!  ) <end>  Fun Ring, Not Perfect  There's nothing wrong with the artistic features of this ring, nor the workmanship. As others have stated, the silver could be perceived as "thin". However, for a ring of this width that's a good thing. Were the silver any thicker, it would be unwieldy to wear. I would suggest you buy a size up from your regular size, otherwise your finger might feel "smothered". It gets sweaty pretty quickly. The only thing that would make me say "WOW!" would be if the silver were brushed so that it really glowed. As it is, this is a very nice ring, especially on my middle finger, but not a spectacular one. The silver is... well, it's silver, but not a silver that *POPS*. But I'm also INCREDIBLY picky.Recommended. B+ <end>  I love it!  People are correct in saying that this ring is kinda thin...but come on..really....for the price you are paying, this ring f'ing ROCKS! If you dont wear other rings next to it, or get in fist fights i think you'll be ok. Its Totally indie and tribal. I belly dance, and i would totally wear this while dancing. And im pretty sure i'll end up buying MORE rings from this vendor. I bought this ring for my middle finger and it is a GREAT look! you should totally buy it! <end>  Charming!  It is thin silver like others have said, but it is so beautiful!More pretty in real life than the pictures show.If you don't slam it hard on anything,I don't imagine it denting.The stone in the middle is smooth and well set.It also fits very well and looks good on female hands.I definitely recommend this ring. <end>  Nice Ring!!!  I like the ring very much. It is a little smaller than I expected. Aside from that I am very happy with it. <end>  awesome  I am very satisfied with the purchase i made. i do not take the ring off because it looks so great with everything...buy it.perfect size and cut <end>  Wonderful  I recieved the jewlery in a lil velvet satchel..Its great quality ..Better priced then going to NYC ..Seriously I couldn't be any happier with this purchase ) <end>  Wide Sterling Silver Turquoise Armor Band Ring  I love wearing this ring with other silver/turquoise rings...just wish it were a heavier metal. Its very comfortable to wear on my middle finger.... <end>  ring  the material the ring is made from is a little too fragile. otherwise its ok <end>  Beautiful, turqouise ring!  While I agree with other reviews that the silver is fairly thin, I adore this ring. I get compliments on it all the time! It instantly became my favorite ring. <end>  Nice ring  I love rings, and this one is better than I expected. I got #5 to wear on my pinky.No matter the reviews, I go with my instinct. I'm glad I did. <end>  not what I thought it was  I got this ring and I never wear it. The sizing is smaller than it saids. And the turquoise stone stick up way to far, the one time I wore it it got caught on everthing! <end>
 B000FL06NU  Sterling Silver Scalloped Dome Ring 7/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  shiny silver  This ring was beautiful. The silver was very shiny and goes well with my diamond rings. Great price, too. <end>  Elegant, smooth, heavy silver - Great Price.  I really love the way this ring looks on my well manicured hands. It is one of those rings that you can wear comfortably everyday because it goes with everything. The silver is surprisingly sturdy for this price. I bought it 2 years ago and it is still beautiful. <end>
 B000FL06SK  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Wedding Band / Thumb Ring 3/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Celtic ring  I ordered this ring for myself,and I must say it's beautiful.The only disadvantage is,that on the other side of the ring the endless knot ends.  DThey couldn't make it that the knot run into one point,instead there is a little part of the ring(3-4mm) that is without motive.I'm wearing this site down,so it doesn't disturb me.It's cool anyway,I recommend it. <end>  Celtic Ring= BEAUTIFUL!  This ring is almost authentic to the real deal if this was brought from Ireland; I really enjoy the weaves around the ring, but was disappointed when they ended at a certain point instead of going around continuously. Other than that, this ring was definitely worth the money, and I'm very satisfied. Wonderful, simply wonderful! <end>  Silver Band  It's a bit thinner than I would have liked, but overall it is a beautiful ring and I enjoy wearing it. <end>
 B000FL06YO  Sterling Silver Flower Vine Wedding Band Ring 3/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Cute, but flawed  The design is adorable, but unfortunately, there's a big ugly seam on the back of the ring that ruins the flow. <end>
 B000FL06ZI  Sterling Silver Large Sun Ring, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Lied about being sterling silver  I really liked the rings design but it rusted after about 3 days of use.. Due to the price, i was expecting it to be good quality.. Do not recommend at all <end>
 B000FL073O  Sterling Silver Polished Fish Ring 1/4 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Adorable  At first I thought this ring would be thin but I was surprised when I got it because it's quite sturdy. Really, really adorable. Exactly like the picture except it's smaller than I thought. All in all, it's a great buy. Fast shipping too! Might get some for my friends. <end>
 B000FL1DWS  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Wedding Band / Thumb Ring, 1/4 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Great polish and finish  I ordered this band to replace one I'd purchased elsewhere but lost. I'm very happy that the new one is of the same high quality as the one I lost. There's something magical in the shape of the knots. It is a fine work and very shiny. In reality it looks somewhat better than on this photo. I love this ring. <end>  It is so pretty,  It is so pretty, and perfect for my daughter. It is good to be able to purchase quality plus sized rings. Saving the $50+ re-sizing fees.Service was timely, and presentation box was cute. <end>  It is highly recommended. I am in love with it after 4 months os use.  I'm writing is review after 4 month of wearing this ring, here is what I have noticed - Durable.- Great looking ring, I have received many compliments over different occasions.- Not suffering from ring marks any more.- Helped in healing my finger after being irritated by the previous ring (by just having those "holes" that allowed my skin to breath normaly).- It is only annoying when washing your hands with soap bars (in particular soap BAR) because it gets in those holes and takes little more time to be cleaned. (FYI, this is soooo not a problem, it is just a note).- clean it with silver shining products and you have it shining back as new... (my opinion, I loved it "matt" better)I hope this info was usefull for you. Good luck shopping. <end>  neat looking ring  ring was great for a while, but soon it started to change shape. Now the ring is almost square and where there was stress, it broke. I thought it was heavier when i bought it, but i guess i was wrong. Looked great while it lasted. I would buy again if it was alot thicker! <end>  It is very pretty,indeed.  It is a present to my niece and she carries it all the time and she said that it has brought her luck...-))) <end>
 B000FL1DXM  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Wedding Band / Thumb Ring, 1/4 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Very pretty, not flimsy at all!  I ordered this ring before I read the review about it being very flimsy and bending easily. I was disappointed, but of course, being me, when I received my order, the first thing I did was try to bend it out of shape. It doesn't bend at all. I've had it for over a week now and have continually tried to bend it and/or break it. It still looks fairly new. I have a very hands-on job, and my hands take a beating (and therefore any rings I tend to get beat up) but after four days at work this ring still looks pretty good (two other rings I recieved the same day are already pretty scratched). The design hides the little scratches well. I'm not sure whether my ring is scratched or if it's just in the metal! I would recommend this to anyone. I love it! <end>  Flimsy  Although the ring is very nice looking it bent easily. Maybe I don't know enough about metals or silver in particular to know what kind of durability to expect, but this ring was really soft, almost like pewter. It just didn't have the quality I was expecting. <end>  Celtic Band  I had been looking for this ring for a long time. The ring is of good quality and everything I had hoped for. Would not think twice ordering from them again. <end>  Celtic Band  I am very pleased with my product as I had lost a ring very similar to it......it looks even better then my original and was delivered right away. Great ring....it's my favorite! <end>  Exactly what I wanted...  Its a cute ring. It was kind of tight at first, but after a few wears it starts to give a tad and it fits very nicely. Very shiny, and durable. <end>  Pretty ring, but it bends easily  After only 3 days of normal wear, my ring somehow got bent, and as a result, there are now a couple points in the "links" that are separated. Not so much that I can't wear the ring, but I am concerned about it breaking in half if it gets bent again. <end>  Very nice  Very nice ring, much nicer on the finger than in the picture. I was very impressed  ) <end>  Nice enough  This ring is nice. It seems to be smaller than the ordered size, which is a little frustrating. But all around, it's a great ring. <end>  Great quality, Even better price  I bought this for my girlfriend to replace a similar one that she lost. It is very durable and high quality. The sizing is perfect (not too big or small) and it looks great in combination with other ring(s). Great buy. <end>  Perfect!  This is a great looking everyday ring. I wear it on my thumb, it is very comfortable and attractive. Just perfect! <end>  Great thumb ring for someone whose not a fanatic  I really like the ring. I am not a jewelery person, I've always hated earrings and rings. I never wear anything that I can't wear with everything, all the time. But. . . I put this on and I think it fits perfectly. I googled ring sizes to figure out mine. It is loose enough to move up and down, but it doesn't go slip past my thumb joint. If I need to remove it the easiest way is soap and water. I like thumb rings because I box and do martial arts and when I punch, the ring doesn't get in the way. The design is pretty as well. It goes with everything so I never take it off. I recommend. <end>  Wedding Band  This was for my husband's wedding band. He wanted something unique, but I was worried about sterling silver standing the test of time and wear. He has not taken it off for 2 years now and so far so good! no turning colors or bending! <end>  love this ring  This ring is a beautiful shiny silver band. I love the celtic never-ending knot design. I like the fact that the design goes completely around the ring, and doesn't have a "solid space" because my rings twirl around my finger and I wouldn't want to keep twirling it back around to see the design. It's sturdy and well made and fits nicely. I wear a 5 1/2 size ring so I ordered a size 6 and it is just right for my hand. It is about a 1/4 inch width and would not be suitable to wear with other rings on the same finger, but it looks very nice as a solo ring. I am very pleased with it. <end>  celtic knot ring  Very nice, would order again. Fast service and exchange for proper size too. Heavy - and not skimpy. Is as it looks. Very happy. <end>
 B000FL1DZ0  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Wedding Band / Thumb Ring 3/8 inch wide, sizes 4 - 11 ||	  Very nice  I wear this ring all the time. Very comfortable, well made, and good price. Good weight and thickness, and is wearing well. <end>  Love it!  I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and I was very impressed with the quality of the workmanship. The only drawback was I had been planning on getting it engraved on the side without the knotwork. However the band is tapered so I'm afraid it's too narrow for engraving. Other than that, I love the ring and highly recommend it! <end>
 B000FL1E04  Sterling Silver Double Heart Cut-outs Ring 5/16 inch wide, size 9.5 ||	  Very Lovely Two Heart Ring  I'm a heart nut.

 B000FL1E4U  Sterling Silver Flower Vine Ring 7/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  So pretty!  This is a very pretty ring. The design is delicate-looking, but it actually quite sturdy when pressure is applied. It feels true to size and is very comfortable to wear. <end>  Flower Ring- Love It!!  I received this item a day before the earliest suggested date, which was an excellent surprise. The ring is exactly as it is in the picture, both beautiful and sturdy and it fit perfectly. I highly reccomend this ring to anyone interested. Thank you!!! <end>  gift for girlfriend  my girlfriend really liked it and it fit perfect i got this along with another ring for valentines day <end>  beautiful  This ring is so beautiful! I can't get over how pretty it is! No complaints. It fits, it is exactly what I ordered and it is gorgeous. Not too big or small. <end>  Great Item!  I am so very pleased I received it before it was due to arrive and it was exactly what i ordered and I wear it all the time. <end>  Lovely!  Exceeds expectations and I adore this ring! I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and it seems very durable for everyday wear. <end>
 B000FL1E6I  Sterling Silver Hand Holding Flower Ring 7/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Very delicate  This is a very thin delicate ring. The fingers are to long and ends have rough edges that allow forsnagging clothing. I have ordered from this company before and been happy - I love the designof the ring but would like for it to be thicker - the hand a little bit better designed even at a highercost. Not an everyday ring. <end>
 B000FL1E90  Sterling Silver Thin Stars, Moon & Sun Wedding Band Ring, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  UNHAPPY CUSTOMER  I PURCHASED THIS RNG, STERLING SILVER THIN STARS! I ALSO PURCHASED STERLING SILVER MOON AN STAR RING! I RECEIVED THEM JULY 15TH. I HAVE WORE THEM ONE DAY AN THEY BOTH HAVE TURNED MY FINGER GREEN!!!!I BELIEVED THEY WERE REAL SILVER?? I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER SILVER RINGS THAT DO NOT TURN MY FINGER GREEN!!!!!SORRY I AM NOT SATISFIED.....THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION... <end>  Cute!  I like this ring a lot. It's kinda cute. It's really thin, only a little over 1/8 of an inch and I prefer thicker rings, but I just wear it with another ring and it looks really neat. Worth the money I spent! <end>
 B000FL1E9U  Sterling Silver Elephant Ring 3/16 inch wide, size 9.5 ||	  left a green ring around my finger  I thought this was a absolutely cute ring when I took it out of the package, I was later disappointed when I took it off and noticed the green ring left on my skin, I can't wear anything but sterling silver so I question if this ring is real or not..still a cute ring but I can't wear it <end>  Perfect  Gets caught on some things sometimes, but it's small and cute and I love it! <end>  cute!  very small and very cute. worth the money, because it comes with a very reasonable price tag, even with shipping. <end>  impressed  i was impressed with this ring. its small but sturdy. and it literally arrived 2 days after i purchased it online. very prompt which sometimes isnt the case, so that was nice. the ring intself is very cute and ive received many compliments. <end>  Lucky Charm wrapped around my finger!  I absolutely love my little elephant ring. I received it last year for Christmas (2007) from my loving mother, who knows my obsession, or might I say my collection! I collect elephants with their trunks up, they are considered a good luck charm in a few different cultures, and I can use all the luck I can get. Plus, they're soooo flippin cute, How could I resist them, I love my ring, definitely worth the price, which is an excellent deal, and another great thing, it doesn't leave a green circle around my finger like other "SILVER" products I've purchased, Definitely Worth the money!! <end>  Absolutely Adorable  I ordered this ring for my friend and she LOVES it. The detail on the elephant is good, and the ring is a great value for the price.It was shipped the day after ordering and arrived two days after that. <end>  Elephant Ring  This ring is really cute!! The price is excellent! My only problem with this ring is that it catches on everything. Towels, sweaters, jean pockets, etc. Of course, I wear it anyway, but you must be careful you don't damage other things!! <end>  Very Good  I know my little sister will love this. It is wonderful. The ring is sturdy and the elephant seems well attached. It's small size will keep it out of the way while still looking great. I suggest this ring to any who like inexpensive well made jewelry. <end>  Love this little ring  Great little ring for a good price...this is a ring you will want to wear with another ring (or two!) stacked against it as the trunk gets caught on things if you don't! <end>
 B000FL29BC  JJ Weston Classical elegance. Silver plated set of cufflinks and shirt studs set with mother of pearl with presentation box. Made in the U.S.A ||	  Fastest Delivery Ever!

 B000FL3GQE  Sterling Silver Bali Style Rope Wedding Band Ring, sizes 6 - 10, 1/4 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Silver ring  I was very much pleased with the selection choices, the price, and the quick shipment. <end>
 B000FL3GVE  Sterling Silver Polished Dolphin Ring 1/4 inch wide, size 9.5 ||	  deceptively thin  this ring is much larger in the picture. It is deceptive. The dolphin is smaller than my pinky finger nail and the band about as thin as a penny. It is pretty but could be much prettier and much more durable with a little more effort. You do get what you pay for, I will not be buying from this seller again though. <end>  Silver is too thin on ring band  Cute ring but the silver is so thin that it broke within 2 days of wearing it. Low quality item. <end>
 B000FL50PO  Sterling Silver Swirl Design Dome Ring 5/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Item Just as Shown  I've been wearing this ring for the past six months and it is still beautiful. <end>
 B000FL50PY  Sterling Silver Hearts & Flowers Link Wedding Band Ring, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Very Poor Quality  The ring was not the one pictured and described. Instead, the designs were very poorly stamped and the ring was not neatly sautered, plus it didn't have the antiqued effect. I had to pay money to get and then return this misleading product. <end>  pretty  I received this item pretty quickly. it's a cute little ring, but its more for younger girls. <end>
 B000FL50WW  Sterling Silver Polished Elephant Ring 3/8 wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  LOVE IT  Wonderful quality. Very cute and unique. I like how it has dimension but it doesn't stick out far from my finger at all. I've been wearing since I got it - sleep, shower, setting up hot air balloons. It doesn't snag on anything. Perfect everyday ring for the average elephant enthusiast. <end>
 B000FLTIYS  14k Yellow Gold and Pink Tourmaline Children's Heart Pendant, 15" ||	  Disappointing  We bought this item for our daughter for Christmas last year. When it arrived, it turned out that the pendant was nearly microscopic in size. It was also on a very flimsy chain, which broke almost immediately. Disappointed, and not recommended for kids. <end>  heart necklace  i was alittle disappointed in the size of the stone. the necklace itself is very nice and looks to be a very sturdy chain. overall it looks very nice on my granddaughter. <end>  Very delicate necklace, good gift for a young girl.  This necklace has a very, very delicate chain and a tiny pendant, about 1/3rd of an inch with a pink tourmaline in the center. I bought it for my 10 year old daughter during an Amazon sale for $10.It was a real bargain for that price and my daughter loves it. She has a very slim neck so the 15 inch is a bit too long for her but should be ok for any other tween. The pendant itself is very small and delicate and she loves the pink stone in the middle. She hasn't taken it off since she put it on last month. Since it is gold I don't have to worry about any skin irritations which she can get from cheaper metals. I usually don't let her wear jewelery to school but this necklace is very delicate and does not look out of place with her school outfits. The chain though delicate is sturdy enough not to break just through regular usage.I would not recommend this necklace for a girl older than 13 yrs as it will be too small and too delicate to look good and you will be disappointed. <end>  michelle  Beyond disappointed. we bought this for our daughter for her birthday and returned it immediately.the pendant is sooooo tiny it is hard to see on the necklace. <end>
 B000FLTJ0Q  Sterling Silver Sculpted Open Circle Pendant, 18" ||	  Pendant & Necklace  The pendant is striking, shiny, and great to look at. The diameter of the pendant is the size that I expected and the necklace itself is adjustable so you can choose how high or low you want to wear it. Great purchase, would buy it again. <end>  Large  I just received this and yes it is shiny, has a nice chain that holds this large 2" by 2" inch nice looking, heavy duty, sterling silver circle. But the circle is too large for my taste. It is a nice peice of jewelry if you like LARGE jewery. <end>  Big and dopey looking.  It looks nice in the picture, but it's actually probably too large for casual wearing. <end>
 B000FLX2PE  Sterling Silver Children's Bangle Bracelet ||	  Broke too quickly  This is the second time I bought this bracelet. I figured the first one broke by a fluke so I purchased another one. Nope, this broken even quicker than the first one. I'm really disappointed. My 3-year-old daughter wore it every day for 3 months before she handed it to me one day with the broken clasp. Literally, the clasp just gave way. I'd like to return it for a new one, but can't seem to find any way to get a response. <end>  Such a pretty bracelet!  Bought this for my niece's first birthday and had her name and birth date engraved on it. Had to do the engraving on the outside though because the metal has a seam on the inside of the bracelet.Even at 9 months old she already loves jewelry hehe, so I'm sure she'll love playing with it once her birthday rolls around. It's a bit too big for her at the moment, but that was expected. I figure she could play with it and wear it for a while. <end>  Perfect Child's Bracelet  I bought it for my baby girl. She is 18 months old. It is too big for her now but she will be able to wear it soon. It looks like a good quality piece of jewelry. I am sure she will wear it for years. <end>  Good quality; solid bracelet  I purchased this for my Goddaughter's baptism. It's a nice bracelet she will wear for special occasions or church for a long time. I was a little skeptic because the price is so reasonable, but was pleasantly surprised at the quality. The details are a nice touch. <end>  cute bracelet  Bought this bangle for my 17 month old, she's been wearing it for a couple of days and shows it off. Looks and feels like good quality I'm pleased so far. <end>  Bangle  I purchased this bracelet for my two year old granddaughter. I am satisfied with the weight of the bracelet and have had it engraved.My granddaughter thinks "it's pretty".The only issue I have with it is it is difficult to open the latch. <end>  What every little girl wants!  I was a little hesitant about buying children's jewelry online because I've seen first hand the quality of most children's jewelry on the market. This bracelet was a pleasant surprise. It is well made, sturdy and was a big hit with the little one on her birthday, not to mention with her parents. Her father commented that it looks and feels just like adult jewelry but on a smaller scale. I especially liked it because it didn't have tacky carvings or danglies on it and it was a good weight. It was a big hit, to say the least, and well worth the price. I highly recommend it for the little girls in your life! <end>  I want to love this bracelet, but I have a few concerns...  Length   2 49 MinsI wanted to love this bracelet, the price is right and the style is beautiful, but it just didn't work for me. I received the bracelet very quickly, (I love Amazon prime) and I opened it with great expectations. The bracelet is very sturdy, shiny, and has a beautiful decoration.The issues that I have regarding the bracelet are 1. The hinge closing does not fit flush with the other connection side, one side sits higher that the other side. Even when I applied pressure to both sides, it still remains staggered.2. There is a gap in the interior of the bracelet, near the closing clasp. If you look at Amazon's picture of the item, you can see the gap. I missed this point when I purchased. (FYI  If you are curious, the bracelet is marked with "STUR" instead of the .925 as seen in most sterling silver jewelry. According to research that I read, "STUR" and .925 are interchangeable markings for sterling silver. Hope this review can help find you a more suitable selection for your little one. <end>  Beautiful bracelet  I bought this bracelet for my granddaughter for her 3rd birthday. It looks so pretty on her and it fits perfect. I was worried because the other reviews were mostly about getting them for babies and I was thinking it wouldn't fit. <end>  Very cute...  I bought this for my 15 month old and it's a beautiful first piece of jewelry for her. She even knows it's pretty because she holds out her arm so people can look at it. I've had it on her for a few days - baths and all - and it must be comfortable because she doesn't mess with it. All in all, a cute bracelet and no regrets about buying it. <end>  BEAUTIFUL GIFT TIFFANY'S QUALITY!  THIS IS GORGEOUS- ME AND MY DAUGHTERS BABY SIT FOR A FEW NEW MOMS- THIS IS THE BABY GIRL GIFT- SO SO LOVELY A HEIRLOOM QUALITY ITEM- BOUGHT ONE IN BERMUDA AT THE TRENDY HIGH END SHOP- PAID OVER $100 FOR THIS----LOVE IT AND THE NEW MOMS LOVE IT ALSO.AMAZON IS THE BEST-- PROVIDES 85% OF MY MONTHLY PURCHASES//// EXPENSES- KC IN NJ <end>  Good purchase  This is a nice bracelet and very well made. I'm glad with the purchase and it looks super cute in my toddler's arm! I recommend! <end>  Very Pretty but Unusable  This bracelet is very pretty and my daughter loves to wear it. However, the clasp won't stay closed and it comes off of her after a few minutes of wearing it. She can easily get it off herself but it also comes undone from normal wear. I was hoping since it has the push button closure that it would be more difficult for her to remove and that it would help prevent it from getting lost. It did not meet my expectations. <end>  Sterling Silver Bracelet  Beautiful sterling silver bracelet. My 4-year old niece just loved it. And, it was just the perfect size. The shipping was very timely. I would defintitely order again from this seller. Beverly <end>  Sterling Silver Children's Bangle Bracelet  I was surprised to find it looking better than I expected.....very rich and of excellent quality. I purchased them for Christmas gifts and was so proud to give them. Parents of the children receiving them were in awe and I know they think they were much more expensive than they actually were. I got a lot for my money in purchasing them! Thank you. <end>  Really Cute  I bought this as a gift. Ironically- it fit nice on a 12 year old, but not the 9 year old(larger wrist) that i bought it for. I had to send it back because it didnt fit. It doesnt 'completely' open. there is like a metal extender in the inside. Still Gorgeous. <end>
 B000FLYMG2  14k Yellow Gold and Amethyst Children's Heart Earrings ||	  Too small  I returned these. They were purchased for my granddaughter's birthday, she is four and a little peanut of a child. They were too small for her.These will always be referred to as the "Quantum earrings" in our family because we could only prove they existed mathematically. If light had not bent around them we would have needed an electron microscope to prove they existed at all.These are the perfect size for a 6 week old zygote but too small for any human older than that. <end>  really nice!!  I bought these for my neice who was 6 at the time. They are very pretty and nice and small for little fingers and little ears. The purple color was a good medium purple. <end>
 B000FM2YIO  6 Drawer Wide Chest (Black) (26.813"H x 21.25"W x 15.25"D) ||	  Easy Pull Drawers - NO DRAWER STOPS  Bought the chest (no assembly required) and for its simplicity, it rates as an acceptable cart of drawers. However, if you keep anything breakable or semi-heavy in the drawers, note that they slide super easily and have no back-of-drawer stops ... the drawers will pull right out onto the floor with the greatest of ease. I would only recommend for very light contents, like cloth material scraps, etc. <end>  Great drawers  We got these for my mother-in-law for more storage in a rest home.They are easy for her to open and see what's in them. Since she's in a wheel chair she really can't use the bottom drawers but these work very well. <end>  6 drawer wide chest  This chest is very useful. It is very well made. The only thing I wish it had was dividers within the drawers themselves. <end>  DO NOT BUY! No drawer STOPS!!!! - Iris 6-Drawer Extra-Capacity Drawer Chest  I have no idea what IRIS was thinking when they designed this product.The engineer should be fired.Who designs a drawer without a drawer stop?This was a gift and I am sending it back!!!DO NOT BUY!!!! and make sure that it is clearly written on any other product descriptions that you may be looking at.The features include ....."Drawer stops prevent drawers from falling out"What a joke! <end>
 B000FMKIFK  Sterling Silver Red Braided Rubber 18" Cord Necklace ||	  Colored Ropes for Neckalces  These make great buys to combine with any of their pendants. They have different colors and different materials (silk, leather, rope, etc). Put together to make wonderful xmas presents or for yourself making your outfit match with the necklace. Recommend <end>
 B000FNALGU  Pink Passion Aaliyah Chandelier Earrings ||	  cheap & ugly  i wish i could do 0 stars... it is cheap and looks like it is already tarnishing...... it is not shiny like in the pictures ... and i tryed to contact the seller and THEY NEVER CONTACTED ME BACK..... dont buy product or from this seller <end>  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!  This pair of earrings is very pretty but a few problems. First, they are not as big as they seem. Second, they are very fragile. Third, It TURNED MY EAR BLUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! <end>
 B000FNALI8  Matte Gold Light Smoked Topaz Austrian Crystal Glitz Chandelier Earrings ||	  Not as shown  The item was totally horrible. The beads were rubber and looked horrid <end>
 B000FNALJ2  Pink Devotion Heart Earrings ||	  Nicer in the photo  These are a cute design, but the actual earrings are not the quality they seem in the photo. The materials seem of low quality. <end>
 B000FNCCTY  Passionate Desiree Chandelier Earrings ||	  blah!!!!!!!!!!  The earrring seems pretty but there are different color stones in some places random colors like green and dark blue!!!!!!! IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!!!!It is smaller than it seems..........way smaller!!!!! DO NOT BUY! most earrings from this seller are TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! <end>  Not as pretty as the pictures  Even though these were a very low price, when the $3.25 in shipping was added (to mail half an ounce), it became a very bad deal. For the same price you could go to any retail store and get nicer earrings. The photos are very deceiving. They look great (and the magnified a lot) in the picture, but the real thing is not as beautiful and multi-colored. I have bought a lot of jewelry for my daughter on the internet in the past few months, and most of the time, it is nothing like the photos. After this, I am sticking to the retail stores. That is where you know if something is really pretty or not. I thought that saving on sales tax and gas was worth it, but the postage/shipping fees kill any real savings, and then the fact is most of this mail-order jewelry looks like it was rejected by the Dollar Store. <end>
 B000FNEH2O  Ruby Red Tessa Chandelier Earrings ||	  Nicer looking online.  Unfortunately, these look much cuter online than in real life. The design is wonderful, but the quality is definitely cheap, with the "stones" appearing plastic. <end>
 B000FNGPB0  Phiten Classic Titanium Necklace ||	  this is a great product  this is a GREAT product. i am on my feet 8 to 12 hours a day. im a chef, before i used this my lower and upper back and shoulders killed me. now i dont even feel them. when i take the necklace off when go to bed i dont sleep wiht stuff around my neck. my back starts screaming. i have had one before and gave it to my boss because he had wicked bad back. i also play golf and i dropped 3 shots because i had more flexiblity and my back wasnt hurting at all when i finished all 36 holes. <end>  good  I don't know if it really works or not but recently my husband had to help my neighbor's moving and he 'felt' he recovered faster after that and 'feels' good every morning with it. Feels good = endolphine, right?I should've gotten one size smaller though. If you are not that huge muscle built around your neck 16" for a guy whould've been just fine. <end>  I'm a believer  I'm an active 49 year old female who was having chronic hip and knee pain, especially when sleeping. Last month Amazon had great special on the PHITEN stuff so I gave it a try. I'm a believer. No more hip and knee pain. I wear the necklace 24/7 except in shower and have purchased the titanium discs and stick them on any spots that feel sore after a strenuous day. The products are amazing. What have you got to lose with Amazon's excellent return policy. <end>  NOT FOR ME  I have used one of these for a month, and I have observed myself, my general wellbeing, and my backpain with and without the necklace, while sleeping, while doing sport, while at the office... and I have not noticed any difference at all. For this, and because, in my research, I have not been able to find a even a single scientifically justified reason for these to work, I am giving it one star. I only hope that others read this review and think twice before spending their money. <end>  Customer Service Sucks  I have also seen many people wear these. I workout a lot. I decided to order two braclets and measured my wrist at 7 1/8 and order 7 1/2. I could not close the clasp. I sent them back only to have them returned!!! They told me it was custom- I order one black and one orange- how is that custom. I talked to two CS reps with the same answer- non-refundable!! They could have saved one customer by giving the correct size and sending back, instead they go to the expense of writing a letter and postage to send back the braclets.I have many people ask me about these in the gym- I can now tell them- DO NOT BUY, THE CS SUCKS. I guess I will find some kid in Middle School with skinny wrist and give it to them. I'm blown away. <end>  Read the package make-source  I personally used the tape and the e-water lotion together and the combination effectively subdue my neck-shoulder ache which I have for many years. I applied the lotion daily after bath at night and replace the tape every 2-3 days. I am convinced with the technology that I decided to try their jewellery products since having the tape seen on body is not a pretty sight to public eye. Before I make any haste/impulse purchase, I googled for the product reviews and realised it is a mixed reviews - ~50 50 positive and negative. As I am convinced with what I have experienced with the tape and lotion effect, so I decided to trust my gut feeling to get the bracelet. I take it as the 50% negative reviews could be because the users do not have any pain/aches to begin with so they do not experience any "miracle". For example, if you have a flawless skin to begin with, you will not expect any miracle effect even if you apply La-mer/SKII/Lancome/Estee Lauder expensive skincare product daily. That's the logic. I seriously ALMOST buy this product until I turned over the package and saw this  Made in PXXXXXXXXXS (not Japan!). Instantaneously, I put back the item on the shelf and re-purchased the tape and lotion (both are made in Japan) instead. Now I know why the split review on the bracelets because the manufacturing source is different - this is my gut feel by the way. I rather tape around my body inconspiciously to mimick the jewellery claimed effect than buying the actual jewellery where the quality is questionable by my gut-feeling and so not comfortable in buying at all. <end>  Very Good Necklace  it has deffenitly worked for me. i have loved it and i would recomend it. altho i bought it a little big it still has worked just fine. <end>  Satisfied customer  The product was exactly as we expected and was shipped in a timely manner. No complaints. <end>  Ummmmm...  I am not sure what I was expecting from this product...but pain relief from the short amount of time I've worn it has been unnoticed. <end>  Nice necklace  Exactly what i expected and saw online and in the store. No healing abilities but it was no surprise. I like it and i think it is ok for its price. <end>  Helps me sleep better  I wear it mostly at night, or if I will be very active (skiing, etc.). Seems to work for me! <end>  Great gift for a hard to please baseball fan  I know it's only a necklace but my husband is so hard to buy gifts for and he's a major Red Sox fan, so this was a great gift. I guess many baseball players wear these(the superstitious ones) to enhance their game. The necklace is suppose to have titanium in it, thus producing "majical powers". What ever the case my husband was surprised I noticed the players wearing them and has worn his every day since recieving it. Now that I think of it, he has improved in certain areas  ). In summary, this is a great inexpensive gift. <end>  phiten titanium star neckless  the neckless is ok but the company i bought it from are very rude would never buy an ite fro the again.EVER <end>  Nice product  Purchased this as gift for my daughter. It looks great and she loves it. I can't say much more about it. <end>  Mhmm, like it.  I had bought this for my fiance for a gift and he still wears it. He loves it. I would buy him another if he wanted one. <end>  To big and it was faded  The necklace was way to big and it was not the hot pink that was shown in the picture it had a more faded look. <end>  Good buy on a Phiten  This was the best buy I could find on a Phiten as Christmas time. I believe I paid around $7 plus about $5 shipping. Shipping is a bit high for such a lighrweight item but the necklace itself seems durable and my 13 son wears it every day. <end>  Not exactly as it appears  We have several Phitens - all of which are in the blue or black family. My daughter wanted an orange one, since her team colors are orange and white. In the photo, this looks like it is truly orange - and bright! The reality is that it's not. It's a very dingy color, nearly brownish, and it almost looks as though it's gone through mud and then someone attempted to wash it. Suffice it to say, I bought it for her for xmas, and she hasn't worn it yet. I'm thinking it will stay on her bureau. It's too bad. <end>  Glad to have a new one...but....  The necklace was 16&#34; not 18&#34; but it fit (barely) so I kept it. I had an old one that I lost a while ago and once again I feel better when working out and seem to feel better between workouts....I just wish it was a bit longer. <end>  Perfect!  This neckalce came quickly and in it's original packaging, just as I was looking for. My daughter loves it! Thanks! <end>  Nice Necklace  Nice necklace, looks great and fits very nice; it has a very good quality.I dont know if this helps at all with pain but it's still a great product.Very fast delivery.Highly recommended. <end>  Present for brother  This is what my brother wanted for Christmas. He was very exctied to receive it! <end>  Doesn't work, but it looks good  In my opinion, this product doesn't work as advertised, but it looks good, so I really can't complain. I bought mine knowing that it most likely wasn't going to work, but I figured that if it did, it would be nice. It is simple looking, and can be tucked under any shirt. I wear mine everyday, and I have noticed no change. I would recommend this for someone who wants to try something new. <end>  stupid  this is a piece of crap i ordered my about 2 weeks ago and the only good thing about it was that it came about 2 days early which was good but the necklace broke the second day i got it. <end>  Great experience  Ordered this necklace for my son. He loves it! Got it just a few days after ordering it! Great experience! <end>  Looks good. Works like a pile of poo.  Yeah, so I was suckered into buying this product after seeing Josh "LIAR" Beckett wearing this during one of his pitching outings. Lemme just say THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP!!! No way does this thing relieve anything. I think its all in your head because when I first bought it I too believed it was working. But now MY BACK HURTS!!!! LIARS!!!! ARGH!!!PS Josh Beckett is currently injured...On the other hand, it does look nifty so if youre just buying it for the look then go for it. If not, go to an asian massage parlor or something. <end>  It works if you think it does!  Come on, people! If these products really worked, everyone would wear them! The manufacturers want you to think they work, so they can sell them and make $$$. I have tried the phiten, and the balance bracelet, and magnetic therapy. I have noticed no change in my myriad aches, pains, and stiffnesses. I have worn a phiten necklace for over a month, just to give it a chance. If anything, I feel worse with it on, so I am giving up. Save your money! <end>  Nonsense  This bracelet doesn't contain any "ions", "technology" nor "energy" which would noticeably affect the human body at all.Magic bracelets with different metals and magnets in them have been LONG PROVEN USELESS. Do you know who first debunked these things? *BENJAMIN* *FRANKLIN* did, two hundred years ago!He found out that it didn't matter whether he put metals or magnets or pieces of painted wood in them, people couldn't tell the difference. He told people they would increase strength, eliminate pain and cure all sorts of diseases with mysterious "energies". Of course it was nonsense but most people who bought them nevertheless claimed that they "worked".It's just a bracelet. No ions. No technology. No energy. No magic.Buy this bracelet only if you want to show the world that you don't have a clue. <end>  Who needs medicine?!?!  I bought this because I was very sick with no hope in sight, until someone recommended the Phiten Star Necklace. I put it on and instantly felt better. No more treatments for me! I threw all my meds out the window and got a ticket for littering but I no longer needed them is what I am trying to say.Not only that I was running faster, jumping higher, and could levitate. I have never had these abilities before but thanks to the Phiten Star Necklace I was like a super-human. Nevermind that this is just another new-age trend with tweens, and these do as much as you holding a marble in the fly of your underwear. These did so much it was amazing, and I promise it isn't just all in my head or your heads collectively. My friend saw what happened with me and wanted to one-up me, like always. So he read these have titanium in them and so he knew his Nike driver was made out of titanium too, so then he took it out of his golf bag and cut it off the shaft and wore it around his neck too. It was too much titanium and they don't expect him to make it through the end of the year.If you want to feel better and you KNOW it won't all be in your head, then you have to get this Phiten Star Necklace, it works (non)miracles! <end>  Broke within a few weeks  My necklace broke within a few weeks of purchase. (The bracelet I bought with it was too small. I wore it anyways, and it fell off within days and I lost it.) <end>  magnetic necklace  The necklace is unattractive and doesnt lay right on your neck. It's made of rope and magnets and the rope is too thick and twisted. I returned it asap.Phiten Star Necklace, Black, 22" <end>  Sizing of the 18 inch variation  It is 45 CM (17.7 inches), counting the clasp. Actual length when around your neck hovers at 17 inches.If that helps you with determining what size is for you, then I am glad to be of some help.Made out of comfortable material and I see no structural weaknesses.I didn't buy it for whatever hocus pocus it is trying to sell itself on, I just liked the style. <end>  This didn't make any difference  I thought this product was going to make a visible and evident difference in my performance (I play tennis). It did nothing for me. <end>  Great Buy!  Just as advertised and still in the original package half the price of the local sport shop! Shipped quickly! What a bargain! <end>  Fits just right  Unless you are a little guy I recommend the 22'' version of this. It isn't a choker and as far as it working... I really can't say. <end>  junk  After 2 days it broke. I contacted phiten and they told me since I didn't buy it from them I'm screwed. I was able to fix and improve it I like it. Just poor craftmanship <end>  Works fine  The product seems to be fine... I do notice a slight decrease in soreness while wearing this product. The only complaint I have as of right now is that the necklace is a bit stiff and wont lie flat around my neck. Tends to try and keep its oval shape. This may wear off in time. Great delivery time also. <end>  Very nice  I ordered this over night so it came fast. I love it. It fits perfect, seems to be good quality. I hope it helps with my aches, if not at least it looks good. <end>  In good condition, as promised...  The necklace was received in good condition, and appeared to be new. I gave it to my friend as a gift, and she was terribly excited. <end>  phiten titanium necklace  very happy with product and seller, item arrived when promised and in excellent condition...been wearing necklace for over a week now and seem to help.all in all, i would recommend this product and seller <end>  Worked out nicely for a gift.  My son gave it as a requested present. It worked out great. We have already gone back and purchased another for my youngest son as well, just a different color. <end>  I can't believe it but it really seems to work!  I bought this titanium necklace just to try one more alternative treatment for my joint pains and was really pleasantly surprised. It seems to be actually helping. I take tons of supplements and use magnets as well as the Q-ray ring/bracelet but this is the first item that seemed to immediately help decrease the pain in my joints. I'll have to see how it fairs as time goes by but if constantly wearing a rather ugly necklace is the price to pay, so be it. I can't say it'll help everyone who tries it but it definitely seems to be relieving my joint pains. Yehhhhh.....something that REALLY works!! <end>  These are great!  I had back pain for about a year. After seeing these necklaces being worn by a ton of Major League Baseball players I decided to give one of these a try. Next thing I knew, my back pain was gone. Coincidence? Maybe. But, when I forget to put it back on after a shower I sometimes feel pain again. These are very light weight and comfortable. Highly recommended. <end>  Fewer Aches and Pains  I am a chronic sufferer of back and neck pain. An accident several years ago left me with a fractured vertebrae and more pain than I know how to deal with. I watch a lot of baseball on TV and saw a lot of players wearing this and decided to give it a try. This product(along with a weekly workout regimen) has helped me deal with and exceed my own standards of pain tolerance. I don't know whether it's a mind-over-matter type of experience, but at this point, I don't really care. If you deal with aches and pains similar to these, I would definitely give this a try. <end>  it really works !!!  I've had gout for over 12 years and I constantly get flare ups on my right ankle. At times when my flare up was not as severe, i often would have minor ankle swells lasting all day. With a number of supplements taken such as black cherry fruit extract pills, glucosamine, NSAID's, and even acupuncture, i constanly had a slight swollen ankle that bothered me each day, especially in the evenings. Since watching the baseball players use it, I began reviewing the benefits of using this bracelet and heard from the BB players that it was helping them ease pain. I immediately thought of buying one for my dad since he always complained about his neck and how much it bothered him. Mind you that he is a welder who constantly shifts his welding hood downward with the use of his neck..figured that was the main reason why his neck hurt all the time. I bought this necklace and gave it to him and told him that the bracelet should help reduce is neck pain. Very kindly, my father acknowledged my statement as he placed it on his neck. Surprisingly, my dad called me two days later and said..."son, i couldn't wait to call you to tell you that the my neck pain is gone!!, and you are right! this thing helped my neck pain!" I was very glad to hear that...now here is my story. I got in Amazon and purchased one for me with the crazy idea of placing it on my ankle where my swelling occurs. My ankle measured 11 inches in diamater so i purchased the 22 inch phiten black bracelet. The day of arrival I opened the package and tied it on my ankle..perfect fit once double looped. Folks or readers..my swelling has gown down and my ankle pain went away!!!! Really...I can't believe that this bracelet served its purpose. Unbelievable! Now i can get up in the morning and not feel any pain in my foot. My evenings are much better than they every have been. i feel more energized throughout the day and feel great at night.I still take my cherry fruit extract pills, B complex, and Glucosomine supplements to help eliminate my uric acid in my body. i also take a teaspoon of baking soda to help neutralize the acid in the blood(kidney specialist referral).for those of you who have any joint pain, i suggest you try this bracelet and place it on the trouble areas. Of course it's impossible to find one long enough to fit around your waist, for those who have waist problems, but having one on your ankle, neck, and wrist will certainly help balance those energies overall.this is my story and felt it is worth sharingto those who are thinking whether or not this product works. I would gladly here anyone's testimonials about this bracelet. It truly works !!! <end>  Daily Relief  We wear these necklaces daily to aid with the wear & tear of daily work -- They help tremendously to ease any soreness and/or pain -- Highly recommend this product!!! <end>  It Works!  This Product really works, it helped relieve pain i have had for months and this is the only thing that has kept the pain away. Awesome product, i totally recommend this product to anyone with pain that doesnt go away with meds. <end>  Works for my shoulder  I've been wearing it for 3 weeks now. I have sciatic due to a herniated disc. I was hoping this will relieve pain. I guess it's not that powerful to wear it on the neck to get rid of the pain in my low back. I also got the bracelet which really works for my wrist, elbo and shoulder. Well, it's probably the combination of the necklace and bracelet that make them feel pretty much pain free. They are painful because I am a Programmer and work on the computer all day.I would say this product works. I may be buying the waist belt that is not sold here. <end>  Great product.  Got this for my husband, and he just loves it! Wears it every day. Helps prevent him from getting his headaches... <end>  Alternative Pain Relief  Both my husband and I use these to relieve our neck & shoulders of the pain from herniated discs. We wear them daily, and they do take the edge off. We have been using them for over two years now. <end>  Helps with pain from drumming  I'm a drummer who does a lot of session work and driving around to gigs who deals with chronic back and neck pain. I've been through chiro treatment and use all sorts of inversion tables, back rests, and braces to help deal with the pain of muscle stress and tension in my back and neck. Sometimes this pain spreads to my ribs and other areas so my pain simply comes from tense muscles, no disc compressions or anything like that. After buying this at a local sport shop and putting it on, I got into my car and slouched down into my seat (something I don't usually do because of the pain in my lower back) and drove to where I needed to be, not even realizing that my pain had went away. After wearing this necklace for a few days, I have stopped taking muscles relaxers at night, and I noticed while waking up I don't feel any tension. Usually waking up in the morning I feel the most tension but haven't had a problem for the past week. This morning while getting ready for work I was having some pain in my left ankle, and it was popping. I never have ankle pain and it never pops (must have tweaked it). Therefore, I took my necklace off and wrapped it around my ankle. 5 minutes later the pain was gone. I'm not sure how this product works, although I'm a firm believer in the bodies natural healing process. If this IS indeed placebo effect working, then what is the big issue? People should understand that placebo effect is a natural and very important process that can occur in our body. Western medicine spends time trying to get medication to work apart from the placebo effect, which is dangerous and a waste of time. I feel this product really does work and suggest it to anyone who wants to help themselves overcome pain with their body's natural healing process. Stop listening to other people's criticism and see if this product works for you. Your mind plays a bigger role in the success of this product than you think. That is all.... <end>  Nice necklace.  I don't know who the hell thinks this works, but it doesn't. Nice necklace though. I haven't stopped wearing it just because I don't have any other necklace to wear. <end>  Perfect Gift for 12 y/o Grandson  Our grandson wanted a Phiten necklace for his 12th birthday ... this was a last-minute purchase but it arrived even quicker than expected so it was here in time for his birthday. Sometimes it is hard to impress a tween ... this gift was warmly received and is worn every day. Now a younger grandchild is putting this item on her Christmas wish list. <end>  Not happy... Whatsoever.  Very, very, very dissatisfied with this order... NOT the correct size. NOT the item pictured. Not the item titled. Says 18", but it came as 22". I have a small neck... However, it shipped/arrived extremely quickly. ONLY good thing about ordering this item. I could have gotten pretty much the SAME EXACT item for $4.99 from another seller on Amazon. Stole $10 from me. <end>  Atleast it looks cool!  Well, I got what I ordered. Does it work for me? No. Besides wearing it as a fashion item this necklace serves no other purpose. If you are having pains in your body try stretching or heading to the gym. I promise that will work better than some gimmick. <end>  It works!  I thought that was bunk and I laughed when my husband bought, especially since I'm the one that has had chronic back and neck pain for the last 3 years - 2 of the years of consistent chiropractic work at least 3 times a week. We recently moved and things improved drastically with only the occasional neck pain, I'm assuming from less stress, then this morning I woke up with a killer headache and could barely move my head from the stiffness and pain in my neck. I took my husbands necklace and laid in bed, after dozing off for an hour I woke up and things were 90% better. I then cracked my neck and we were at 98% I took the necklace off long enough to take a shower and by the time I got out my neck was locking up again so I put it on for the remainder of the day until my husband got home. I'm ordering mine asap, it was enough to convince me - although I *hate* the look, clashes with all my clothing except my running stuff. Based on another persons review, I am eager to try it on my ankle, I too have a bad ankle from a severe sprain a few years ago - I bet this will help for sure! This product rocks. <end>  Pseudoscience voodoo. Check wikipedia  I can't believe there are so many gullible people out there. These necklaces don't actually do anything. Look up phiten and pseudoscience.Like David Hannum said, "There's a sucker born every minute." <end>  Trendy Necklace  I'm not sure if I bought this for my 13 year old son or 19 year old nephew. However, it doesn't matter because both of them love their necklaces. <end>  A Gimmick  Bought the 22 inch Navy Blue one. Should have bought a longer one as it can still be seen when I wear formal shirts at work.More importantly, I dont see any benefits with wearing this.I will give it a couple of more weeks and if I still see no benefits, I will write it off as one of my many frivolous purchases. <end>  Great  I bought it for my boyfriend and sent it as a gift.He loved it, and still wears it to this day.It's comfortable and fits with the outfits he wears.=) <end>  Outstanding  I bought these for my grandchildren. All the kids at their school has one or would like to get one. They are very nice and I would recommend this to all your children or grandchildren. My grandchildren only takes there's off to take a bath. They were at a Christmas get together and the kids there wanted to know how they could get one and my daughter-in-law called to find out so they could order some for their children.I think Amazon is great as I only have to wait a couple of days and I have my product I ordered, plus Amazon products you do not have shipping charges.Kay J., North Carolina <end>  Recommended for computer / internet / game addicts.  If you sit before computer for more than 8 hours a day & you have lack of excercise then this product is for you.This tech is invented in Japan & this product is made in Japan, So you can trust its quality. <end>  Very Pleased.  I bought this item, because I always see Boston Red Sox players wear them and thought they looked cool. It is cool, and it does relieve some minor aches and pains that I have/had. I recommend getting one for yourself, if you want to be cool like me. <end>  GIVES ME POWER  THIS NECKLACE GIVES ME POWER!!! No seriously it's just a blue necklace that I only bought because Josh Beckett wears them. GO SOX! <end>  Necklace  I bought this as a gift for a niece. She told me that she liked it a lot and so did her friends. <end>  It looks cool!  Aside from the "coolness" factor for my teenage baseball player son, I'm not sure what else there is to say about the article. He is certainly thrilled with it. His tournament team were all wearing them at Sunday's tournament and they won the championship! <end>  necklace  Was pleased with the timely receipt of the necklace and it came in excellent shape. <end>  cool necklace, doesn't work though  You probably saw some baseball players wearing this necklace and are curious. Does it work as advertised? Nah. It looks cool and I enjoy wearing it, but it does nothing for pain or tension or stiffness, etc. I know it's very popular in baseball (I myself work for MLB) but at the same time, baseball players are very superstitious, and considering these come in various colors and can be braided, it's not surprising to see them everywhere. I do like mine a lot, though. I'd recommend tossing it in with your clothes to be washed once in a while, especially if you workout or sweat, or even if you shower with it on -- it really does need to be cleaned thoroughly to remove that built-up sweaty smell. Cheaper here on Amazon than in sporting good stores. <end>  not what I expected  I have the wrist phiten and it works great. I expected tension relieve in my neck but got more from wearing this neck one. They might be fakes. Buyer beware and check things out. <end>  Sorry, little improvement here.  I wore this for approximately 2 months, and hardly noticed any change. Maybe, I need to wear it longer, but I have noticed almost no improvement with my back pain. <end>  Great product  Great product at an awsome price. Cannot buy them local for that. Kids love them. <end>  love it!  Love this! I just wish I would have measured before I bought because it is a bit big! Would highly recommend this to anyone who is active and needs some reflief from the day to day aches and pains. <end>  Back pain is gone  I've got to say that I just love my Phiten neckace. I've suffered from mild scoliosis since I can remember, so sitting for long periods of time always gave me a bit of lower back pain. I haven't had such pain since I started to use this product. I wear it everyday, not only for sports. <end>  It actually works!  I was skeptical at first but after wearing this since Christmas, I've noticed my neck and shoulder area is noticeably looser and I've been getting some colossal cracks in my neck. I work my upper body area in the gym and at home with various chest and shoulder exercises and I've found this helps take some of the post workout stiffness away. Would recommend to a friend. <end>  Good Response  Purchased this for my son. He loves it as it it the fad among his peers. The order arrived quickly from the seller. <end>  Good purchase for teenage son  I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my teenage son. He had asked for one and after comparing several in the price range I wanted to spend, I decided on this. It looks good and he says it works for him. I would recommend this as a trial piece to decide if it works for you before purchasing one that is more expensive. <end>  Can you feel the heat too?  This is another product I bought along with a power balance bracelet in preparation for the honolulu marathon. A coworker of mine swears by this so I decided to try it out for one as soon as you put it on a slight heat surrounds your neck and you can feel something working. In general I feel better when I have it on so if it works for me it might work for you. Good luck <end>  awesome necklace!!!  While watching the baseball playoffs this fall, I couldn't help but notice the necklaces the majority of players were wearing. Looked them up and here it is. Although this specific one wasn't the one I wanted, it works for now. Not only does it make me more powerful and nearly invincible, it also allows me to be pain free!In all seriousness, these necklaces are kind of cool, save for the original nagging from the girlfriend about it looking dumb. They're marketed to help reduce pain in the neck and shoulder area, which is fine if you believe in non-traditional medicine. Since I work in the medical field, I don't buy into this marketing gimmick.Now, if these necklaces combined the amazing therapeutic effects of titanium, copper AND magnets, HOLY CRAP, WATCH OUT.Cool looking necklace, but if you're buying it for anything other than the look, you're not too smart. <end>  Worth the money  My son loves this necklace. He has asked for more Phi-tens for Christmas. Good quality and doesn't fade. <end>  Love this product  I like this product, wearing it for 5 years and I truly believe it functions well. <end>  My kid loves this necklace  He hasn't taken it off since he got it. He is 11 and it is a fad at his school. They have these in one of the sporting goods stores here but they are $30 and up- and I couldn't see paying that much for a necklace for a kid. So we ordered this one instead. It is durable, the colors are nice and bright, and my son seems very happy with it. <end>  Phiten Titanium Necklace  I'v had this necklace for over a month now. I have had constant knee pain for 2 years . This product actually works. My knee pain is almost non existent. I also have a bad back. It has lessened that pain some what, but not totally . I would highly recommend this product. <end>  wish design were sharper  Photo leads one to believe the design is much sharper than it actually turns out to be. <end>  this works  PHITEN AQUA-TITANIUM NECKLACE bought one on a whim and it really works.no more neck pains in the a.m. and it looks pretty cool.just gotta remember to take it off before the shower it doesn't dry too quick!! <end>  Briefing on Phiten Titanium Necklace  Well... actually it looks really cool.. so cool that my friends are asking me to buy some more of this product for them.Regarding the effect on me, I could tell that it really works. I'm a baseball player and I haven't felt any particular pain in my body since I started wearing it!!! <end>  Feeling Great!  I but this just for what was said about it, and I have to admit, because a lot of MLB players use it, I figured, if they use it then it has to work, since I bought it and started wearing it I have not taken it off and my head, shoulders and neck feel great. <end>  Phiten Star Necklace  This necklace was for my two boys that play baseball. They really like the style and they even said it gave them energy. If it helps them in the mental aspect of their game then it the right product. I like the looks and the feel. It is soft and attractive looking. The boys wear it all the time. <end>  Orange  I ordered an Orange Phiten necklace for my kid. He loves these things, and it arrived right on time. The quality is just what was expected. The kid wears it every day. <end>  Super Fast shipping!!! Would order again  Recieved fast free shipping on Phiten necklace. Excellent price! This company provided a great product with no issues. <end>  These are great!  I don't know why I didn't get one of these earlier. I was sure if it would really work, but after trying it there is no way I will ever play a sport without wearing this! <end>  Great  This was a good item for the price...i cant really say that it is a miracle worker but it does feel pretty solid and good. if you end up not liking the way it works than its still a cool necklace to have for the price. <end>  Good  I buy them for my parents. They look good, and my parents like them. Hope they will work as they said. <end>  good necklace  It was very good quality. The clasp is kind of hard to open. Get the smaller size for kids. Size 22 was way too big. It hangs down more than I wanted. <end>  The item is good but...  I ordered two 18" but received a 18" and a 22", obviously I can't wear the 22" one. I'm an international buyer so it's a bit expensive to return this item, however, I donated the 22" one to a local charity sale. Since I can't wear this necklace myself I'm not sure if it works well, so this 3-star rating is given to the seller, for shipping a wrong item. <end>  great  Little neice requested this for CHristmas. She loves it. Little pricey but I guess this is the new trend for the young folks. <end>  Great buy  I purchased this for my husband. I found one in my town for 10.00 more, exact same product so this one is a steal! He liked it and has had no complaints, although the 18" seems to be a bit smaller than that, maybe due to the thickness of the weave around the titanium wire. Good buy. <end>  Phiten Star Shines  I've done a little research on this type of product; the reports show mixed results. The necklace might be a placebo, but it keeps me aware and, therefore, works for me! <end>  What I was hoping for...  I purchased this necklace in hopes that some of my daily aches and pains would lessen; I am still a skeptic by heart, and hoping that all my aforementioned A&P;'s would completely be eradicated by the wearing of this necklace seems,well,silly.It is comfortable to wear (although I do wish I had chose the next size longer for appearance sake.) and not at all heavy.All in all, I would recommend buying this piece to anyone who wants to give it a chance. If I am able to do cartwheels in a few months, I'll report back to let you know. <end>  I wish I could tell if it works  I bought this mostly because I thought it looks cool. I wasn't expecting much to happen otherwise. I wear it when I work out, and it could be improving my stability and strength, but I can't tell whether or not it works.If you are buying this as a miracle cure, I would caution against it, but if you like the look of it then get it. <end>  Phiten Star Necklace  I absolutely love the Phiten Star Necklace. It's comfortable, practical, stylish, and everything listed in the product description. I would recommend this product to everyone. <end>  Pretty but no special effect  This was a present for my sister-in-law, who specifically requested it, hoping that it would somehow give her energy. It hasn't, but she still thinks it's pretty. <end>  Great  I love this it works too. I can feel it getting rid of my cramps and during practice I feel I have more energy and I am able to run harder. It really helps the joints too. <end>  Phiten necklace 22"  It is comfortable and stylish but that is not why I bought it. I have neck problems and was looking for relief from low grade pain that often shows up. It seems to help although it is hard to tell with these things. Nothing scientific but I truly think it reduces and sometimes eliminates the mild pain I have had intermittently for a long time. There may even be a slight energy boost but that is minimal for me. <end>  Really Works!  I have had two back surgeries and am usually in constant pain but once I put this on and kept it on for more than a week it really helped out my lower back pain. Don't get me wrong, this is not a miracle necklace in any way but it did greatly reduce the pain for a while. Once I had to take it off to go back to work (military), I noticed the back pain came back quickly. It made me fill a bit more energetic during the day and is easy to conceal under a t-shirt if you don't want people to ask a lot of questions (I would suggest 22" or larger). Great product...I plan on buying the wrist bracelet next. <end>  For Whatever Reason, My Joints Feel Better  I don't know how this thing works or if it's psychological or just plain coincidence, but my joints feel 100% better since I started wearing this necklace. I had a sore shoulder and sore knees, and since I started wearing this they feel great. If you have joint pain it's well worth plunking down $20 to try one of these necklaces! <end>  Works well, but no miracle  So, my ankle has suffered for about 10 years or so. I have worn a goofy flat shoe that doesn't flex before. I got the necklace and double wrapped around my ankle. It started to feel strange(kinda warm) at first. My first thought was"oh great my brain thinks it is doing something". After a while of not thinking or noticing it, i could walk upstairs without my ankle hurting. I am a sceptic, so i took it off for a few days. My ankle hurt again while walking upstairs. This is NOT a cure. When the weather changes like rain/cold, still hurts a bit. I got the cheapest one possible, but i am going to try the better one. While it does help, do NOT expect a miracle. It can help to reduce pain if double wrapped around wrist or ankle, but not a cure by any stretch. I like the product, but will have to get one of the braided ones to see more. <end>  Good Buy!  Was very pleased to find what my daughter wanted on Amazon again! She got this for a Christmas gift. It was perfect! Thanks Amazon! <end>  Phiten Star Necklace  Necklace is fine and it arrived on time and in good condition. It has helped me somewhat with the stiffness I have had in my neck. I will not say that it has gone completely, but I think it is helping me to get around better. <end>  great necklace---even better price  very happy with this necklace. i bought this for my daughter who wanted one cause they were the latest craze among all her jr high friends. got this one because it was the best price i could find. extremely satisfied. <end>  My 11 year old son loves his Necklace!  Yes this is the latest trend for Baseball Players (young and old)...and my son had to have one! He wanted the Navy one...and absolutely loves it! Great quality...and after over a month of wearing it every day...still looks brand new! <end>  An incredible pain reducer!  I have had this necklace for over a month now, and I have been using it constantly. I am in chronic pain some of witch is in my face and neck. And I have been using very strong magnets to help. But I find this product to be extremely effective at reducing and many times eliminating the pain. It does better than the magnets; and it even helps me sleep better than I have in years.I cannot say enough about this product, because it really works. I just bought the wristbands to help with the pain in my hands and arms. Also one for my wife she finds it helps with her headaches.I learned about this from watching professional baseball, and seeing that most of the players are using it to help with relaxing and their pain. Now I see why they are all using it. <end>
 B000FOJCRI  Southwestern Style Animal Track ( Raccoon, Moose, Mountain Lion, Coyote, Beaver, Gray Wolf and Bear ) Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 11 1/2, #11873 ||	  beautiful  This ring is just exactly as it's pictured, and simply gorgeous -- and Taos Trading's customer service  fantastic. Highly recommended. . . . <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I love this ring... I love wildlife especially wolves and to have their tracks in turquoise on a beautiful sterling silver ring is awesome. You can't go wrong with this one! <end>
 B000FOUQFU  NCAA Missouri Tigers 50-Inch-by-60-Inch Micro Raschel Throw "Property Of" Design ||	  Warm and Comfy  A great blanket for all Mizzou fans..it looks great, feels great, and keeps you warm all at the same time. Take it to the stadium for a cold game, to a camping trip, or just to have on your bed during winter. A great practical gift for you or a friend (and well worth the money). <end>
 B000FOVKL4  'Shapely' Flying Spaghetti Monster Lapel Pin - bright silver finish ||	  A funny way to start a conversation  Since I wear my new FSM lapel pin, I've had several nice opportunities to explain what it is, and what it means wearing it. Of course, in several occasions I've been asked further and I've been able to explain my points of view concerning religion. As an European citizen, I'm (almost) always welcome when I introduce myself as an atheist. <end>

 B000FPFC58  Classic Dime Shell Collar Necklace [Clearance] ||	  too complicated  This necklace actually uses a lot of materials, but it is way too much for someone as petite as I am. It occupied too much area and it looked cheap. <end>
 B000FPHGY8  Turquoise Blue Medallion Necklace ||	  light and pretty  this lightweight necklace makes a very pretty statement..it adds just the right 'punch' to any solid basic colored ensemble... <end>  beautiful looking, but lacking in quality  I ordered three necklaces and paid $4.99 each plus shipping. This one arrived with a broken claw clasp. I can repair it, but was disappointed at the lack of quality. <end>
 B000FPIQ2E  PalmBeach Jewelry Multi-Gem Silver Flower Ring ||	  Beautiful ring but very delicate  I bought the ring and it was even larger than I expected it would be. It is approximately 1 1/4 inches high, 1 inch wide, and 1 1/4 inches length. The flowers are beautifully carved, and look beautiful. After wearing it once, one of the flowers on the far edge fell off. After wearing it 3 times, one of the flowers on another edge cracked in half. Since none fell off the middle, the ring still looks beautiful. However, you must be very careful with it, especially with its size. I would not recommend this ring for people with smaller fingers since the width of the ring will be wider than the width of your finger. I still gave it 3 stars because I love the delicate details and how beautiful it is. Just be gentle with it. <end>
 B000FPKJLU  PalmBeach Jewelry Sim. Turquoise Silver Ring, Sizes 7-12 ||	  Disappointed  A little dsappointed in the quality of this ring. Doesn't look half as nice in person as it does in the catalog. <end>
 B000FPKMDK  PalmBeach Jewelry 18k Yellow Gold over Sterling Silver Puzzle Ring ||	  Don't Be Fooled  The 18K gold 'paint' wears off within a week or two. I have this ring and parts are goldish and the rest is silver, now. Not worth the price tag. I would recommend buying a silver ring. <end>  nice but big  Ring was far bigger than hoped. Wrong size shipped. Great return service. Good seller. Fast shipping . Would do business with again. Puzzle was easy to put together after watching video on how to do it. <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring is every bit as lovely in reality as it appears in its photo. And the puzzle pieces work perfectly. Definitely worth the price!The ONLY downside is that the instructions they provide regarding how to actually do the puzzle are very confusing if you've never had or seen a puzzle ring before because there are no diagrams. I suggest searching for the solution online instead so you can put it back together after you take it apart... because you know you will. ;) <end>  It comes apart  I did not realize that this is actually four rings intertwined. My wife loved it, but after a month, she was fiddling with it and the rings came apart. It came with directions to reassemble it, but they are far from clear. After half an hour we got it back together. It's not that hard once you figure out how to do it. Better descriptions of the individual rings in the instructions would help. <end>  excellent  thank you so much for your prompt service. Package was received promptly and with no damages. I will continue to view your site for future purchase. <end>
 B000FPLQJE  1 7/8 TCW Oval-Cut Genuine Blue Sapphire and Diamond Accent 18k Gold over Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Chnges color  Looks worst than the picture. I bought it for an ex and it matches her personality, dull and forever changing. <end>

Amazing service and quick shipping. Very customer friendly - what else could you ask for? <end>  great purchase  I've got this ring for my future husband and I liked it so much. Since he can't wear gold this is a very good option! Besides it looks very nice and would say looks like it's not a silver but white gold! Definitely I would recommend to buy this ring! Also the Seller send us a pretty little gift and the catalogue which was very nice as well! <end>  I returned it.  I was very disappointed when this product came. I opened the box and hated it. The stones are tiny and cloudy. The settings that hold the stones are brighter than the stones themselves. Picture looks great, but doesn't look like that when it comes. Also it was very uncomfortable on the sides of my finger, it juts out on the sides. <end>  Very Pleased  Very pleased with this product. It is just as described and arrived in a timely manner. Good busines <end>

 B000FRVZY8  Sterling Silver 1.10mm Box Chain Necklace Available in Sizes 7, 8, 9, 16, 18, 20, 24, and 30 Inches) ||	  one of the worse chains I ever baught  I bought this chain, because my last 18" chain broke. I wore it for about 2 days. ended up with a painful rash. After the rash went away, tried it on. 3 minutes later It felt like it was burning my skin so I riped it off.Its a good looking chain, even though it a inexpensive chain don't buy it.Expecialy if you are like me, are allergic to nickle.

 B000FSCTBA  Sterling Silver Oval Shaped Prayer Box with Star of David ||	  Beautiful necklace  I bought this as a Christmas present and was very happy at the quality. The chain is perfect for the pendant, and the pendant is well made. The only slight drawback is that the catch on the pendant isn't very sturdy. Anything you put in the pendant needs to fit almost perfectly, the catch isn't strong enough to hold something in that is pushing against it. Example... I printed a very small photo to put inside for my mom. It was a little too big and pushed just enough against the catch that it wouldn't stay closed. Solution... print a smaller picture. lol <end>  Clasp non-functional after two wears  I've worn this pendant twice. Today I took it out of my jewelry box and found that the clasp did not hold it closed. I'm sure I can get it fixed, but for $65, I expect better workmanship. <end>
 B000FSFL24  14kt Gold Link Bracelet with Blue Agate Cameo Charm - 1/2" X 3/8" ||	  Gold link bracelet with cameo charm  I was a little disappointed in the quality of the gold bracelet, it is very light weight and the cameo charm is very small. It looked larger and of a higher quality in the picture. I believe it is overpriced for the quality. <end>
 B000FSFL56  14k 2-Tone Satin & Shiny Gemstone Bracelet - 7" ||	  Netaya - Two-tone multigem bracelet  I was disappointed with the bracelet - it was too light and not as depicted in the picture.

 B000FSFMD2  14K White Gold Sapphire & Diamond Baby Shoe Pendant ||	  Absolutely stunning!  I bought this item when I had our first son, 4 years ago. And now we have one more boy, so this pendant is not going anywhere! Lots of compliments, such a beautiful piece of jewelry. Also, it is very heavy - so much value for such a great price! <end>  Baby Shoe Pendant  Beautiful and sophisticated pendant. Elegant and gorgeous is what describes this. Many, many compliments on this everytime I wear it! Worth every penny. <end>  I LOVE IT  It is absolutely beautiful! It is amazing in person. Not only do I like this bootie better then the other ones out there, but it is also less expensive. It looks like a designer piece of jewelry, well it kinda is. I always get complements on it. <end>  Absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry  This was a gift for my wife from our newborn son and she can't take it off. <end>

 B000FSHHPI  14K Yellow Gold Sapphire Butterfly Pendant w/ 18" Box Chain ||	  Michael  The chain is garbage. Broke within seconds after opening the box. Pendant is perfect. Small but all jewelry is smaller than you think it will be.  PStones are a tiny bit lighter than I wanted but She loved them as is, so thats not an issue that matters.I recommend the item for a man that wants something very nice but also a little different form the usual fair.Also, it doesn't break the bank.  )Would have been 4 to 5 stars if the chain had not been so substandard. <end>  Saphire necklace  A beautiful butterfly sapphire necklace with diamond accent on a gold chain. Price was excellent and received a $25 discount on the order. Perfect gift for that special someone in your life. Received on time and extremely well packaged, including a leather display case. <end>
 B000FSHJ38  14K Diamond Heart Pendant w/ Chain - 18" ||	  Very Dissapointed  I was out of town and ordered it for my wife on line. When I was able to see it I was totally shocked how small it was. The picture over stated its size. <end>
 B000FSHJ42  14K Cat Pendant w/ 18" Rope Chain ||	  Pendant is nice; Chain is a rip-off  I am really disgusted with the Cat Pendant that arrived today. I bought it as a gift for someone else, and there is no time to return it and get a replacement before Christmas. The open-work cat pendant is really cute and nicely done, but the chain that it floats on is about as thin as a hair. It would break if someone sneezed on it. When I see something described as a "rope chain" I think of something a little more substantial.The necklace arrived in a box wrapped around a slotted, folded envelope stuffed with tissue paper and cushioned with a tiny scrap of bubblewrap. In other words, if you buy this necklace, you will also need to purchase another gift box to present it in because the one that came with the necklace looks like trash.I am really angry to have paid $45 for what was probably worth only $15. <end>
 B000FSHK0A  Sterling Silver 9MM Greek Key Bracelet - 8" ||	  great  i have had this bracelet for about two years. it is as pretty today as when i first received it. this bracelet is a great buy. really nice <end>
 B000FSJ1F2  Sterling Silver Beaded Necklace 17 ||	  Netaya products are great!  I have purchased several items from Netaya and not only are the products first rate but the packaging and customer service are excellent. <end>  so nice, ordered a second one  So nice, ordered a second one. So nice, ordered a second one. So nice, ordered a second one.Good quality and value. <end>  silver beads  I thought this would be a necklace with larger beads in the middle, and smaller beads towards the end. Alas, all the beads are the same. Even tho it has beads all the same size, it is a fine necklace and I am glad I bought it. It looks very nice and has been a fun necklace to wear. I MUST get in and check to see what other goodies this company has to offer! <end>
 B000FSJ1MU  14K 1/4 Carat Diamond Solitaire Pendant w/18" Chain ||	  Good value  It is at such a great price. The diamond is not a nice color but the necklace looks really good anyway. <end>
 B000FSJ32I  Sterling Silver Scalloped Pendant with 17" Leather Cord ||	  Great Necklace  I purchased 2 necklaces at the same time both looking to be of the same size. When I got them one was way smaller than this one. This one is a great size a larger piece of jewelary and is fabulious if you like larger pieces. <end>
 B000FSMZHI  10K White Gold Fancy Diamond Cut Pendant w/ Twisted Chain - 17" ||	  very good purchase  i purchased this necklace few month back and I gotta say i love it, I purchased again as a gift for my friend as well and she loved it. for my self I also got the matching earrings which look great together, very happy with the purchase very happy with the seller, shipment was very fast and good, I would definately purchase again and again from this seller... <end>
 B000FSN0JK  14k Yellow Gold 1.00 ctw. Diamond Ring - Size 7 ||	  Beautiful ring for the price  I purchased this ring for my wife. The diamonds are of much better quality than I was expecting. There seem to be VERY LITTLE inclusions and the stones seem to be very near colorless. The way the stones are set make the ring look like more than 1 CTTW.I got a great deal for this ring on a Friday sale with free shipping and $25 off from Netaya. <end>  good price  this is not a bad ring for the price at all. of course, for this kind of price, the diamonds are not the best quality, but inclusions are not obviously noticeable by naked eyes. the setting is also of good value. very good overall. <end>  Worse than expected...  I did not expect much for the price, but was nevertheless disappointed.There were quite large visible inclusions (esp. in the main stone and in one of the side stones) which allowed only a few light reflections within the stones (large parts of the stones looked simply "blind").In addition, the gold ring was shaped uneven and asymmetrical.Maybe I just got a really bad one...I would not feel comfortable giving this ring to anyone, so I returned it (bought a smaller one with cleaner stones and a whole lot more sparkle). <end>
 B000FSUEVW  Cable Chain Necklace Sterling Silver 2.00mm (Available in Different Sizes) ||	  Great Product  I use this chain to hold my engagement ring when I can't wear it on my hand. It is very sturdy and surprisingly attractive with a very shiny finish. The clasp is a little difficult to use though. <end>  Sterling Necklace  The necklace was nice quality and length. Will easily accommodate the charms and holder intended for use with it. Description accurate,arrived promptly,reliable seller. <end>  Gorgeous necklace!  I bought this necklace to hold up a cluster of charms that I was putting together and it worked out perfectly. The chain is very shiny and looks expensive, not cheap. I guarantee that it is a good price online because any sterling store within the local shopping mall sells these types of chains for thirty dollars and up. What I loved most about this chain is that it isn't too thick, but not tiny like some of the 1mm box chains tend to be. It is substantial enough to hold 3 charms, but not thick making it look gumball machine cheap. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I'm not satisfied with the clasp. The lobster clasp itself was fine, but this nice chain is finished off with a tiny jumpring that is much too wide to accommodate certain charms. I had to bend it a bit with pliers to get my bunny charm to go on and I wasn't all too happy to have to do that. Having the tiny jumpring also makes it harder to clasp the necklace together and hard to put on by yourself. Overall it is a nice necklace and I guess if the jumpring bugs me too much, I can always go to a jewelry supply store and fix it up. <end>
 B000FSUF20  Sterling Silver 1.00mm Mirror Box Chain Necklace Italian (Available in Sizes 16, 18, 20, 24, and 30 Inches) ||	  Just ok  I was so excited that there was a sterling silver box chain for the price that I received it at. Well everyone is always saying if it seems too good to be true it probably is....well I think that this necklace is just that. It is mirrored so it is shiny but that is about all that it is good about it. I love box chains because they are stronger than just a plain linked chain but all of my other chains are fluid and move very nicely around my neck. This one is so extremely rigid that I have yet to wear it for fear of it snapping and then the possibility that the pendent that is on it will be lost.It is not so bad as to send it back for the money that I spent on it but like I said I have yet to bring myself to wear it. <end>
 B000FU8A3O  Sterling Silver Enamel Magical Phoenix Bird Earrings ||	  She wears them everyday!  My best friend loves these earrings, which I purchased as a Christmas present for her. They are beautiful , and a great gift. <end>  Works for me!  I love these earrings. The colors are very vivid and work well with my blue outfits. I've worn them all summer. Very lightweight. Won't pull down your earlobes. <end>
 B000FUACCQ  Sterling Silver Synthetic Garnet Red CZ Eternity Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  beautiful ring but was very uncomfortable  I was so excited when I first saw this and when I received it and tried to wear it, it just was not a ring I felt I could wear for any length of time as it seemed to dig in the fingers. May not be putting this right but I was unhappy with it. <end>
 B000FW2MEK  Stainless Steel Oval Bangle for Women, 7 inch ||	  Perfect for young or petite girl  First let me say that the quality of this bracelet is fantastic and that it is a very strong material that does not fade or bend easily. It has a nice little "snap" feature that is strong enough to keep the bracelet from accidentally opening, but still is fairly easy to get off.That being said, I am a tall girl and have larger wrists. My wrist is 6 1/2" inches around at the widest point (over the bone). So I do wish the bracelet was just a LITTLE bit bigger. I can wear the bracelet comfortably, but it is not a "bangle" meaning it does not slide up and down my arm at all. I am still giving it 4 stars because it is such a beautiful quality piece of jewelry and would fit as a bangle on smaller, petite wrists (teens, etc.).The bracelet could probably be engraved easily on the inside or outside due to the design and material. It should be noted that the entire bracelet is polished (not matte). In the photo, it appears to be brushed aluminum look. In fact, the entire bracelet is polished surgical steel. The bracelet is also solid metal (not hollow or plated).I am sure this bracelet will last me a long time and so far it has no scratches and wears nicely. The squared-off shape makes it more modern. I highly recommend. <end>
 B000FXR6A4  Diamond-Cut Starburst Black Onyx, Agate, and Jade Beaded Sterling Silver Necklace - 18" ||	  silver & black onyx necklace  This is a very beautiful necklace and it will never tarnish!!! I love it so much, I just wish it came in other colored stones! <end>
 B000FXSQ1C  Barbed Wire Print Pewter Ring ||	  Very Cool Ring  Very cool ring, I love it. Very nice workmanship. Even better than the picture. Thanks, Tim A. <end>
 B000FXUS6S  AugustinaJewelry Freshwater Cultured Round Shape 7-7.5mm White Pearl Pendant, 16" Sterling Silver 1MM Cable Chain ||	  As expected  The product was exactly as described. The pearl was perfectly round and large. The recipient, 16 year old girl, absolutely loved it. She layers it with a full strand necklace of the same size pearls. <end>  Pearl was okay, chain was not  I ordered these necklaces as a gift for my bridesmaids. When they arrived, the pearl looked nice, but I immediately noticed that for all three necklaces I ordered, the chains were discolored in several locations. It was pretty obvious to the point that I didn't feel I could give them as a gift as they were. I even tried using a jewerly cleaner to remove the brownish discolorations, but it didn't help. I'm wondering if it's really a sterling silver chain as advertised... <end>  Beautiful pendant - perfect June birthday gift  I ordered this pendant for my sister for her June birthday. It's a high quality pearl - especially for the price. The chain that came with it was very thin and fragile, so I would recommend ordering a heftier chain to go with this. The pendant is very sophisticated looking and very feminine in its simple elegance. It would look just as good with Jeans and a tank as it would with a wedding dress. My sister loves it! <end>  Necklace rusted!  I bought this to give to my bridesmaids a few months in advance. It looked ok when it first arrived but then a few wks later the necklace part rusted and tarnished and I haven't even given them yet to the bridesmaids. Total waste of money~! <end>  doesn't hold up  Gave this necklace as a gift for Christmas. My friend was wearing the necklace recently and realized the pearl had fallen off the mount. <end>
 B000FXVZTW  Trumpet Instrument Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Never received it  I ordered this, but got something totally different in the mail. They credited me and I sent the jewelry back but told them I still wanted the trumpet necklace. Never received it. <end>  Good, Cheap Trumpet Necklace  Trumpet comes as described and looks exactly like the picture. It is fairly light and about 3-4cm in length. The details are best described as cartoonish.The pendant comes attached to a cheap, black rope necklace band. It is probably best to replace with a chain or something that doesn't risk coming undone. Also included is a black drawstring bag to store the pendant in.This would make a perfect gift for a trumpet enthusiast without breaking the budget. Most other sterling silver pendents cost twice as much or more. <end>
 B000FXXRSO  Microphone & Notes Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  great necklace  My son loved this necklace... It was bold and looked exactly like the picture. Fast shipping and I wish you had a drumset, drum sticks or something for a drummer. Would buy from you again... Thanks <end>  i like it  on that price i can say it ok, i think im happy about it, not exactly what i expect, but still happy. thanks to the seller <end>
 B000FZ3UEI  Green Enamel Irish Shamrock 3-Leaf Clover Sterling Silver Bracelet 7" ||	  Extremely disappointed  I received this as a birthday gift. I saw the bracelet online and sent the link to my parents as a suggestion. Couldn't have been more disappointed when I opened it. Extremely tiny and lightweight. I feel terrible my parents paid so much money for this trinket. I'm hoping for a refund, just feel too guilty wearing it. <end>  loved it  Purchased this to complement the shamrock necklace and earings that were a gift for my wife. She loves all three pieces. <end>  Disappointing  I ordered this gift for a friend of mine for her birthday and I was disappointed. It is TINY! It doesn't look that way to me in the pictures. Honestly, if I didn't know any better I would bet it didn't cost more than $20-$25 tops. It's pretty but not good value at all for the money. <end>
 B000FZ3UGQ  Sterling Silver Celtic Trinity Knot Heart Ring(Sizes 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  beautiful legitimate celtic knots  The ring fits perfectly, it is simple and elegant, so it goes with everything. The Celtic knots are beautiful and the design is unique. I am a huge fan of Celtic and Irish jewelry and I am very pleased! Be sure to use a silver cleaner and to clean in the crevices. Its wonderful. <end>  Amazing ring!!!!!!  This ring is absolutely goregous! I bought two of these rings back in January as purity rings for my sister and I. It looks large and rather bulky in the picture, but its the perfect size. I love Silver Insanity because I wear a size 10 ring, and they seem to have my size on most rings unlike many other brands. I would deffinately recomend this ring to any woman, any age. I wear this ring everyday! The only con would be the packaging... There's no ring box, instead a little fuzzy bag. Worth buying!!! <end>  I love this ring.  I wear this everyday! It is definitely my favourite silver ring.  D It is sooo cute! Fits perfectly too! The company that makes it also sent it with a cute little bag for it. <end>  My perfect ring  I'm not the person who wear rings or buy them online especially, but when I saw this one, I thought, I must have it. Ring was shipped very quickly. And it is just perfect, you can wear it with anything. It has a very nice design and quality. It looks very delicate and absolutely beautiful. I'm very happy that I bought it!!! <end>  great stuff  got my ring very quickly and was in mint condition. would definately buy from seller again <end>  Very Pretty; Great Price  This ring is very pretty. Seems like the size runs a little small, but other reviews had said that so I ordered one size up and it's great.For those complaining about tarnish, remember that it's silver and needs to be polished as such. I have a few pieces from Silpada (which you may know is VERY expensive for what it is, not close to worth it in my book!) and those tarnish as well and have to be polished.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. <end>  Beautiful  I gave this ring to my sister in law for christmas. She is 19 and every year I always look for something special to give to her that is just from me. I ordered this ring and was surprised with how nice it actually was when it arrived. My sister inlaw has not taken it off since. She has even referenced the gift on more then one occasion. Definately worth the money to anyone thinking about buying it. <end>  Celtic Design combines heart and triquetra  This ring is lovely and lets you wear the meaningful symbols woven into it in gleaming silver. I wear it as a wedding band, but purchased one for each of my two single daughters. It's elegant, yet simple enough for every day use. I love it. <end>  Pretty and delicate  Well the only issue is they do run small. I'm normally a 5 and the 5 I ordered was too small so I gave to my 9 yr old step daughter and it fit her perfectly so I would definantly say go up a size. Other than that it was great. <end>  Beautiful, delicate ring!  I purchased this ring for my daughter for Christmas. It is beautiful. The design is intricate and very delicate. She loves the ring. <end>  Silver Celtic Heart Ring  Absolutely wonderful--bought it as a pinkie ring, and it fits perfectly. The design is raised enough to be eye-catching, but not so high that it catches on things when you are working around the home or yard. Just love this ring! <end>  Very Nice!  The ring, at first, seemed a little smaller than I would have liked. After a few hours, I soon began to like it! I have had it for more than a year, and it hasn't turned my finger green yet! A little pricey for the size, but overall great buy! <end>  WONDERFUL!!  This is a super ring! I love the design. Not weak or anything like that. Very good for a purity ring. Its not that big. I really, really like it. SO...yes go for it! This is a GREAT buy!! I LOVE mine!! <end>  I LOVE THIS RING!A+A+  I FEEL IN LOVE WITH THIS RING WHEN I SAW IT. WHEN IT ARRIVED IN THE MAIL, I PUT IT ON AND HAVENT TAKEN IT OFF. AND THAT WAS WHILE AGO. <end>  great!  This ring is great! i Have had it since last April, and no problems so far. Its cute, and light weight so i can barely feel it, for those of us who are bothered by rings. SO far no warping and still looks new even being worn every day. <end>  LOVE IT!  Love this ring! i wear it all the time! and the beauty about this ring is it doesn't rust nor fade in time... 1 year later and its just like you bought it the first time. <end>  I LOVE IT!!  I was so excited about this ring and when I got it in the mail 3 days later it was just as beautiful as I thought it would be. The size ran a little big but I am wearing it on a different finger than I was going to. I could have sent it back and got another size but I didn't want to go a day without it. Very pretty and I plan to wear it for a long time! <end>  Beautiful ring!  I love this ring! It is so beautiful; the design is gorgeous and it is great quality. I got it for my sister, but I am very tempted to buy one for myself! <end>  Perfect Pinkie Ring  I'd been searching for a cute sterling silver ring that is available in size 3 for my pinkie. I wear this one every day, and it's comfortable, unique, and cute. There are no sharp edges like there are on some "cheap" rings. Definitely recommend. <end>  Beautiful!  I received this ring today, 2 days ahead of the scheduled delivery date, and I instantly fell in love with it. The photos don't do it justice, it is just beautiful. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who loves celtic-inspired jewelry or as a gift for someone that does. It's beautiful!**Edit**My mother likes this ring so much and always comments on it, so I purchased one for her upcoming birthday. She is going to love it! <end>  Trinity Knot Heart Ring  I purchased this product for a friend she loves and cherishes it.Thank you so much! <end>  Awesome  I just got my order and I LOVE this ring..my hands are big and it looks great. <end>  Pretty ring  This is a very pretty ring. It looks much better in person than on the screen. <end>  Wonderful Detail  I got this as a Mothers Day present for my daughter from her six year old daughter "Trinity". She loved the ring. It is heavier and more detailed then I thought it would be and I was extreamly pleased. Thanks Seller! <end>  Perfect little ring  I bought this ring for myself because of my love of celtic and hearts. I bought it to wear on my pinky finger and it is perfect. Like other reviews, it is dainty but sturdy. Quality, well made and very nice. Price was perfect too. This actually looks and feels much better than what it cost. <end>  Very pretty!  I bought this as part of a birthday present for a friend months ago and she wears it practically every day! It's simple and elegant, goes with anything fancy or casual and has nice quality. <end>  Exactly as shown  This product came in less time than expected and in the correct size. I love wearing it! <end>  Pleased!  Thank you for such great items at an affordable value! My daughter and I were very pleased with our rings. Thanks again! Great service. <end>  great ring  This is such a pretty ring. It's very feminine and lightweight. Goes with everything. Perfect for a gift or for yourself. <end>  Gorgeous  Ring was just as expected. Gorgeous and highly recommend other rinbgs from this seller as well. <end>  Good quality.  Good ring, lasts pretty long.I bought this ring back in Febuary, and it is November now. I wear it all the time, only taking it off to shower or if I'm doing something in science. the only downside I've found with it is that there are small holes in the design (they're suppose to be there) that are hard to clean. <end>  Perfect  very cute and very sturdy. I'm very rough with this ring and it has never faded in color or bent in shape. <end>  LOVE IT  This ring has become one of my favorites. I wear it almost everyday. The quality is awesome. The size was perfect. I would recommend this ring. <end>  I absolutely love my ring!  I bought this product to be my purity ring and I love it. It's sturdy, stylish and isn't so big that it looks weird on my finger. It's been on my finger since I got it in the mail. I highly recommend this product. <end>  Ring  I love it. It's very pretty and not expensive. It was shipped to me quickly. I recommend this ring to everyone. <end>  pretty little ring  This ring is even prettier than it's picture. I got a large size for my index finger, and it still looks delicate on my hand. <end>  Very happy  The ring arrived, it took a little longer than I was expecting. The ring however fights fabulous and I love the way it looks on my finger. <end>  wonderful  Got my ring the day after the fourth of July. The ring is much nicer in person than in picture. <end>  Made an Adorable Gift  My best friend is completely obsessed with her heritage, and for her birthday I thought something that flaunted her Irish background would be amazing. This ring was perfect, and the seller did a great job of fixing my silly mistake. The ring is adorable, fits perfectly, and was very well worth everything. <end>  celtic ring  I love the ring it is dainty and got to my home very fast. Worth the money in deed. If I can find more like this at the same price I would love to h ave them all. But my husband says you only have 10 fingers. I keep trying to tell him it's a women thing. <end>  Beautiful!  My wife and I ordered this for our youngest daughter and put it in her stocking. She discovered it Christmas morning. She had previewed it online but had no idea she was getting it. She loves it and wears it all the time. Needless to say, she is thrilled! <end>  heart ring  i love the ring i just purchased. the only thing that made me crazy was the ring size. i used the ring sizer but it was a size to big so i had to send it back and it still seems a little to big. so make sure you order the right size. but other than that i absolutely love the ring and design. <end>  love it!  I got this ring from my boyfriend two years ago and it's great!no problems at all =]i was pretty scared when i was washing out a perm one day and the ring changed to a copper color....but within a few hours it complete changed to silver again. Also it's a great price! <end>  I love this ring!  The picture doesn't show its true beauty. It is very shiny and intricate. Very well made and sturdy. <end>  Great Ring!  I received this ring in about 2 days and I think it's great! It fits perfectly and I love the intricate detail of the heart and knot. I will buy from this seller again! <end>  Trinity Knot Ring  It was in very good condition. The shipping was very fast and i got it within a couples of days of ordering the ring. I have no complaints what so ever. <end>  Very charming ring!  This Celtic ring is adorable! I was proud to give it as a birthday gift. It's low profile feels very comfortable on the hand. It looks very feminine and dainty but not the least bit cheap. I would buy from this seller again. Fast shipping and packaged nicely too. Great price! <end>  Outstanding buy!  I purchased this ring for myself a little over a year ago. I've worn it every day and I now feel lost without it. The price of this ring compared to its quality makes it a great buy! The ring is thick enough so it hasn't lost its shape, yet delicate enough so it doesn't feel bulky. It has lost a little bit of its shine, but nothing noticable (it didn't turn my finger green or anything like that). I simply love this pretty little ring! <end>  Not so small  This ring is very pretty. Its very comfortable and light (dont even feel it). Great for everyday wear. I'm just a little disappointed about the size. Everyone's review made it seem small and danity, but it isnt so. I ordered several rings to give as gifts (we all have small hands). The ring actually looks a bit big on our fingers, but we love the design and how sturdy the ring is. We will definitely buy from them again. <end>  I LOVE THIS RING!!!!!  I have the size 11 ring and it is BEAUTIFUL on my fingers. I love it so much that I've been wearing it in place of my wedding ring. It is very nice quality and extremely durable. It is so comfortable that I forget I have it on. So few rings look good on big fingers...either they are too dainty or huge and gaudy, but this one is just right. I paid $12.99 for mine when it was on sale and next time it is that price, I'm going to buy another one to put up in case I ever lose my first one. <end>  Very nice celtic-style ring  This ring arrived earlier than expected...by two days. It was the correct size, came in a velveteen pouch, and was not damaged in any way. I am very happy with it. It is exactly what I ordered and wanted! <end>  My Mother's Day gift  There was a package in my snail mailbox and I opened it. Turns out it's my Mother's Day gift and I opened it 2 days early! (Well!! It DID have MY name on it!!) Anyway, this is really the sweetest ring. Our 4 yr old daughter picked it out because she said the Trinity symbols are my husband and I and she is the heart in the middle. I have explained to her 4 yr old mind what the Celtic Trinity Knot is, but for now we are calling it "The Gracie ring". It's well made and it isn't flimsy like alot of sterling silver jewelry can be. I am very happy with my ring and I have already selected several other items from this seller. <end>  Are you still thinking about it? BUY IT!  )  If all the 5 star reviews have not convinced you, you're better off with a twig around your finger. Great price, simple yet exquisite design. An everyday ring for all ages. Just crossing my fingers mine doesn't tarnish.. <end>  Beautiful!  This ring is so beautiful. I was looking for a purity ring so I went on Amazon and saw this ring! I'm not a big fan of the True Love Waits rings because there everywhere so I wanted something that was elegant,small,personal, and different and then I found this. The picture of the ring appears big but it's not. Very petite and doesn't get caught on anything. I would recommend this to anyone. <end>  As beautiful as the picture  I was shopping on Amazon for this exact Item. A Celtic ring that was silver, in expensive, and beautiful. Silver Insanity had just what I was looking for, and at a great price too! 11.99!  ) I was thrilled. The Ring arrived in a small box with a black velvet back around it; very elegant. I will deffinately order from Silver Insanity again. Thankyou! <end>  i love it!  I bought this about a month ago and I wear it all the time! It looks even prettier in person. Every once in a while I buy something that I end up wearing all the time and this is one of those things! I would recommend it to anyone. <end>  Excellent piece!  I really love this ring. I ordered it a few months ago, received it promptly from Silver Insanity (7-10 days) and I wear it constantly now. It's sturdy, holds up to the fact that I work with my hands, and I get compliments on it constantly. Also, as someone with larger fingers, I love the fact that Silver Insanity offers excellent rings in larger sizes that are still feminine and delicate! That's a huge plus for me! I would definitely recommend ordering this ring -- it's a must-have piece of jewelry and will become a staple in any accessories box. <end>  SS Celtic Knot Heart Ring  I bought thhis ring for my daughter, and I liked it so much that I purchased another one for myself! It is lovely! <end>  Celtic Trinity Ring  This ring is not only beautiful but it helps me remember my faith. I am so glad I purchased this ring. <end>  Very pretty.. until it starts turning your finger black  It is a really pretty ring, aye? It is pretty in person, but only good for short term wear. I wore it overnight and by the time I woke up I had a black ring around my finger. If you have the time and patience, I hear you can coat metal in clear nail polish and then it wont change. But I'm kind of mad I paid $17 for a ring that turns my skin.The one plus to this? The size 11 was a real size 11. <end>  Really Beautiful  This ring is very pretty. It looks good on my finger and seems to be pretty sturdy. I would recomend this ring to anyone that likes silver celtic inspired rings. <end>  Just what I was looking for  I picked this as my promise ring from my boyfriend. I'm very happy with my purchase from Silver Insanity... I e-mailed with a question and I received a very pleasant and helpful response.Like some other reviewers mentioned, this ring is not as bulky as it appears in the picture. It is actually very dainty but also seems very sturdy. I have a size 5 ring finger so I was worried it would be too overwhelming but it isn't at all.Fast shipping too! <end>  It's just beautiful!  This ring is now one of my favorites and I wear it constantly. It perfectly incorporates my love of Celtic knots and hearts. The quality is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Sterling Silver Jewelry. <end>  Pretty, but very soft and malleable  This really is a pretty ring. I wore it almost nonstop for a few months at least. But perhpas because I rarely took it off, the ring is no longer circular or even oblong. You can't tell when it's on because the Celtic design covers the top of my finger. But when you take it off and set it down, it's clear that the ring has gotten squeezed at various points out of its circular shape. Granted, I rarely took it off for those several months I was wearing it. Then again, I wasn't lifting weights while the thing was on either. So take this particular negative aspect as you will. Ultimately, for the price and the rare larger sizes, I don't regret my purchase at all. <end>  Great for larger hands too  )  I was surprised because of some of the reviews on here mention how the ring is not overwhelming on small hands, I thought with my large hands it would be underwhelming. I ordered a size 13 and it fits perfectly and actually it looks good on my hands. Thanks to my dad, no matter how small I have gotten, my hands have always been big (grrrrrr) and this ring still looks good. It's not too big, but it's not too dainty either. The quality is good and it arrived very quickly.I would buy from this company again - most definitely! <end>  a great experience  The ring is gorgeous. It looks just like the picture, and is very sturdy. It doesn't have the "cheap" feel about it. Also, I thoroughly appreciated the quick shipping and the tracking info, because I'm a fairly impatient person, and I was excited to get it. I've had several people ask me where I got it. Thank you so much! <end>  just right  I really like this ring and pretty much wear it all the time because it's just right everyday dress up or casual. The quality is good. <end>  Great company  Received product quickly, realized I order the wrong size (my fault). Sent an email, received response within 24 hours. They accepted my exchange for the correct size quickly and were very kind. Plus, the ring was beautiful and of good quality.I would buy from them again! <end>  Very Pretty  This is a very pretty ring. It is well made and has very good quality. I kind of thought it was going to be smaller but I was very happy to find that it is bold enough to stand out while maintaining a dainty feminine look. Fantastic array of sizes..wish all manufacturers offered such a choice. <end>  Sister Gifts 2  I bought 4 of this ring, one for each of my three sisters and one for myself. I like the delicate, filigree Celtic knot heart design. We all have small hands and fingers. This ring design doesn't overwhelm our hands. <end>  Great ring  This is a very nice ring for the price. I ordered 2 different rings for my left ring finger. They both fit nicely, but to wear them both I am wearing this one on my right pinkie. It's a very delicate looking ring and I love it! Looks better in real life than it does in the pictures! The shipping was so much quicker than they had indicated! Thanks Amazon and Silver Insanity! <end>  this is the ring i have been looking for!  i love this ring so much when i saw it on the screen i fell in love with it! it is the most beautiful ring i have ever seen! this is definetly the ring i have been looking for! <end>  Beautiful ring  Beautiful ring,but way too big for my fingers. I probably need to oorder a child's size to get the right fit. <end>  I love it!!!!!!  I love this ring!!! I got it about a month ago and I haven't taken it off!!!! I have gotten so many compliments on it!!! I wear it with everyday outfits and with my formal outfits too. It would make a perfect gift for a girl who likes simple rings. <end>  Perfect Ring  I wanted a ring I could wear throughout my second pregnancy...This is PERFECT!!! The longer I wear it, the more I love it. Being of Scottish heritage and my husband Irish, this is a perfect symbol for a loving marriage. Its delicate and light while still being beautiful. Its maintained its shape and hasn't lost its color. No green bleeding or anything negative about it.EDIT  After a year of wearing this ring I have NOTHING bad to say about it! I still love it! I get compliments on it all the time. I adore it. Its still bright and shiny like the day I got it. It has maintained its shape. No complaints of any kind. LOVE IT! <end>  Pleasantly Surprised!  I was a bit worried that the ring would look too small on my hand (I wear a size 13) but it was perfect! I am very pleased with the quality and overall very satisfied. I will definitely order from the seller again. <end>  Love it  I ordered this ring on a Monday and the same week it came in on Thursday...excellent fast shipping! The ring is very dainty which i like a lot!! It's very cute and something I can wear everyday which is what i wanted it for because i love rings  ) If you are girly and like jewelery that isnt flashy than this ring is perfect for you <end>  Pretty, but the picture looks prettiER  When I first spotted this ring, I really liked the design of this and it sorta has this similar type of style that my bf had given me as a promise ring. This ring is cute, but it really wasn't what I expected... this picture made the ring look 3D but in reality, the actual ring itself is somewhat...flat...not flat as in the ring is flat and you can't really wear it, but flas as in..the ring's design and its thickness is different. In the picture, the ring's knot design looked thicker and more fuller. The actual ring has a 2D look, where the design has no thickness. It's thin and flat like a 2D drawing compare to a 3D drawing. It was quite a little bit disappointing.. I was thinking of wearing this for its looks sometimes, but looking at my promise ring makes this ring look real cheap. <end>  Cute  Very shiny unlike other sterling silver I own. If the other reviews weren't so good I would worry that it isn't sterling. Love the ring hate the shipping but I needed a size 3 and couldn't find one anywhere else. If the ring holds up I will order another style of size 3 from the seller. The ring is big enough for any finger in my opinion and larger than I would normally wear on my pinkie but I already got over that! -- Lots of compliments on the ring. I do love it but on my pinkie that is where the eye goes and the ring outshines anything else on that hand. The ring is holding up very well. <end>  This ring is adorable!  I love this ring. It's exactly what I was expecting. It's not too small, not too big. I personally think it looks better in person, than it does in the photo!  ) <end>  It's a really nice ring.  I must say this is a really cute ring, the only thing wrong with it is that it's sort of thin. But, besides that it's really nice. <end>  great ring  I am very happy about this purchase, I was a little concerned about buying it at such a reasonable price(usually you get what you pay for), but I was very surprised when I received it. The ring is made of thick silver(doesnt seem cheap, like most thin rings). The size was perfect, I ordered a Ten and it fit perfect. <end>  Lovely, delicate ring  I purchased this ring for my teen aged niece. She loved it. It isn't a terribly large ring, it is delicate and very attractive on the finger. She wears a size 11 and it did not look too small on her hand. The metal work is good, no rough edges or unfinished looking areas. This is a very good ring for someone who wants something feminine and delicate, not large or thick.This is the second ring I have purchased from Silver Insanity(the other is a sapphire trinity knot ring which my niece absolutely adores. It is gorgeous). They are so quick shipping out my purchase! I will definitely buy from Silver Insanity again. Both rings were well made and looked more expensive than they were. I liked that the ring comes in a little velvety bag and comes with a paper to use if there is any need to exchange the ring. Great service, great product. Thanks! <end>  (  Its a great ring. It is good quality and looks exactly as it does in the picture. I have no complaints or problems with the ring. <end>  beautiful ring  I gave this ring to my daughter for Christmas and she Loves it!! It is beautiful. The craftmanship is excellent. <end>  A very pretty ring  I was very happy when I received this very pretty ring. I plan to wear it all the time. It is good quality yet dainty and feminine. <end>  Beautiful  This ring is very beautiful. I was so excited when I got mine in the mail. I wear it on my pointer finger and love it. I'm always wearing it. Its pretty and simple. <end>  Just love it!  Love how it feels and looks on my pinky finger. Received the ring rather quickly considering the holidays. Would highly recommend this merchant to my closest friends. <end>  celtic ring  I love the ring. It looked even better than I expected!! Thank you. <end>  Love, love, love it!!!!  This ring looks elegant on my hand. I love the design of celtic knots within a heart! Couldn't be happier with the purchase! <end>  Beautiful  This picture does not do it justice.. its much more dainty than the pic. i have not had a problem with it losing shape like some of the reviews said. The only thing is it runs a little larger than what im used to.. I wear a size 6 and i feel its a bit loose for a 6. <end>  Love it!  I just got this product in the mail today! It is exactly as pictured and feels very light on my finger! <end>  Amazing!  I chose this ring as a promise ring from my boyfriend. I absolutely love it. I have worn it everyday for about 6 months now and have not had a single problem.When I initially received the ring it was too large and I needed to exchange it for a smaller size. There was no problem doing so and the company was very nice about the entire process.I highly recommend this company and this ring! <end>  I never take it off.  My boyfriend had bought me this ring along with the Celtic Heart Pendant Necklace Amazon sells for my anniversary gift. The picture does show that it looks rather bulky, but once it's on your finger it's the perfect fit. The details in the picture is exactly what you get and it's a gorgeous ring. I haven't taken it off since the day I got it in the mail. The ring is very sturdy and the entire ring is sterling silver. I simply adore this ring and I do insist if you want to buy it, it's well worth the money! <end>  great little ring!  Very true to ring size. Dainty and yet does not overpower. Absolutely adore and wear everyday! Does not turn fingers green. <end>  Nice Ring!  Delivery was on time and I love the rings I received. Would suggest to others and will buy from again!!! <end>  great ring  Very pleased with the Celtic Trinity ring. Will order again. Arrived quickly <end>  A Fantastic Gift  This ring was a Christmas gift for my twelve-year old daughter. The well made ring is elegant on her size five ring finger. As another reviewer commented, the ring is sturdier than it appears in the picture but it looks graceful on the finger. The delivery of the ring was prompt and without incident. My only complaint, if you can even call it that, was that it came in a dark blue pouch and not in a box. <end>  exactly what i expected  i love my ring it does not bend and has not tarnished, i wear it everyday and get compliments on it all the time.  ) you will love it <end>  awesome  I ordered this a birthday gift for my friend, and one for myself (a friendship ring sorta thing going on)and she loved it. i think i ordered it a wee bit big, because it's slightly large on both of us. but otherwise it's awesome. i'm wearing mine now. <end>  amazing  The quality of This ring is amazing! I bought it for my mom & she doesn't take it off! I highly recommend This product!! <end>  Awesome!  The ring was super shiny when I got it and wrapped up all nice hehe. Looks as flawless as the picture! Came quicker than it anticipated and the size was just right. Absolutely beautiful. Get compliments all the time  ) <end>  Love it so much!  I got this as a gift along with other things on Valentines day. It is so light and comfy. The design is delicate and pretty. We were trying to save money on presents this year. I think I have the better end of the deal since this is soooo nice for the price!  ) <end>  Great ring for the price  You just cannot beat this for the price. I have worn mine every day in place of my wedding band for the past year, and the ring looks just as good as when I first got it. It is fairly pliable; so, I would not order up in sizes too much. I have gotten more compliments on this ring than I have on any other piece of jewelry I have ever owned, including those pieces worth 10-20 times the price. I wasn't expecting that, but it is a nice perk! <end>  Size.  I would LOVE to buy this ring, But how would I go about finding the right size? I dont want to buy it and then not be able to wear it. <end>  beautiful  I like it very much! it is just like the picture, also good quality. the celtic knot seems so realistic it's not flat as I expected it has beautiful round shapes. <end>  Sweet and delicate little ring....  I bought this as a pre-Valentine's Day present for myself and am glad I did. I have long and slender fingers but although the ring is small it filled the front of my finger very nicely--because my fingers are long some delicate rings just seem to get "lost" and don't look like much no matter how nice they are, but this one is very much "there" in an understated way. The ring is flat and smooth and does not catch on to clothing, hose, etc., as a similarly designed ring might. I would love a ring like this in gold but in the meantime this is a nice and girly fun thing to wear from time to time and a new addition to my silver collection that I am quite fond of. I think this would be a special yet inexpensive gift for a girlfriend, sister, daughter, etc. which is almost guaranteed to bring a smile to the receiver. <end>  Insanely Beautiful  Last year, my boyfriend bought me a $200 promise ring that was gold and had some small diamonds set in two interlocking hearts. It broke, so he got me this one instead at my request. You know what... I would choose this ring HANDS DOWN over the $200 ring. In fact, I like this ring more than my (previous) engagement ring & wedding wrap. This is a very reasonably priced ring. It is absolutely perfect. It shines and sparkles brightly. Its intricate design is just so lovely. I ordered a spare! Yep... I am so worried that something will happen to this one and I will not be able to find a replacement... that I ordered a spare. Do not hesitate to buy this, guys. There are some REALLY expensive rings that are just ugly, ugly, ugly! A down-to-earth girl would cherish a quality ring like this. <end>  Lovely  Have bought this ring twice, the first time it was too small. It is very pretty. The heart and knots are not chunky looking, but instead are very feminine. I use it as a toe ring. It has bent out of the round, but this was a plus for me because now the decoration stays on the top of my toe instead of sliding to the underside. I never take it off. <end>  Satisfied Jewelry Customer  This is the second ring I have ordered from this company & tho ,only two, I am not disappointed at all. They met my expectations, they were as the company described the item to be. Thank you K. W. <end>  Pretty and Affordable  I got this as a Christmas Present for my mother. The ring was just as pictured and the fit was spot on. <end>  Disappointed  It's a pretty ring and very dainty, the price was right but the only problem which is a big problem to me is that it turns your finger green. If it wasn't for turning your finger green it would easily be 5 stars but unfortunately I could only give it 2 <end>  Very cute ring.. fast delivery too  I bought this for my 13 years old in size 9. It looks decent and cute. I love how the hearts overlap. the band is decent thickness and this is simply a cute ring. I would recommend it. <end>  Nice ring but  This is a very pretty ring but am very disappointed.....gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas and it was turning her finger green by the end of the day. Very surprising since all other silver items I've purchased have been great. <end>  Beautiful  I love this ring. The size is just right and it is very beautiful. I got a lot of compliments on it. <end>  Ring  What a great gift for myself and my two girls. As a single mother of two daughters, this ring has special meaning to us. It is very, very dainty, but that's what I like about it most of all. You can not beat the price and I think the quality is comparable to what you are spending on it. I would order this item again. <end>  Absolutely a beautiful ring.  This ring is not only gorgeous, but it's delicate. Not as big as it seems in the picture. Exquisite for the price, and was shipped promptly. It arrived in a black velvet bag. It's beautiful. Would buy from this seller again. <end>  Ring  Still wearing the pinky ring with the trinity knotFinally have a pinky ring that does not turn my finger green <end>  Celtic ring  I love this ring. It has kept the color. It is also very nice. My husband is Scottish and it helps you appreciate the heritage. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Ring  I ordered matching rings for my best friend and I, and these were perfect. They were given in a cute little bag with a note in it, which was very thoughtful. Thanks! <end>  Just what I expected, n Happy!  Was exactly what is pictured, fits perfectly, and is get nice quality! I would recommend to others! Definately a good buy. <end>  Eye-catching, gorgeous ring  I absolutely love this ring! This ring fits perfectly and is simply gorgeous. Everybody complemented the ring and asked me where I got it. I would definitely buy it again for a present. <end>  Perfect  This ring is perfect. I have large hands, but very thin fingers and this ring isn't too small to look odd on my large hands and it isn't too large to overpower my thin fingers. It's beautiful, just like the picture. It came quickly, and was in a small black pouch. Very good price for what I got. I wear it every day and have even gone swimming and showered with it on and it has not turned my finger green (somethig I was worried about) Alltogether this is a great buy!! <end>  Returned it.  I'm a little surprised that all reviews are 4 or 5 stars right now. I was quite disappointed with this ring. It is pretty, but it is so lightweight it feels almost flimsy. I had intended to give it as a gift, but no way. It has the feel of a ring that came in one of those plastic bubbles from a 50 cent toy machine in the supermarket - so back it went. Too bad - the design is nice and it is shiny silver. And I wear a lot of silver jewelry, so I generally have reasonable expectations in this price range. This one didn't live up to them, unfortunately. <end>  Gorgeous ring  My boyfriend got this for me as a promise ring/early Valentines Day gift. I couldn't be happier with it. It looks much better in person than it does in the stock photo. It was bigger than I expected but looks just right on my size 7 finger. Overall great quality. <end>  Love. This. Ring.  I love this ring! It's sturdy but dainty and great quality for the price. Service is also impeccable! I ordered the wrong size, but I just had to send it back and get it exchanged. I would - no, I will - definitely order from Silver Insanity again! <end>  cute...but not worth the price  Just recieved this ring today. It looks just like the picture and is very cute, but is not worth the money that i spent on it. On the up side, shipping was fast with no prob. cute ring, but I could have bought it at somewhere like claire's for much less... <end>  Beautiful  I have had this ring for almost a year now, and I must say that it is absolutely fabulous. It is the perfect size, not too large or too small. It has yet to show wear, even though I wear it daily. The design is delicate and meaningful, and I would definitely recommend this ring to anybody who asked! <end>  Celtic Ring  This ring was on my wishlist and so a friend got it for me for Christmas. It was just perfect. The size was dead on, and it came in a velvet sachel that I considered a very unique feature. I would recommend this ring and company to anyone. I have gotten tons of compliments on the ring as well. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful!  I bought this ring for my 18 year old daughter. When I told her I was writing a review for it she said,''I love it!''. That and the fact she's not taken it off since she opened it at Christmas says it all. The picture does not do it justice. It is so delicate and beautiful!Sterling Silver Celtic Trinity Knot Heart Ring (Size 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) <end>  Beautiful Christmas Gift!  What a wonderful surprised look on my daughters' face when she opened the wrapped gift! The thumb ring my daughter had was turning her finger rather unsightly colors like green and black so having showed me the disgusting things the other ring was doing to her finger, I decided to get it from Amazon.com.(This other ring that my daughter had, was not purchased through Amazon.com.) I purchased this new ring from Silver Insanity and she is very happy with her ring and wears it proudly everyday! The item purchased was the sterling silver celtic trinity heart ring size 10. ( It fits her thumb nicely, and doesn't look too gawdy)and is cute and petite. <end>  LOVE THIS RING  This ring is beautiful. I got this ring for Christmas and I could not be more pleased! The ring is delicate but sturdy and will go with whatever I am wearing. <end>  Satisfied Customer  This product arrived and I have been wearing this ring ever since. It's design is pleasing and looks exactly like the photo. <end>  Beautiful!  I love this ring! My boyfriend got it for me as a promise ring and I love it, it's delicate but looks great! <end>  Beautiful!!!  I was very pleasently surprised by the quality of this ring. I am in the process of weightloss so I will be buying this ring again in a smaller size. It is that beautiful! <end>  'PERFECT',  I am so pleased with this ring. When I saw the ring , it was like wow I love it... i loved the dsign and just the simple look but perfect. I was worried becaused I loved it so much but when it came in the mail .. It was like OMY goodness..... I will trust Silver Insanity ...Sterling Silver Celtic Trinity Knot Heart Ring (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) <end>  Absolutely love it!  Items can be hard to judge when viewing pictures online, but I am absolutely thrilled with this ring. I received it yesterday (VERY quick shipping BTW), and I already envision wearing it everyday. The design is so beautiful, that I'm considering using some form of it for a lower back tattoo. <end>  Exactly what I was looking for...  This ring is as pretty as the picture shows. It is very delicate and beautiful. I wear it everyday, and have received many compliments on it. I was looking for celtic jewelry, and this fits exactly what I was looking for. <end>  Delicate, Sturdy and Beautiful  Don't let the blown up picture fool you. This ring is much more dainty and delicate than it looks, but still is sturdy as it is made with a substantial amount of silver. I think this is a good thing given I have small fingers and I like rings that aren't too overpowering. The design is great! And overall, the ring is really well crafted. <end>  wow very nice  it works very nice & is very durable & could youes it with any outfit <end>  Pretty Ring  My daughter was impressed with this ring. It is danty and looks good on her finger. I forget what we paid for it, but her reaction was priceless. <end>  I love this ring!  I absolutely love this ring! The only problem is with online shopping you can only get a whole size. Lucky for me I can wear a 6, because my finger is a 6 and 1/4 b/c I have a slightly larger knuckle. I wear this every day, except when I'm at work, gorgeous product! <end>  very happy  This ring is more dainty than I expected based on the picture, but it is a good size and I absolutely love it! It's so pretty. It was true to size for me, and I look forward to wearing it everyday! <end>  Perfect!  I absolutely love hearts and celtic knots and when I saw this ring I just had to have it! My mom got it for me for Easter and I haven't taken it off since! I love it, the quality is great and it is just perfect! <end>  Awesome buy  I truly love this item, it arrived quick and the product looks awesoe. Love my ring. <end>  I really like my new ring!!  This is a sweet little ring! It is perfect, does not sit too high, so it does not get caught on things.Very pretty. Shipped quickly, like dealing with Silver Insanity! <end>  Perfect for Me!  I have fairly big/wide fingers, and everyone noticed this immediately the next day. I have other rings and they hardly ever notice them. But they sure marveled at this one! I loved how it made my fingers look slimmer, and longer too. The shipping was fast and quick, so don't expect to wait long to have your friends and neighbors marvel over you and your new ring. <end>  The girlfriend loves it.  I bought this ring as a random present for my gf. She saw it online and liked it, but loves it in person. She is very happy with it. A small dainty ring it suits her well. <end>  Lovely Ring Reasonably Priced  I bought this ring online, something I never do, but it came out perfect. Nice fit, and it is beautiful! If you love celtic jewelry, it is lightweight and feminine, simple yet eye-catching. Any excellent value for the price. <end>  Very beautiful  It is a beautiful ring, at first I thought it might be a little too big, but it's not. Very feminine looking and it looks beautiful on. The sizing is also just right.Great seller! Will buy from them again. I had an issue with a different ring the sold and they helped me find something I liked better (this ring). <end>  LOVE THIS RING  I absolutely LOVE this ring! I have a hard time finding bigger sizes of rings, this one fits perfectly! It came exactly as pictured. Shipping was very fast. I wear it everyday, thank you so much! <end>  better than picture  I am very happy with this ring. It's even prettier than it looks in the picture! I would purchase from this vendor again. <end>  I love it!!!  I bought this ring because I loved the design! Looking at the picture it looked like it would have more bulk to it than it actually does. I have big fingers and finding a ring that is beautiful and feminine is difficult for me. This ring gives me that. I have recently become engaged and we plan on using this ring until he finds something that he believes will top it. <end>  Celtic Trinity Ring  I've had this ring for over a year, and it still looks great. Still shines, and it hasn't changed color. The ring size was exact. <end>  Beautiful and strong ring.  I bought this ring 3 years ago mind you im almost 17 now. I fell in love with it and saved up to get it. i have always worn it ever since, no issues at all. i never took it off it went in showers, in the pool, horseback riding, i mean everywhere. about 10 months ago my boyfriend stole it and now he wears it all the time. im a size 8 on my ring finger which is where he and I both wear it. my brother accidently shut my boyfriends hand in the car door.... bent the ring to his finger. i asked my dad if he could get it off his hand and he bent it back. and it still looks brand new. I would suggest this ring for anything. I love this ring. <end>  love this ring  I am completely thrilled with this ring. The quality is great, sturdy but not bulky. I would recommend this to anyone. Great alternative to the claddagh rings. show your heritage! <end>  Tina's b'day ring  Ring was bought for grandchild's birthday.Nice quality and weight; good design touches...and she ishappy. Best deal yet! <end>  Amazing quality!  I've had this ring for over 2 years, and I wear it everyday. It looks the same as when I got it, and I've never had to use jewelry cleaner! It's still so shiny and gorgeous. I started off wearing it on my middle finger, and it's now on my ring finger, because I got it when I was 15! Haha. I adore this ring, and I have other jewelry from Silver Insanity as well, and everything I've gotten from them is amazing quality. I get compliments on this ring all the time, and I absolutely adore it. <end>  Even prettier in person!!!!  This ring is more than I expected; it is so shiny and beautiful. I love the details of the Celtic knots and how feminine it looks. It is just the right size for my small finger (size 5) and I just can't stop looking at it. It is so comfortable to wear that sometimes I even forget I have it on. I do wish they had the ring in half sizes though, but other wise you won't be disappointed with this ring!!! <end>  My girlfriend loved it  bought this as a birthday present for my girlfriend and she adored it. i have absolutely no complaints about it. <end>  Very good ring  The ring is small but it is real and looks really good. It collects oils and dirt quickly so make sure you have silver polish and cleaner. <end>  Perfect  Ring shipped very quickly. Looks like great quality. I got it for my girlfriend as an anniversary present. She says it fits perfectly and is very comfortable! We are both very pleased. Thank you!!! <end>  dainty yet sturdy  I ordered 3 of these for myself and my daughters, (23 and 14) and they really liked them. The design is really pretty. So far we have had no issues with them. The shipping was really fast. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Trinity Know Heart Ring  This ring was even more beautiful in person than it was in the picture. I love it!! It arrived on time, and is such good quality for the price. This seller has a great selection of beautiful jewelry. I highly recommend checking it out! <end>  SS Celtic Trinity Knot Heart Ring  This is an eye catcher! I have gotten many compliments on this little ring which costs very little. It has a very nice shine and design and really is a great bargain! <end>  **Very Pretty Ring**  I bought this ring for myself and I was really amazed at the quality of this ring for the small amount it's offered for, the detail work is also really nicely done and the ring is very comfortable to wear. I have small hands so it stands out very nice on me. I would highly recommend this ring to anyone who likes the Celtic Trinity Knot Style.  ) <end>  Deeply meaningful  I bought this ring as a symbol of my ongoing transition from organized Christianity to something older, deeper and more meaningful for me. It symbolizes the start of a new life, and it was appropriate that it arrived on the first day of spring. It's delicately beautiful and I'm totally thrilled with my choice. <end>  Great product  I bought this ring as a promise ring for my girlfriend, and she really liked it. The product was very well made, and arrived promptly. A++ <end>  Pretty ring, great value  This is a very pretty, delicate ring, and the quality is very good considering the price. <end>  It's perfect  This ring is beautiful! I ordered several of them. Two for me(so I can wear it on different fingers), one for my daughter, one for my best friend we all love them. It doesn't matter what finger you wear them on this ring looks great on any of them. The detail is wonderful, it doesn't matter how big or small the ring is 4-13 you don't lose any of the detial. It lays nice and flat and doesn't catch on clothes and it is so light you won't even remember you have it on. It fits into every style whether it sophisticated or casual. It is perfect and we all get tons of compliments on them. <end>  Perfect!  This ring was intended to be just a promise ring for me and my boyfriend. He liked it so much, as did I, that we decided to make it my engagement ring. It has a simple kind of elegance to it. Beautiful. <end>  Beautiful ring, good value  This ring arrived in a protective pouch, in perfect condition. It is even better looking in person, if a little more delicate than I had expected. The fit was excellent also. <end>  Dainty ring  I am very satisfied with this piece of jewelry. It has a good proportion to my finger, and the design is clean and pretty. The ring itself feels a little tight, but it might be from me choosing the wrong size. Some folks have complained that the band has warped on this product, but part of being sterling silver includes a level of softness to the metal, but it feels very sturdy. Package also arrived three days earlier than projected date. <end>  Very Pretty  i liked this ring a lot. i was using it as a thumb ring. unfortunately, i was driving home from work one evening and , you're Not gonna believe this, there was a baby standing in the middle of the road ! long story short, i stopped to get the baby out of the road and return him to his 'parents' and as i was walking across the street w/ him, i stepped into their yard and stepped into a hole or low spot and fell and baby went flying out of my arms...baby was fine...thankfully, it had been raining a lot here and the yard was soft and he landed flat on his back ( this would have been really comical had it not been for the fact that the BABY WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DANG ROAD!!!! and i was extremely shook up ( i have a total hip replacement on one side) and when i got home, i realized my new ring was missing. i drove back to the place and lo and behold, there was my darling little ring...in the road...smushed ! it had already been run over by someone as it apparently flew off my finger when i fell and sent baby flying ! what a nightmare !!but the service was great and the ring was pretty and exactly what i had wanted...oh well !! hahahahahaha <end>  LOVE!!  I absolutely love this ring. It shipped extremely fast and fits perfect. This is my most recent purchase and by far there is no complaints, just compliments. Thank you so much! I'm in love. <end>  Pretty but band can bend  I've had this ring for four or five years now and I never take it off. It still looks great - sometimes lotion or soap will get caught in the little holes in the knots but they always wash out after a day or two. The band is bent though but its not noticeable when I wear the ring and you look at it straight on - it just looks funny when you look at it from the palm side of my hand. I would still recommend this ring, the design is too pretty to pass up! <end>  Pleased with my purchase  The ring came quickly and was exactly what I thought it would be....it was a present for my daughter's birthday and she hasn't taken it off since she got it. Thanks! <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Trinity Heart Ring  I love this ring! It's pretty, rust-less, and definitely made well. I guess the only thing I was a bit disappointed about was that when I got it, it turned out to be a thinly made silver ring. The ring itself isn't a heavy silver made ring as most James Avery rings are made. Other than that, it's beautiful. I love it. <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring is so beautiful... I got it to be used as a purity ring for my sister, who was looking for one and has had issues with rings giving her rashes in the past. So far she is rash-free, and loves the ring. (She may have been allergic to nickel, so the sterling is just the ticket!) My other sister fell in love with it and got the same one  ) I think it's a bit more unique and complex a design than your average Celtic knot ring, and yet isn't too overpoweringly knotted. Just perfect  ) Could also be used as an engagement ring, or even a wedding band as well (if you like the Claddagh but want a slightly different alternative to the traditional design). Love it! <end>  Ring Review  Beautiful ring, great quality. Size is a little off (ring is quite thin, so I should have got a smaller band size. Delivery was quick. <end>  blue/green skin  Turned my girlfriends finger blue on first day that she wore it. It is advertised as sterling silver, while she has owned other sterling silver rings that have not had that effect. <end>  GOOD BUY  very pretty feminine...I like it a lot ..metal is a little soft but not a big deal ...the size fits great and the style makes it worth it.. thumbs up <end>  Perfect for what I wanted  I got this ring as an anniversary present. I asked for a pretty, inexpensive ring that I could wear while TDY and deployed because I didn't want to lose my wedding set in a foreign country. I love Celtic designs, and the sizes are pretty much spot on (at least for me). <end>  I am in Love  This ring is fantastic! It looks just like it does in the picture! I would highly recommend this if you wants some type of Celtic Jewelry. <end>  Another great Celtic ring  My wife loves thing ring I bought her. She wears it on her pinky. The ring is high quality and makes a nice addition to an Irish Celtic ring collection. We love the Celtic heart design. <end>  simple beauty  purchased as a gift for my daughter. I was so happy to find a large size range. It is a great value for the price! <end>  Wear it everyday!  Love it, its very cute. Thinner than I thought it was going to be but still good. Size is right also. <end>  worth the money  this ring is beautiful and very well made,,, i am completely satisfied and would recomend this ring to anyone ... <end>  LOVEEE!!!  Its a nice girly way to show off my irish heritage!!! I wear it everyday ) I'd love to get some more celtic knot jewelry items!!!!!!!! <end>  perfect ring  This ring suited me so perfectly. I showed my mom & she was gushing over it like I did. So I bought & gave one to my mother & each of my sisters. I love it, They say they love it too. it is very wearable & does not bend. it is beautiful & a rich history. <end>  Very Cute - But Not As Pretty As Pictured  This ring is very cute and I will probably wear everyday. However, the picture makes it look thicker than it really is. The ring is very light and thin. The design is beautiful. <end>  Adorable on a small hand  I've had this ring for 4 years and I'm still wearing it. I have a small hand and fingers and this ring doesn't look to big. I even wear another ring on the same hand and it still doesn't look like too much. Perfect for a small hand. <end>  A bargain.  The packaging of the ring could have been better. A little ring box would be nice.The heart on the ring is a bit oblong.I've grown to like this ring a lot and wear it on my pinky all the time.The back of the heart area is tarnished a bit.It is stamped with the .925 and it has not given me any weird green markings or such.For that price the ring is really pretty. Would buy again! <end>  Lovely  The shipping is quick and comes in a little pouch. One thing to keep in mind before purchasing is the ring size. I recommend buying a size smaller.This is a simple ok to wear every day ring. I bought this ring twice, the first time i purchased it in a size 9 and turns out the size was a little too big so i re-ordered it in a size 8. I gave the first ring to my boyfriend and he now wears it in his necklace along with this tags and i wear my ring every day. I have cleaned the ring with a jewelry cleaner rag and it shines very nicely. I've had this ring for about 8 months now and it's still as lovely as the first day I received it... <end>  Love, love, love!  I am completely in love with this ring. It is so gorgeous! It's really light and delicate looking, but the quality is excellent and it's definitely sturdy. I keep looking at ring finger because it looks so good on! Definitely recommend it if you like celtic knot jewelry.  ) <end>  Dainty and Very Pretty  I love Celtic Knot jewelry, and this is definitely worth the money. I saw all the other reviews and I was all, "Hey, this looks pretty cool. Hmm, five stars? I'll get it!" I get so many compliments at school, and I am happy with this purchase. The only thing is, it begins to lose its shine if you wear it vigorously. Good thing I waited to post a review, because I took away a star that would have been there if it wasn't so...tarnish-y. It does have a .925 stamp on the inside, and the design is so dainty. Another downside is that the silver that connects the designs is easy to see. But still very pretty, and I would definitely recommend this.Hope it helped! <end>  Cheap material  I bought this as a gift for my sister and it broke. The band is too thin (palm side) and the material was too weak. <end>  ring size  this ring runs one size bigger than the ring size chart. I had to exchange for one size smaller after getting it. Other than the ring size being too big, it's a very pretty ring. <end>  Finger Turned Green with in 24 hours!  Not happy! The reason is becuase my finger turned green in less than 24 hrs after having it on my finger. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I love this ring, great quality not to big/small. Although I missed judged the size, and had lost some weight it is now to big to wear. I have a ring sizer on with the ring and it still spins around my finger. I may get another ring (same one) in a smaller size. <end>  great product, sketchy service  don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful ring. i ordered it in a size 8, but the company sent me a size 6. i figured it wouldn't be a big deal; i'd just contact the company and make an exchange. i've e-mailed them 3 times over the last month and they have been neglecting to reply. their jewelry is beautiful, but their customer service isn't. <end>  PERFECT!  My family heritage is Celtic, and the Claddagh ring is Irish! This is perfect! It shows my Celtic heritage, fits perfectly and is a ring I can wear every day with pride. Wear the point out if not involved in a relationship, wear it pointing in if in a relationship! I love it! <end>  Beautiful silver heart ring  I bought this in a size 7 and it fits perfectly for me. I wear this ring almost every day and it still shows no sign or wear and tear or tarnishing.Excellent detailing, true to size, and durable! <end>  Beautiful!  My fiance bought this ring for me, it is absolutely gorgeous I wear it everyday . I especially like the triquetras on either side of the heart . <end>  Never got it  I know is a GREAT ring...unfortunatelly it was shipped on USPS and we never got it....they show they delivered...on saturday...we do not work on saturday and it is the adress at my work...... <end>
 B000FZ5JYC  Intricate Celtic Serpent Knot Adjustable 18" Sterling Silver Necklace ||	  not very sturdy  I bought this item for a friend, when I received it was absolutely beautiful and she loved it. Unfortunately, the chain broke 3 days later with normal wear. I went to get the chain fixed and it some how got lost. Now I came back to the site to replace it and its 13 dollars more than when i originally bought it! As you can tell, this is not a chain that can be easily replaced with something you already have, keep that in mind. <end>
 B000FZ5JZ6  Genuine Dark Blue Lapis Inlay Irish Celtic Claddagh Heart Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Great as always  I ordered this for my niece and was very pleased with the quality of the product, and more importantly my niece loved them.Thanks much.Patrick <end>  claddagh earrings  The earrings are a lot heavier than they appear in the picture, really excellent quality. Great value for money. <end>  Beautiful Earrings, But. . .  I bought these earrings a year ago, and today, I am ordering another pair. I hope the new pair looks identical to the first pair because I just recently had need to wear the first pair for the first time, and one came out of my ear and was lost in less than an hour! I recommend reshaping the wires so that they can't cantilever themselves out of your ear(s) and/or adding earring backs to the ends of the wires to prevent their slipping out on their own. <end>
 B000FZ947U  Sterling Silver Swirled Celtic Knot Round Green Peridot 17" Necklace ||	  absolutely gorgeous!  the necklace is absolutely gorgeous - the picture does not do justice to the actual product. I'm sure my daughter will just love it. <end>  Excellent piece.  This is my new favorite piece of jewelry. I get comments on it all the time. I like the way the chain never causes it to turn around (with the clasp in the front) that is a problem with other pieces I have. The chain is a high quaity giving you three setting as to where it can be fastened. It is beautiful and durable. A good buy, I'm very happy with it. <end>  beautiful celtic knots!  my husband gave this necklace to me a few xmas' ago... i wear it almost daily and it stands up to my daily wear and tear. it is beautiful and i love it. <end>  nice design and wears well  The front of this necklace is nice and well made. The two metal peaces that connect with the chain and can move (intentionally as designed). The back of the peace looks a bit rough and unfinished.I have had this necklace for a while and over time it wears well. In other words, it lasts and it durable. <end>
 B000FZ94CK  Sterling Silver Celtic Trinity Knot Heart Link Bracelet ||	  moms day bracelet  I have to say i really like this bracelet.It was a little smaller than I expected but actually its just right not to heavy. I get a lot of compliments on it, a very unusual piece. i love it !!! <end>  Bracelet  Perfect condition. Matches the ring I bought. They look great together. Great prices for sterling silver. Well packaged and punctual service. No complaints.  ) <end>
 B000FZRP1C  Multicolor Jade Nugget Bracelet ||	  scottishterrier  The stones are quite nice but the bracelet is too tight. It needs at least one more stone to fit my wrist and I have a small wrist - about 6-3/4". It is too tight to wear comfortably. The colors of the stones are bright - just like in the pictures. Please add one or two more stones. <end>
 B000G0APWC  Sterling Silver Diamond Cubic Zirconia O Bangle Bracelet ||	  Simple & Bold  The 'O' shaped cuff bangle is just beautiful. It's a very simple design with a row of CZs lining on the 'O' top & there you have a fuss-free & bold design, easily eye-catching. There're not many 'O' shaped bangle around in other websites & this definitely looks the best. I'm very happy & fortunate to find it. <end>
 B000G0AQ08  Sparkling Triple Row Pave CZ Bangle Bracelet ||	  Disappointed  This item is nothing like the picture. It looked cheap and felt light weight. One stone was set deeper than the others so it looked off. The stones did not sparkle like they do in the picture. Easy return, but wasted money in shipping both ways. Don't waste your money on this one. I was so disappointed.Update  I found the same bracelet (but so much better!!!) at Nordstrom (same price) and LOVE IT!!!  ) I bought it Aug 2007, and I was there recently, and they carry it. <end>  Triple Row Pave CZ Bangle Bracelet  I needed something nice but not to expensive just to wear when I go out at night. This was perfect! Really classy and perfect for the price. <end>

 B000G2IFRM  Hello Kitty Purple Fairy Cat Animal Theme Licensed Charm Bracelet ||	  quick shipping  i bought this and another charm on a saturday and received them on monday. there was no special shipping. i live in WV and this was shipped from CA. i have ordered from CC before and love the charms. they are great and good quality. <end>
 B000G6JMAW  Pugster Swarovski Crystal Heart Shaped Three Leaf Clover Pendant Necklace - Peridot Green For Women ||	  CMG  this is so beautiful and feminine. I am going to order more for Christmas as gifts. <end>
 B000G6JT7S  Sterling Silver Black Braided Synthetic Leather Bracelet - 7.5" ||	  Very Nice  This leather bracelet was very nice. It was just what they said it would be. <end>  High price, low quality - this is what you'll get now.  First time I have bought this bracelet more tan 2 years ago. It was perfect and I used to love it. Until I've lost it one day.Then I decided to buy 2 more of it. But unfortunately I am not happy with the purchase this time. (Note, that the seller is the same and the only.) The metal (silver?) parts of bracelet are in something yellow substance like glue! Moreover, the one of the 2 bracelets I've bought is totally deserves nothing more than to be thrown out. It has defective leather straps. In one place it is torn, in others it is shines with gloss. Very disappointed. <end>
 B000G6KJFY  Sterling Silver Black Braided Faux Leather Bracelet 7" ||	  Love It !  I put this on two months ago when I received it, and haven't taken it off since. It still looks brand new and I just know it will last a long time. Great buy and no complaints whatsoever. <end>  Real Leather  Not much to say here, not too crazy about it but it is made of leather. <end>  Perfect Bracelet!!!  I love, love, love my new bracelet. It's the perfect size and the clasp is strong enough that there is no worry about losing it! The price is definitely right too!! <end>
 B000G7P18I  Fancy Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Pear Drop Earrings ||	  Stunning pageant earrings  I have worn these beautiful earrings since 2007. They were just right for pageants, and when I won, they complemented my crown perfectly. They are substantially sized but not gaudy.I like that they're sterling, so I can wear them to formal events for years to come. <end>
 B000G7P57U  Strength Sterling Silver Friendship Ring ||	  Cute Ring  The ring is pretty cute but it was a bit thicker than I anticipated. Also, the black peeled off from the words but after all of the black was gone I actually liked the ring more. <end>
 B000G7T7K6  Sparkling Vine of CZ Leaf Earrings ||	  not what I hoped  I purchased these earrings to wear out to dinner a year ago but unfortunately have only worn them once. The first stone was much bigger than I expected, and instead of looking classy they look cheesy and fake. <end>
 B000G7UZV6  Glamorous Peardrop CZ Dangle Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Beautiful Earrings  I bought these earrings to wear in my wedding. They sparkle beautifully and I admire them in all the pics that were taken in the wedding. I highly recommend them! <end>  Pretty from the front  I purchased these earrings to wear on my wedding day, and they are beautiful...from the front. The backs of these reveal how cheap they really are. Unfortunately one of the earrings does not hang completely straight, and keeps tilting to the left, so it shows a bit of the back... which is disappointing. I may try to tighten the hinges to see if I can force it to hang straight...otherwise I will have to return them. <end>
 B000G7V3Q2  The Forget Me Not Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Disappointing  The ring came in good time and the silver is shiny. However, there is no black in the lettering and the phrase on it can not be read. I wear it as a thumb ring and it made my thumb break out. I would return it expect the phrase on it, "forget me not", is important to me. I would love to give this ring an excellent review, but I just can not do that. <end>
 B000G7VV28  Elegant Sapphire & Clear Cubic Zirconia Hoop Earrings ||	  Beautiful and As Pictured/Described  ~BACKGROUND~I purchased this piece as a gift for my wife.~PROS~- Synthetic cut gems means no blemishes or flaws - who really knows or cares whether the gems are natural or real? Natural costs way too much!- Appears to made well with no flaws or irregularities.- Necklace comes packaged well. It is in a small velvet-like pouch and a box.- Size description is accurate at 0.75 inches.~CONS~- None so far!~CONCLUSION~My wife really likes the earrings and I feel it is a good value for the price.This is the third item I have purchased from Eve's Addiction and have been very satisfied with their shipping, packaging and products. <end>

Just BEAUTIFUL! <end>  Spectacular Shiny Piece  Beautifull piece, shiny as diamond, I will definitly buy more merchandise from this seller. <end>
 B000GAAKQ8  Ruby Bubbles Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Good ring...  I love this ring. It looks beautiful, and is very durable. I did lose a stone, but I was going through training as a restaurant manager. For this price, it's well worth it. From what I remember, it arrived fast as well. I am very happy with my husband's purchase. I know my place. <end>
 B000GAP0P4  Copper bracelets - Style x29514 ||	  Terrible customer service.. Awful  If you read the add you (at least I was) are led to believe that you were getting more than one bracelet. They charged me $9 for shipping a small two ounce yellow padded envelope with only one inside which was double the price of the bracelet(s)! I tried contacting the company several times and could only leave messages of which no one returned my calls. I went back later and resurched the add and they had changed the price. Oblivious to me they had made a mistake advertising their product and were not going to honor their add. Shame on them! <end>
 B000GB8OQ0  Southwestern Style Three Dimensional Lizard Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 9, #10992 ||	  Love it!  Very beautiful. I bought it for my boyfriend and he wears it every day. Wonderful quality. <end>

 B000GBD0UA  4.5 in. Kristin Bracelet featuring Freshwater Pearls and Blue Swarovski Crystals ||	  so pretty  I just bought this bracelet for my 3 month old. It is such a pretty little bracelet and durable. I have not taken it off even though they say to, and I have no worries of it breaking. I highly recommend this bracelet, perfect little girl gift. <end>
 B000GCN7NE  Floral Silver Grey & Light Blue 100% Silk Necktie & Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  There is a reason for a low price  There is no such thing as a free lunch. And there is not such thing as 80% discount for nothing. This tie is indeed handmade. It is handmade to the point that it feels a bit too homemade. The tie is heavy and the texture is fine but it is not sitting smooth. It is being pulled in all directions due to errors in stitching or an initial cut. Perhaps it possible to iron out all the taylor's erros, however, I think it will never be completely smooth. Ironing won't change the cut. Therefore, although the tie is made of silk and made by hands, it is not a winner due to defects in design. It could be just my purchase.The cufflinks are very mediocre. They are small, look like "upholstered" buttons. I did not realize that the cufflinks would be covered in fabric. Fabric cufflinks aged this set by 20 years, in my opinion. <end>
 B000GDGYQA  Leather bracelet, 'Turtle Voyage' ||	  damaged but happy  item arrived damaged but company provided replacement efficiently and without any hassle. polite, prompt and efficient service. attractive bracelet. the silver beads on the bracelet are a little cheap looking but as they age and oxide they will look better.... <end>
 B000GDO0HU  Bracelet, 'Coral Paths' (large) ||	  coal paths review  This bracelet is beautiful. It has the natural markings for coral and is wide without being heavy.I have really enjoyed wearing it and have recieved many compliments. <end>  Disappointed  Yeah, it's pretty. Great in theory, but it actually hurt my arm. It doesn't sit comfortably, and the sharp ends actually dug into my skin, leaving angry welts all over my forearm. Sending it back. Sorry, I really did want to support the artist in Thailand, and Novica is an awesome company. Just didn't work out like I thought it was going to. <end>
 B000GDZD12  Pugster Fleur De Lis Crown Right Hand Ring ||	  Classy!  This ring is very masculine and eye catching!I got it for my prince of a boyfriend and he gets compliments on it all the time!

 B000GGPQ6Q  Sapphire and CZ Engagement Ring ||	  Very pretty ring!  This ring is very pretty! The center stone is a beautiful sapphire blue, I wear it in place of my engagement ring and I have gotten so many compliments. <end>  Cheap and Not Worth the Money  The image of this ring is very deceptive. The setting looks like costume jewelry or like it came from a bubble gum machine. The "blue" cz is actually black in any light. I wouldn't wear this ring anywhere, and I will never purchase from this seller again. <end>
 B000GH0K0W  Garnet and Heart Charm Sterling Silver Necklace ||	  Not pretty  Purchased for myself for a fun piece of jewelry...not pretty. I returned it because I knew it would not be worn. <end>

 B000GHKGHY  Red Jade and Onyx Balanced Heart Pendant, 14k Gold ||	  TOO SMALL TO BE A GIFT  I bought this heart shaped pendant with a chain for a Valentine's Day gift for one of my daughters who attends college out of town. I thought it would be something she could keep as a remembrance, rather than the usual card and stuffed animal. Well when I finally saw it in person, I was appalled at how small and insignificant it was. It also has a somewhat "plastic" quality to it. If you want to buy something as a memorable gift, don't buy this! <end>
 B000GHUOJE  Sapphire Blue Double Gem Bioplast Belly Ring ||	  belly ring  The belly ring I bought is overall a good product. The color of the stones are very pretty, but the clear inner portion doesnt allow you to turn it while its in the hole. I like to do that to keep the hole clear. Other than that I love the new belly ring. <end>
 B000GHZYUS  Ruby Red Double Gem BIOPLAST Belly Ring ||	  wow  it looks like a real gem and i love how it's flexible! very nice though i warn u when u first clean it it kinda disappears lol, when i first get any belly ring i always peroxide it, well i take it apart then just leave it in my hand and pour some on, the little bar will disapper when wet so be carefull when cleaning it or you'll forget its there and probably pour it down the drain, i came very close to doing that. <end>

The sapphire stones are gorgeous. I recommend this ring to anyone who enjoy vintage jewels. It looks like a ring my grandmother would wear. Even her mother. The sellers were very helpful with my questions. <end>  Beautiful & truly vintage!  The ring is beautiful, delicate & truly looks vintage. Sizing is true.The filigree is amazing - in total it stands out amongst modern jewellery as something unique and special from a distant era - when people took the time to concern themselves with the finest of details.I'll be wearing a work of art! <end>  Beautiful ring  This ring was purchasaed for my daughter and looks lovely on her hand. She loves art deco and the fit was perfect. <end>  Even more beautiful in person...  I got this from my husband as an anniversary gift and it is BEAUTIFUL! It is even more beautiful in person than in the photos shown. The stones look darker when you're wearing the ring but I think the picture is accurate for how dark they are when it's on. We don't have any heirlooms in my family and I feel like I got one with this ring. People always think it's a real antique. I love it! <end>  Not as pictured  Stones don't look like sapphire, the setting is dull, even for antiqued. So small that the darkness is detrimental to the whole ring. I was very disappointed. <end>  Not as pictured  Your picture of this rings shows blue sapphires so I was disappointed to see that the ring I received has such dark stones that they appear black. The ring is definitely NOT as advertised. <end>
 B000GJVGCQ  Designer Inspired Cubic Zirconia Roman Numeral Band, 7 ||	  worst looking ring i've seen so far  i don't usually write reviews.but this ring is so bad that i had to write a review, so that other people won't be disappointed with buying this ring.i bought the ring because picture looks very good and it looks like it's very well made with high quality.but when i got the ring, it was so cheap looking that i thought it was a joke.ring looks like one of those 25 cents toy that you pull out of vending machine.cz doesn't have any sparkles at all.and cz is not even all the way around the ring.it covers only half of the ring.all in all, it's the worst looking ring i've seen so far. <end>

 B000GOV2WK  Past Present & Future Wedding CZ Ring Set ||	  Pretty but, too much for me  This ring is very pretty and sparkles a LOT but it was a little "busy" for my taste. It would be perfect for someone who likes lots of stones. <end>  So freakin sparkly!  i used a discount code on this one...i believe it was freefall, from their catalog. i needed a ring i could wear going to the beach and such so i didn't have to worry about my real engagement ring getting ruined. let me tell you, this ring is absolutely gorgeous. it is soooo sparkly and eye catching sometimes i wear it more than my actual engagement set. looove it. <end>  THIS COMPANY BITES!  You want my input? I'm giving you it!My fiancee ordered directly from Evesaddiction.com because they had a free shipping weekend, where amazon would have charged.Unfortunately we made the mistake of ordering directly from them rather than through amazon.com.We had to cancel the order because we had came accross something and we weren't sure about it.. than after double checking we decided to contacted evesaddiction.com.they went ahead and canceled the order but had told us that we would need to re-order the rings since the order number was no good.We went ahead and did so, and after almost a week now.. not only have our rings not arrived yet.. the order that we had canceled turned out was never canceled and they charged our bank account twice and refuse to refund unless we ship back their product!I'm a little nervous about that because i'm not even sure we'll see that 53 bucks that was charged extra to our account even if we do send them back their package.You want my advice? Order directly through amazon... they would have taken care of this problem long before any of this crap happened. <end>
 B000GP0810  Charles Leonard Inc. Loose Leaf Rings, 2.50 Inches Diameter, Silver, 25 per Box (R69) ||	  Finally found them at Amazon!!  I could not find these anywhere locally. What 's with that???

 B000GQO4LY  Platinum Box Chain, 18" ||	  be careful though  I was shopping for a platinum chain so my wife could wear her rings on it at work. She washes her hands a lot, and the soap gets caught underneath the rings and irritates her skin somethin' fierce. Anyway, she LOVES the chain, but it is WAY too small to hold her rings.So be careful buying this type of jewelry on-line. The chain was great (hence 5 stars) but I misjudged the size. <end>  Value of money  With platinum touching $2000/Oz this product is a good buy, value for money. Its is lot smaller than the picture. <end>  gorgeous !  actually i was searching for platinum chain and i liked this chain so very much !! <end>
 B000GTJLWI  Bask Oval Mystic Topaz Ring (size  6) ||	  Picture is Not Justice  I bought this ring as a present for myself. I love mystic fire topaz stones. This ring came, and it was gorgeous in the different hues it picks up blues, pinks, purples from other things around it. It is simple in setting and that's what makes the gem stand out so boldly. Worth the price, Most Def. <end>
 B000GULJAE  Dr. Piercing's Piercing Aftercare Product - 36 swab pack ||	  Convenient and hygenic  I used this for my bellly piercing. Although I still did my sea salt soaks, this was a great way to remove excess lymph and impurities after every soak. I also used them when I was in a hurry and had no time to do a soak. It was easy to bring around with me when I travel, plus the case makes a great coin purse when you're done with the swabs. I would still recommend sea salt soaks though. This is just a product you can use in addition to the soaks. <end>  Yes  Just what I needed for my piercings....When you piercing is irritated and itchy this is the right product to use <end>  External use only + Piercings = ???  How is this meant specifically for piercings if it's for external use only? Much cheaper (and better, imo) to do actual sea salt soaks.I used these once, on my eyebrow piercing. They're nothing special and my piercer was just pitching the product. <end>
 B000GV06KC  3 Stone Cubic Zirconia Wedding Set, 7 ||	  Nice Wedding Ring Set  I thought it was a little too gawdy. The center stone was too big. Will wear it every now and then for a nice occasion, but not for everyday use. Got it really quick too. <end>  Loved the ring!  The ring is beautiful, I bought it to use a "traveler" for my fiancee. Definitely order from these folks as far out as possible, they are sloooooooooow and no one their seems ot know what's going with an order. <end>  Just Right  This ring's center stone is not too big, not too small. It's sized just right to catch eyes without being gawdy in the least. This ring has an antique look about it, and if you like that, and are a lover of silver,this ring is just right. I love the character of the band, with the tiny little stones artistically set around it.I have a real diamond wedding set, but I wear this one, because I honestly like it better! <end>
 B000GV06ZM  Drop Shape Garnet & Marcasite Pendant ||	  Very nice.  I was looking for a pendant to match some tear drop earrings I got from a different merchant and this looked like it would match...it did perfectly and I was extremely pleased with the cut, color, and the quality. <end>
 B000GWOH1A  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 4mm Herringbone Italian Chain Necklace ||	  Made me break out  I've worn silver jewelry for years with no problem, but within days of putting this necklace on, I broke out in a blistery rash all around my neck. It makes me wonder if it is really sterling silver.The necklace is nice looking, but I can't wear it. <end>
 B000GWQKW4  Sterling Silver Multi Cubic Zirconia Channel Set 3mm Eternity Band Ring Size 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  Nice item  I bought two of these rings, one for me and one for my granddaughter. We are both very pleased.Quality jewelry. <end>  very pleased- at first...  I loved this ring when I first opened the box and put it on! It was a bit narrower than I expected, (things like this should be pictured actually ON a finger/hand in the ads, to give a good idea of the width). It had lots of sparkle, and the silver was brilliant.However, after wearing the ring for a week or two, the silver lost all it's shine and luster. The stones don't sparkle anymore either, even after cleaning. I've been wearing (two) sterling silver rings (plain bands) 24/7 for almost 30 years and they are still much shinier than this ring is after only two weeks. I'm quite disappointed. I'm not wearing it anymore... <end>  No package received  I live overseas and somehow the item did not reach to me. It took 1.5 months of waiting for post and exchanging e-mails. Anyway, at the end they refunded my purchase. <end>  not very high quality  I ordered several rings, 2 of which are still in gift boxes, but the multicolored style, I ordered 1 of those, a pink and a blue one...the stones fall right out! The blue square stone channel set has not been given yet as it is a gift...I can only hope it has more staying power. Living on an island it would cost me more to return ship it than it would be worth, but I am not so satisfied with these products. <end>  good.  very pretty, very good price. it does fade a bit though, and now its much darker than when i got it (about 2 months ago). one stone fell out, but thats probably more my fault. definitly a good deal for your money. <end>  Incredible!  I loved this ring. I loved it from the picture but was skeptical about how it would look when it arrived and the quality and durability. I was Very surprised, it was just as beautiful as the picture and has continued to withstand all the things I do. (I actually waited a while to write this review because I wanted to see how the ring would hold up.) I also ordered two other rings from this company...and If you see this again you know why...I cut and paste! <end>  Review for Sterling Silver Ring  Its a beautiful ring. It was slighty larger than I was expecting, but that was due to my own estimating, not the seller of the product. The item was delivered in a timely and orderly manner. Great product, and most importantly, it does not turn my finger green after a view times of wearing it. The seller of this product did a wonderful job! <end>  wonderful ring  we ordered this lovely little ring for our granddaughter and she loves it.good quality for the price and very fast service...it also came in a wonderful boxthank you so much. <end>  Nice & Sparkly  I got this ring as a treat after I had recently lost weight. After purchasing other rings on Amazon, I was leery however about choosing the correct sizing since the other rings I had purchased tended to run on the small side from their "size". I took a chance with this one and ordered one size too large and I was right. My jeweler sized my finger at a 7 so I ordered and 8 and it fits. Good thing with this ring as the stones are all the way around so you can't have it re-sized. The multi-colored stones are bright and pretty. The silver setting is clean and neat. This ring does not have any sense of a "cheap" look to it at all. It looks more expensive than the price paid (if maintained). You will have to clean it often as it is silver and the stones are in a closed set (my ultrasonic cleaner works fine). Overall, it's a nice addition to my collection and I really like it! <end>  my Favorite!  I love the Eternity bands, so when I saw this one I had to have it. I gave 4 stars because half sizes are not available. <end>  Pretty but best worn as a pinky ring or thumb ring  This ring is very pretty but awfully slim another words small. Yet the stones are very vibrant! For the money you can't beat it!! You may want to size up a size on ring because it seems to run a little small too. Since it's small I stacked it in with a couple of other rings and it looks good. It's not really a ring people are going to notice. <end>  slim ring but beautiful  I really like this ring. It is very slim but the stones are pretty. Love the colors. I purchased it for my pinky. It is the perfect sizefor that finger. <end>  Beautiful product!  I purchased 5 of these rings in order to wear them all together on the same finger in a stacked fashion. I only needed 4 and they look beautiful as if they were just one ring. I gave the 5th one to my sister as a birthday present and she loved it. The stones are clear and have amazing, beautiful color and the ring is crafted well. I am very pleased with my purchase! <end>  pretty ring  I gave it to a friend but I don't know if she likes it because we don't talk anymore. I loved it. <end>  For the price, it's just beautiful!  This item is much prettier than the pic. The price was very good and it was a speedy delivery.thanx for this seller.Jan <end>  Gorgeous Ring!  This ring really sparkles! It looks expensive without the expensive price! I love it! <end>  Pretty ring  This silver ring is just as pretty as it looks in the picture. It's slim and comfortable to wear, and sparkles in the light. <end>  Nice concept....good stones, but faded look after a while..  The metal looks a little cheap, and has now faded over time (I have been wearing the ring since the past 3 weeks). The stones were beautifully brillant, when it arrived, but have since, faded too.At this point in time - it is just a ring to wear, nothing more....doesn't look pretty or anything.With the price you pay, I think you shouldn't expect more. Also, who knows if you wear this ring sparingly and don't let water touch it etc. the shine might just last longer.I had asked for a size 5 and they sent a size 6, saying it was a size 5. So take care of the sizes when you order.All in all - a decent enough ring, but definitely looks cheap and cannot pass off as real anyways. As long as you know what you are getting for the amount of money, it should be fine. Do not expect anything more!The packaging was really pretty. Somehow, it took the ring 8 days to arrive after they said it was shipped....hmmmm surprising considering it wasn't even holiday season or anything. <end>  great ring  This ring is shiny and the stones have great color. I am wearing it as a thumb ring and it is very comfortable. My only negative would be that in one place the stone colors are not in order, they are clear, pink, clear, pink and then the colors are in order. <end>  Better than expected  I bought this ring for my mother for Christmas. It is very beautiful, thin, and brightly colored. I didn't know from the picture that the stones went around the whole ring but they do. We just got the rind so I cannot say for sure if it will fade or if the stones will fall out but for the price it is definetly worth buying. <end>  Horrible Quality  I sent this back the day i got it for a missing stone. When i recieved my new ring i wore it for 10 minutes and it lost two more stones. <end>  Stone Issue  I agree with other posted comments about the stones coming out, I opened the cute box, took out the ring, a stone is gone, will not return as it is not worth returning. I believe we are paying for the cute box and not the ring itself, I have a few of these types of rings from other sellers, and no stones have popped out (yet) <end>  ring review  Very nice ring, good colors, very sturdy structure. And it fits!The shipping was very fast, and the packaging was both fun and functional. And attractive! <end>  lost a stone third time I wore it  This is such a pretty ring but the third time I wore it I lost a stone. I didn't even feel like bothering to send it back, but it looks horrible and I can't wear it. If I had the stone I could fix it but it somehow fell off while I was sitting watching TV and it's somewhere in my sofa. I wouldn't spend the money on this ring. <end>  as always great job  I am slightly OCD so in the summer when I wear rings with colors other than dark red and black I like to have a tie in. It really will go with about anything, I love twisting it around on my finger to look at all the beautiful stones. I love it, and I have worn it every day since I received it. <end>  multi color chrystal rings  The rings were beautiful. I am very please and have received a lot of compliments. I would definately buy similar products in the future. <end>  Perfect for little hands  I bought two of these for my daughter. She loves it. It's little for her little hands. She loves that it's multicolored so she can pretty much wear it with anything. <end>  I love this ring  I haven't had it that long, and it's possible a stone will fall out, that's just the nature of this kind of setting. But in the meantime, it's quite cute and just what I wanted. I don't think I could be happier with it. <end>  Pretty eternity ring  I ordered and received a beautiful eternity ring with many sparkly colors. I like it a lot. For even more effect, two rings would be good. I love 'circle' rings that have color all around. And these colors are very intense. <end>  awesome little gift  I bought a ring for myself. Wore it on a cruise and ended up giving it to the little gal tending bar in the atrium. She went to the aid of a lady who fell down the stairs. She prepared an ice bag and tended her until medical aide arrived, while still taking care of her customers. The lady's family did not even thank her. She was so touched by our thanks and has even stayed in touch via e-mail.Now I have to order another one for myself. <end>  Cute sparkly ring  Love this multi-colored ring. The silver is shiny and clean. Stones are clear and perfectly cut and spaced. This is a thinner ring and exactly what I was looking for. I bought a size 9 and the fit is right. Don't hesitate - this ring looks great for the price, arrived remarkably quick from Gem Avenue and I've been very pleased. <end>  Love this ring  The ring is beautiful and priced better than I'd hoped for. I went looking for this exact ring that I'd lost and was so happy to have found it's duplicate <end>  sparkly, but uncomfortable  I liked the look of the ring from the picture, but the band itself is quite uncomfortable. The silver bands around the stones are not beveled, but stick into my finger. I had been hoping to find a ring for everyday use, but this isn't it. <end>  A ring ...  The ring was okay. I was not exactly what I was expecting, but for the price it was fine. <end>  nice  the ring was nice but the way it looked online ----I thought the stones were going to be bigger----they are very tiny---I think they should be bigger----after all they are not real genuine stones----dont know if I would order again-----lots of other places that might give me a bit more for my money------thanks, jane <end>  So far, so good!  I ordered 2 of these, and was very pleased with them. I am hard on my jewelry. If I like it, I don't take it off. Thusfar, I haven't lost any stones, and they are as beautiful as the day I bought them. I've had many fine compliments. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this vendor again. the shipping was prompt, and my items well packaged. thanks again, I love them! <end>  Prettyy...cheap  I purchased several of these rings for my daughters for Christmas. They loved the looks of them and were delighted to receive them. However, in less than a month, two of them had stones fall out. <end>  poor quality  very pretty to look at, but sad to say very poor quality. lost 2 gems within 3 weeks. service was prompt. will order better quality products from this vender next time. <end>  Buyer Beware!!!  I purchased this ring because it looked beautiful and the price was a steal. Well, I knew it would be a piece of jewelry that would not last forever; however, my experience was ridiculous. The day I received the ring it lost a stone. Within a week 2 more stones fell out. It has been about 3 weeks since I got it and I can't even wear it anymore because it's lost about 25% of its stones! The shipping for return is not worth it. <end>  pleased if I get the ring  Instantly my daughter loved the ring and so did I. Now 2wks later and the stones are coming out. I called the company and they say I have to return it for them to see it and I have to also pay another $4.99. Didnt I already pay shipping when I first ordered this ring??? <end>  Beware of the shipping rate!  The ring is really beautiful. You can just mesmerize yourself twisting the ring around and seeing the different color gems around the ring. But I have to caution. The price is a steal, but beware of the $5 shipping rate. Other than that I have no complaints. <end>  pretty for the cost  Bought this ring for my daughter and decided to keep it. Lovely colors and design for the cost. Will order from them again. So far colors are still vibrant and all stones are still in tact. Since I am so hard on my jewelry, I am surprised all the stones are still in. Good gift for teenagers!! <end>  Nice ring; great price  The ring is quite pretty and seems to maintain its sparkle. It looks good with the multi-crystal bracelet. Good choice for me and my budget! <end>  multi stone ring  I am pleased with the ring. Well worth the money. Arrived in a pretty gift box. The stones are beautiful bright colors. <end>  Ouch Rash  Gave me a horrible rash every time I wore within mintues. I am inclined to think it is cheap metal, as sterling silver doesn't give me a rash. Disappointing. <end>  A bit too think  The ring is kind of thick, but it's really pretty and no stones have fallen out of mine. Though I must warn you that the sizes run a bit large. <end>  Colors that shine!  This is by far one of the prettiest eternity bands I've seen. The colors really sparkle and are very noticable. I'm considering buying another so I can stack them. I have several single color eternity bands, and this one outshines them all! I would highly recommend this ring to anyone.I now have to revise my review. I've been wearing this for about 2 weeks, and I've lost 2 stones out of it. It's a very pretty ring, but does not hold up to daily wear. I would only recommend this for occasional wearing. <end>  So Very Cute!!  I bought this ring in a size 3 for a toe ring. It came much sooner than expected, this was the first surprise. Second surprise was the absolutely cute heart-shaped box with a bow on top that the ring came in! And the third surprise was the ring itself which fit perfectly and was totally true to the picture and looked even better in person. I'm already shopping for my second Gem Avenue ring!Kudos to Gem Avenue for supplying small rings for people who like fitted toe rings!! <end>  multicolored CZ band ring  If you purchase this product, you should at least buy two since they are small. Two or more together makes a nice look---one you can hardly see it being worn. <end>  Love It  I bought this ring to resell because it was so pretty for the price, and I am going to buy one for myself. It is really attractive and sparkly for what I paid. <end>  Stones fell out after a few months, but it is pretty  Update  After a few months of wearing it about 2 stones fell out.I got this ring only a few days ago and it is already my favorite ring. It is very colorful and catches the light really well to add a bit of sparkel. It has flat sides so you can stack rings together. <end>  Very pretty  Ring is very pretty, gemstones are all brilliant and show up very well, even though it is not a wide band. Can be worn all seasons with all colours. It can be paired with other bands for a dazzling set. <end>  Beautiful!  I have ordered 3 rings now. They are so very pretty. One for me, one for my daughter and one for my Aunt. These are high quality and really beautiful rings. I will be ordering more in the near future. <end>  Very nice ring  This is a very nice ring, especially for the price. I am completely satisfied, and it arrived in a timely fashion. I'd buy something else from this seller. <end>  Plenty of sparkle!  Very delicate but packs a punch of color. You can wear this with anything. Sure to be a real favorite. <end>  beautiful ring !  It was a good buy. Every stone was set very nicely, and I am so glad that I purchased it. <end>  Wow - so feminine and beautiful!  This ring is even more beautiful on my hand than I imagined it could be. The stones are petite and feminine with true rich colors. I love it! Thank you for such a fine quality and beautiful ring. <end>  Sterling Silver Multi Cubic Zirconia Channel Set  I had read the previous customer reviews after I purchased this ring. I was a little leary about the product because of all the negativity from the other customers. I received the ring even a little early then anticipated. I was in for a very pleasant surprise, the ring is absolutely gorgeous. For the price, it was everything I imagined and more. It may not last a lifetime and at the inexpensive cost I really wouldn't expect it to. I do want to thank Gem Avenue for a quality product. I will most definitely order from them in the future. <end>  Wonderful !  This ring is the size to mix and match your other sterling rings. Just enough "bling".Very nice ring!would recommend due to price and looks. <end>  Stones fall out  Before i bought the ring, i read the reviews and i couldn't believe something as pretty as that, could have the stones falling off, so i bought it! Three days later the ring got to my house and i wear it, some stones fall off. I'm so mad right now, because it look so pretty but is ridiculous how is the 3rd day and has a few stones missing already...  ( <end>  So CUTE!  I can wear this ring with almost any outfit. It has a lot of classic colors in it that make it possible to accessorize with a lot of clothes. THis ring shipped quickly from a third party shipper. <end>  Shiny! Sparkly! Blingy! and at a great price!  This is a really great ring. I admit, as with the other rings I've ordered, I had low expectations. I was very wrong. I was surprised at how really pretty this ring is. You can't see the shiny/sparkly in the picture. You also can't see how neat and even the stones are sitting in the metal. It is slightly more colorful than the picture (or maybe it's my monitor) without being gaudy. If you want a lot of bling at a little price then buy this ring. It would make a good thumb ring as well as a good right hand stacker - or add it to a solitaire and make an even better wedding set. I would give this as a gift most definitely! <end>  This is my grandma's ring  My grandma (76 years old) decided she wanted a new ring on a whim. She's the kind of woman who prefers "flat" rings; rings that don't have any frilly stuff sticking out of it. While I looked on here for ones that met her criteria, this was one of the options & the one she liked best.It arrived in good time & she wore it that entire day. She hasn't worn it since, saying only, "I'll wear it on special occasions because I cherish it." (Oh, grandmas...)I examined it & thought it looked cheap, which is what you get for the price, but she loved it so much that I didn't say a word. She especially loves the cute little box it came in. (She loves miniature things, so this is not surprising, lol.)By the looks of it, I would NOT wear it while working, or doing other things that make heavy use of your hands. While none of the stones have fallen out of her ring, I have no doubt that if she does something unexpected, a stone will fall out while she wears it. The crystals do not look as pretty as they do in the picture posted here. They look immensely fake, & they look CHEAP. There is very little sparkle or shine, which is regrettable, but since my grandma likes this ring, that's all that matters. (I've posted pictures of the ring & the box it came in in the gallery so you can see for yourself.)In essence, buyer beware when purchasing this ring. I'd actually recommend that you look elsewhere if you want a decent ring for daily use, because this ring is NOT made for that. In my own opinion, it's best suited as a gift for young children (before they hit their tweens). <end>  I love my band!  This band is absolutely beautiful. The sterling looks just like white gold, amazing. The stones look real. I am so glad, I wear it everyday. It suits anything you wear, casual to dressed up. Fantastic ring. Thank you!Lucie <end>  A sterling silver rainbow ring  This lovely ring is delicate in design, but with all the colors of the rainbow. It can be worn by itself, with a simple band, or stacked. Accurate sizing, nice weight and presentation. Love the gift box, too - they are a treasure in themselves! Great value <end>  Opinion  It is an excellent product, a nice ring. Buy this product and although I live in the U.S. came to Colombia with no problem, thanks to good service from Gem Avenue and my international courier company. I will continue doing business with you. <end>
 B000GWUN36  8mm Wide Mens and Womens Titanium Black Enameled Celtic Knot Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Let's be real ...  The look of these rings are not for everyone. I had never had a titanium ring before, and was surprised by it's light wieght - so much so that I couldn't help shake the feeling it was a plastic ring my kids would wear.An 8mm wide ring is also very big ... take a real close look at this ring before buying. I'm looking for a different one now ...I tried to increase the rating of my review (from 2 stars to 4) but apparently this is not possible.The reason for this is simply because of the great return policy Silver Insanity has - would recommend them for a ring purchase. No hassles ... <end>  Nice ring  The ring came in a timely manner wrapped in a nice velvet pouch. However, it is a bit rough around the edges and it did not stay the silver color as the picture shows, it is more of a brushed gold color. <end>  Great Ring for the Price.  I purchased this ring as an anniversary gift for my husbad. He was very shy about wearing a ring after we got married because he breaks everything.. and he didnt want to break his weddng ring.. So i got this with the intention to get him used to the idea of wearing one.. but I must say this ring is gorgeous and it turned out that he liked this one better than the 600 dollar one at the Jewelry store. The enamel eventually started chipping out of this ring, but it peeled off easy and looked even better without the ring.. I would say definately get this ring.. it is worth every penny. <end>  titanium  I lost my wedding ring, But my other half said those magical words I got you !! so on the hunt i went For the one wring no sorry wrong book any way i found these titanium rings the stuff of Tanks and Jet fighters and Industrial tools were now rings they both were perfect! Thanks! <end>  Perfect Celtic Knot Ring  I just recieved this and I know my husband will be pleased. It has a brushed titanium look with an etched black enameled celtic knot. Nicely done. <end>
 B000GWZ8DQ  Sterling Silver Concave Anchor Link Necklace 24" ||	  Impressive  It is a massive chain, did not expect to be so wide. Purchased as a gift - very successful. <end>
 B000GX34IG  Sterling Silver Heart Stud Earrings ||	  Very pleased  I bought these as a gift for my mom. I was really surprised when I received them. They're very sturdy, not hollow like some earings. A really good size. Worth the price. Definitely recommend them! <end>  Very good for the price  I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. ONE OF THE EARRINGS WAS A LITTLE LOSE, BUT FIXED IT MY SELF AND I GAVE THEM TO MY GIRLFRIEND AND SHE LOVE THEM <end>
 B000GX386O  RANDY ORTON DOG TAG WWE PENDANT (NECKLACE) ||	  dog tag  good, solid product- received in time for giving as a gift- recommend highly as a present or for daily enjoyment <end>
 B000GX7OW8  14K Rolo Link Bracelet 7.2" ||	  Just what I was looking for.  I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's just what I was looking for, a simple white gold chain link bracelet. The size (7.2") is perfect for me and the weight is good (apx. 5 grams). I was relieved to find that all of the links including the ones on the clasp are soldered closed, and the 'flat' links attached to the clasp are stamped 14K on one side and (I assume) the jewelry manufacturer's initials on the other side, giving it a classy little look. The merchant (Netaya) provided excellent communication regarding shipping, and I received this item in just a few days. I feel it's a pretty good deal. I looked all over and couldn't find anything comparable for this price (apx. 150 bucks). I would def buy from this merchant again! <end>  Simple but pretty  This bracelet is well made and well weighted. It is a simple classic bracelet that will go with everything. I, unfortunately had to return mine. The 7.2 " size was a bit too small for my taste. I usually wear a 7.5". I was bummed as I really like it. Good quality for a really good price at the time ($109). <end>
 B000GX7PMW  Sterling Silver Striped Beaded Bracelet - 7.5" ||	  Very nice!  I wasn't sure about this bracelet when I ordered it. It was priced at 19.99 then so I was afraid it would feel cheap.I was totally wrong! It is very nice. It has a good weight to it, nice clasp, I didn't fear it would get dinged or dented even though silver is a softer metal.Arrived in a nice little velour bag, wrapped around a faux leather pillow with a "certificate of authenticity". I didn't hesitate to give this one as a gift to a dear friend.One word of caution...it is a little bit under 7.5", so if you have a larger wrist don't get this one or be prepared to use an extender. <end>  Beautiful Bracelet  This is a very pretty bracelet. Actually nicer than expected. It is exactly as pictured. Fits great. A little hard to get on because it fits pretty tight. I put it on and left it on since it's sterling silver it wont turn color and I've been wearing it 24/7 for over a month now and it's still shiny and gorgeous. I get lots of compliments. The picture actually doesn't do the piece justice. And the price? What a deal!!! <end>  Very nice...get the necklace, too!  Got the matching graduated bead necklace to go with this bracelet. Both are very nice. Strung on a sterling necklace, not some cheap string which makes them very sturdy. The beads have very nice detail and are not hollow so you don't have to worry about denting. The only reason I gave this 4 stars...although it does measure 7.5 inches, it is very tight on my 6.75 inch wrist. I will get an extender for it...still well worth the price. <end>  Never seen this item, (Amazon sent after initial review??)  I wonder now about the reviews I have read. I wrote revoews on items I had purchased then several more items (I have never seen came up) for review. What is going on?NEVER SEEN THIS ITEM CERTANLY NEVER BOUGHT IT <end>
 B000GX9P8E  2.00 Carat Diamond Tennis Bracelet - 7" (J-K,I2-I3) ||	  I returned it  Meh, You get what you pay for. I returned it and bought something nice. <end>
 B000GX9PNE  Sterling Silver Bracelet w/ Moon and Heart Charms - 7" ||	  A good gift  Product came packaged really nice, quick shipping, not as crisply brilliant as what you see in the pictures. A nice gift to give away to someone, I would not buy it for a close person. <end>
 B000GXCYFU  Sterling Silver & Diamond Hearts Bracelet - 7.5" ||	  have not received it  i have not received this item .i am currently waiting for an answer from an e-mail i sent and have not received that either. I cant rate the product but i can rate the company poor at gettng back to customers ! <end>  Do get fool  Hi every body don't get fool by cheap price,when they say its real diamonds on the Hearts Bracelet.Because if it was it wouldn't be for twenty nine dollars and some cents.I use too work for a Jewelry company.Those probably or crystal or diamond accent. It two total different things. <end>  Good product...  I thought the bracelet was very nice. It arrived before it was expected to, which was a bonus. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the picture was a little mis-leading. I thought that the links between the hearts had diamonds all along the band, not just a little one in the middle. <end>  Hearts Bracelet  Bought it for my son's girlfriend she loves it. Both are very happy with the bracelet and we bought the necklace that matches also. <end>  Not what I expected...  It's ok, but looks a little cheap (even though it is) and it's too big and heavy for what I was looking for. I do not believe this costs $124.00 as retail price. The diamonds are not even noticeable and do not shine at all. <end>  Poor Quality Equals Unhappy Consumer  I was very disappointed the first time they sent me this product because the quality of the diamonds was horrible. Most of the diamonds had huge scratches in them, and a couple of them were completely crushed. Although nothing was wrong with the sterling silver hearts and the piece was heavy, I had to send it back for a replacement because of the diamonds. The piece they sent me as a replacement was much better, but many of the diamonds had noticable scratches on them. I will never purchase anything from them again because I believe their diamonds would be low quality like the jewelry they sent me. <end>  Very Nice Bracelet for the Price!  Bought this for the Christmas/Holiday gift stash, and it's substantial without being too clunky. It's lovely in design and well-made. The diamonds aren't large or necessarily noticeable, but I didn't expect them to be for the price. Gram weight of sterling silver is good. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the clasp is tricky to put on the bracelet one-handed. Good gift idea, though! <end>  Heart Bracelet  I purchased three of these hearts bracelets for my three daughters for Christmas. They are very pretty and they loved them. The quality is good for price. <end>  Excellent item, she loved it  Great item, don't go looking for huge diamonds, but it looked good over all. And my girlfriend loved it so I guess that's the most important thing. <end>  Not real silver  I bought this product and when it arrived it looked different to all my sterling silver bracelets, I would be very surprised if its real silver. More like stainless steel and I ditto everything said about the diamonds. Barely there. Totally not worth the money. <end>  DIAMOND HEART BRACELET  THIS HEART DIAMOND BRACELET IS VERY CUTE!! THE PRICE IS PERFECT FOR ME. IT BOTHERS ME WHEN PEOPLE SHARE THERE REVIEW AND THEY SAY THE BRACELET LOOKS CHEAPS !!! NOT AT ALL TRUE!! I DON'T THINK U PEOPLE WHO WRITE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!! U NEED TO REALIZE IT'S NOT GONNA BE REAL THE DIAMONDS OR BIG!! AS OTHER WORDS U PAY FOR WHAT U GET!! I U SPEND MORE MONEY U WILL GET REAL DIAMONDS ANYTHING $500.00OR MORE U WILL GET CUBIC ZIRCONIA FOR $150.00 OR LESS SO THEY R RIGHT ABOUT THE RETAIL PRICE AND THERE NOT TELLING U THE DIAMONDS R REAL THEY R GIVING U A RETAIL PRICE . THIS IS A VERY CUTE ADORABLE BRACELET WELL MADE !! I LIKE THE HEART SHAPE! PERFECT FOR A TEENAGER !! GRADUATION GIFT OR BIRTHDAYGIFT ABSOUTLY A PRETTY BRACELET AND WORTH BUYING. KC <end>  Very Pleased!  I bought this bracelet for my wife, and she loved it! Bracelet looks very nice.I'm very pleased with my purchase. Thanks for a nice and affordable jewelry. <end>  Beautiful and Excellent  This is a gorgeous bracelet! The only issue I have with it is the clamp being so difficult to open. <end>  Bracelet  I was not happy at all with this product. It does not look at all like the picture. It doesnt sparkle at all (I do not even see any diamonds on it). The clasp does not close all the way, which makes the bracelet fall off.I was not satisfied at all, I would have never paid $50 for it if I saw it at a store. I emailed the company and never recieved a response back. I ended up returning the item, I just hope I do not have issues with them returning my money.Not only that but the delivery of the product took forever. I got it a few days before Christmas. Since it was a gift it would have been nice to get it earlier, but since I didn't I had to run out on Christmas Eve to get that person another gift. <end>
 B000GXISIW  Pugster Green Fashion Jewelry Seasonal Party Styles Murano Glass Pendant Necklace & ||	  Amazing!  I really loved the jewlery but was a little nervous because no reviews. I ordered my necklace and braclete on 11/18 and recieved today 11/22 It was actually a lot earlier then expected!!! But very great customer service! I will be buying more from them diff <end>
 B000GXO96M  Pugster Christmas 925 Sterling Silver Diamond Accent Winter Snowflake Pendant Necklace 18" ||	  Great value....  Just beautiful, A lovely necklace for the winter months. Looks gorgeous on black. You will get many compliments on this necklace. <end>
 B000GXUW1S  10mm Wide Embossed Celtic Knot Pattern Titanium Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Survived being run over by a car....  Very durable ring. Ran over it with my civic, bent it a bit, but very easy for a jeweler to put it back into shape. <end>  i haven't taken it off since i got it  i've always loved celtic knot-work patterns and i was immediately drawn to this ring. i know most people would be using it as a wedding band, but i find it works beautifully as an every day ring, in fact i haven't taken it off since i got it. i was more than pleasantly surprised at the colour of the metal - sort of gun metal grey with highlights of bright silver. and it only gets more beautiful as you wear it. the ring is a little thick, so it takes a little time to get used to, but it's well worth it. <end>  A little rough around the edges  Love the design and feel of the ring. Originally ordered the wrong size but customer service was great handling the return. The only downside is the edges of the ring are rough. <end>  Awesome company  Shop at this site. Bought this item times two because we wanted new wedding bands. The items shipped fast. Had to return for a different size and exchange was no problem. Have the new ones and love them. Can't wait to shop at silver insanity again. Quality and service top-notch. <end>  Disappointed in Size Nine  This ring in a size nine doesn't come with the lighter middle section and trust me it matters. Don't buy a size nine if you need a matching set. Other than that it's a nice ring. <end>
 B000GY4F9M  Amazon.com  Big Daddy Four-Finger Ring (As Shown;One Size)  Clothing ||	  Junk. Plastic. Broken when it arrived.  We were going to a 70's disco party and I thought this BIG DADDY ring would look great. The ring is actually plastic, no metal...and the part that attaches on to you was damaged in shipping. It's junk. <end>  Terrible product  This item is no good!!!!! Could't even wear the ring, The bands that go on your fingers are uneven and are suppose to be adjustable yet they were not <end>  Does the job...  What can you really say about a glittery 4-finger pimp costume ring that says "Big Daddy"? It works well as a Pimp costume accessory. However, it took some time to bend open the small rings just to make them fit onto my regular-sized men's fingers. Only a child or small lady could have gotten the ring on otherwise. Looks good, but the glitter came off a little bit in some places as I struggled to make the ring fit. <end>  It immediately fell apart upon opening package  I took it out of the package and 3 of the 4 rings fell off. So, that was disappointing. Wenever got to use it. It looked fun in the package <end>  Crap  This ring cannot be worn - it is only for show. It is plastic and the finger holders will break as soon as you attempt to slide this ring on. <end>
 B000GYEUR4  WIDE CUBIC ZIRCONIA CROSS CUT OUT BAND, 9 ||	  Not as nice as the photo  I know this is an inexpensive ring but it looks so much more 'cheap' than the photo online. Save your money. <end>
 B000GZ7CE6  PalmBeach Jewelry Multi-Color Cultured Freshwater Pearl Sterling Silver Link Necklace 18&quot; ||	  Not a good quality of Pearls  I ordered this necklace for christmas last year for my mother-n-law thinking it was going to be a good quality set of pearls but it was very cheap looking. Don't buy this product. It had dried up 'glue' still stained around each pearl. The price of the necklace doesn't match the quality, neither does the picture on this site. Stay Away!! <end>
 B000GZKGDU  14K White Gold 1.20ctw. Three-Stone Diamond Ring with Sidestones - (I-J;I1-I2) ||	  GREAT GOO  This Ring is GREAT!!! the wifey to be loves it and would'nt trade it for any other ring she's seen. Believe me she says this ALL THE TIME. its almost getting old really, she likes it that much that i hear about it all the time. so Dont get this ring if you dont like hearing how awesome and insightfull you are for getting her the ring shes always wanted. but if you do... buy it. <end>
 B000GZONNO  14K White Gold 1 1/3 ctw. Princess Cut Three-Stone Diamond Ring - (I-J;I1-I2) Size 10 ||	  My wife loved it!  I really like the idea of the smaller diamonds flanking the larger one. It sparkles in the light and pairs nicely with a wedding band with 5 little diamonds across the top. Everything is in place and seems like a solid ring.My wife uses lotion and like all rings even if your careful it will fade to yellow a little over the years. My ring also with the Rhodium plating never faded as i don't use lotion. <end>  Slowest Order!  I've been purchasing products from Amazon for a long time and this is by far the worst experience to date. The product is nice but it took 3 weeks to receive it. I purchased the expedited shipping method to surprise my girlfriend for mothers day, but it still took almost 3 weeks to process this order. I highly recommend contacting the seller for processing details. <end>
 B000H0I7N0  Purple Glow Cat's Eye Crystal Stretch Bracelet ||	  What a surprise!  I bought this bracelet because of the inexpensive price. Therefore, I didn't expect a lot from it. Well, what a surprise! The crystals are quite sparkly. The purple glow cat's eye beads are not all the same sizes, but that wasn't really my concern. The real bracelet looks more sophisticated than the photo online. I love purple and I know I will wear this bracelet a lot!! <end>
 B000H0K3HS  Tri-Color Cultured Pearl Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Stem Brooch Pin ||	  Great Looking Pin  Got this pin for my mother for her birthday & she absolutely loves it. She comes from an era that appreciates these smaller but tasteful accent pieces.It has her birthstone that's set in a very attractive curved wire design, plus the "jewelry box" packaging adds to the overall presentation. Can't go wrong with this one. <end>
 B000H0Q6T2  Cultured Pearl Platinum or Gold Overlay Sterling Silver Hook Bunch Earrings - Various Pearl Colors ||	  Grape pods.  I gave this as a gift, but it is so beautiful. My daughter really loves them. They match a previous gift from Amazon. <end>  Delicate, lovely and expensive looking.  My favorite pair of pearl earrings kept losing pearls. I have been looking for something similar for years. Having given up on the button cluster posts, I started looking for other kinds of clusters not reliant on glue. These caught my eye and have not disappointed. They are quite lovely and have an appeal similar to the ones I could not keep together. <end>  Beautiful  I purchased these for my mom for Christmas. They really are pretty. They lay and move very nicely and are a good length for dangly earrings. Big enough to be noticed but not so long as to be gaudy. <end>  DONT MEASURE UP  I bought a lovely necklace that Amazon featured this set of earrings as well as a bracelet with as a "buy together for" deal. I was SO incredibly disappointed with these earrings! These were described as 4-5 mm, and the length 1.75". The image alone is deceiving. The actual "pearl" portion is only 1" long (see images I uploaded). If the seller had featured a picture of them being worn, I would have seen the pearls & overall earrings were much smaller. My husband, an engineer, measured the pearls with a caliper and found they were 3 mm at best, only 2 were 4 mm. The freshwater pearl necklace (from a different seller) looks NOTHING like these earrings and together look mismatched so I gave the earrings to my teenage daughter. For a 16 year old, these are fine, but I wouldn't rate these earrings better than any fake set you could buy at Claire's. I think I'm done purchasing jewelry on Amazon.com unless they start requiring sellers to post more images, especially of the item worn. <end>  Beautiful  I bought these earrings for my mother for Christmas. They were so pretty! First off, they came in a very nice box. When I opened it I was very pleased with the quality of the pearls and the workmanship. I feel like I got a lot more than I paid for. My mother loved them and they looked so nice on. I highly recommend this product and this seller. They have great quality and they ship quickly and in nice packaging. You can't ask for more! <end>  EXCELLENT!  I received my earrings a day after I ordered. The service is fast and the product is better. I'm 100% satisfied with these earrings. They are lustrous, and I can't stop looking at them!! <end>  Adorable - dress up or dress down  I received these for Mother's Day and love them. They are nicely made and have the right amount of dangle to be feminine and fun. The pearls have a nice luster and are smooth. The silver is shiny and well matched to the pearls. I would highly recommend these cute earrings. I wore them with jeans on the first day and got tons of compliments. <end>  Fabulous!  These earrings are absolutely beautiful. They were much more than I expected for the price and at this price you really cant beat it! I would definetly recommend! <end>  Gorgeous earrings  My husband surprised me with these earrings. I love them. I've gotten so many compliments on them that I'm thinking on getting the peach ones too. I love black pearls, and these just look gorgeous. The value is great and you won't be disappointed. They look at least as good as in the picture. <end>  look as great as photo--or better  These really look very beautiful! I was afraid they might look too big or heavy, but they are just perfect--very delicate! <end>  very pretty; glad the seller has listened to feedback!  I really like the earrings, though the other reviewer was correct--they are smaller than what the image/height stat. suggested. So I'm really pleased that there are new images up with a measurement guide to avoid future confusion. But overall, I'm pleased. <end>  Nice job  I love my earrings and the service was great. I would recommend the site to my friends. Great overall.White Cultured Pearl Bunch Earrings <end>  Beautiful earrings, and nice quality  I purchased these earrings as a gift for my daughter. They arrived quickly and were a perfect match for necklace, which she already has. They are a very nice quality. The color is fantastic! We are very happy with the purchase. <end>
 B000H0R6A0  14k Yellow Gold "Sweet 16" Charm ||	  Adorable charm!  I have to say this charm is much more attractive in person and the perfect gift!The workmanship of the gold is much more crisp in person and has an expensive look to it. The size of the charm is also larger than I imagined and I believe this could be worn as a pendant, or cute as a larger charm on a bracelet.All-in-all this will make a nice memento to commemorate her special day and to remember for years to come by glancing in her jewelry box. <end>
 B000H0TM6G  14k Yellow Gold Turtle Charm ||	  14 kt gold turtle charm  This charm looks nice but it turned out that the one i received has some slight differences to the one in the photo  Mine has a smaller head than the loop above the head. Also the gold is not a deep gold color like it appears to be on the picture, it is a med-light color. Also the body of the turtle is not evenly rounded, rather a slightly bent- over body . So Overall the charm is very nice but I imagined it to be a darker gold, and more rounded, and a slightly thicker body, that the one I received. <end>
 B000H1SOO6  Sterling Silver Heart CZ Necklace with 18 inch Snake Chain, Red ||	  Looks good in person  I've bought some jewelry online in the past that doesn't look as good in person. This necklace looked better in person than it did in the picture. <end>
 B000H235LM  Black TOP DROP Heart TATTOO Belly Ring ||	  Not received  Dear Mrs./Mr.,please note that I still did not receive my order!Thank you in advance for letting me know what happened and where is the problem.Best regards,Zuzana <end>  I love body candy but this is not one of my favorite body pieces  The item doesn't hang right unless maybe you have a prefect stomach. I really like the pattern but it is a top drop which makes it funky. <end>
 B000H3BMCU  Rosewood Glossy Finish Jewelry Ring Display Storage Case ||	  Beautiful Rosewood Glossy Jewelry Ring Display Case  The case is beautiful, and made very well. The Ring "Rods" are made for the smaller ring sizes - if you want rings to show face up. Rings size 8 and up will lay to the side or go underneath the rod. Just an FYI, but it does not take away from beauty of the case, but I don't think I would count on it as a main display case. <end>  A Jewel of a Jewelry Box  I bought this as a Christmas gift and could not be more pleased! This is every good as the picture and description suggest - maybe better.... It is just perfect. It even has a removable lid - which may not be what someone else likes but was an added bonus for the new owner. I will trust other items from this seller as the product was top quality yet reasonably priced. A real bargin considering the junk out there.... <end>  well made and beautifully finished  Rosewood Glossy Finish Jewelry Ring Display Storage CaseThis product is a wonderfully finished and well made piece. The ring holders are removeable and hold rings securely. The box when closed is a work of art. The rosewood is flawless and the finish is impeccable. The top of the box is removable and is a half barrel and pin hinge so that when the box is open it easily slides up and off the box. When it is in any other position it remains securely attached to the box. Very clever. <end>  Not What I Expected  If your ring size is larger than 8, this is not the product for you. Any size larger than 8 does not slide onto the holders and keep the ring straight. <end>  It's great for the most part  I love the size of the box, and the color is beautiful. It definately holds a lot of rings. The strange thing is that the cover does not attach completely to the bottom. Therefore each time that I open the box, the cover comes off. That just seems a bit strange to me. But for the most part I love it. <end>  A Fitting Complement to Jewelry  For my wife, I purchased this rosewood ring case. Little did I know that it would readily become a favorite of hers to contain and showcase her rings. The external portion of the case is rosewood and the case is hinged in such a manner so that the lid separates from the base; thus, allowing the base to become a showcase, of sorts, for the rings contained therein. The ring holders permit adequate support of the rings to hold them in place and showcase them to their fullest extent. For travel, the cover and lid interlock well and keep the contents safe and secure. The case is a fitting complement to any and all rings, no matter how expensive the latter may be. It is a very good purchase for the money and a reliable container for one's precious jewelry. <end>  Great for people who LOVE rings!  I love the wood used and the look of this box. The ability to hold a large number of rings is great because I'm a rabid collector.Only 2 problems. 1) mandrels are too thick for smaller size rings (which I have alot of - my fingers are little) and larger rings that I wear on my thumb slip around and lay upside down. 2) Also was shocked that cover comes off. I'd prefer hinges that kept it attached.My recommendation for improvement. Include mandrels of different thicknesses. 2 for rings of small size (5 and under), 2 or 3 for larger rings (9-11) and the rest for those middle sizes inbetween.Still, it's great for keeping a quantity of jewelry in a relatively small space. Easily portable also! <end>  Great seller!  Product came in perfect condition, looked exactly like the picture, and arrived very quickly. I was highly impressed, would definately buy from this seller again! <end>  Ring case  The case was very nice and well put together. The lock works very good. The only thing I found was that the space for the rings was a little wide for some so it would not hold them in place. <end>  Well done!  The ring jewelry box arrived as purchased with no issues.The product quality was very good and very classy. My wife was very impressed when she opened it for Christmas. The finish on the case is a very rich looking cherry wood. The white padding is very soft and should protect all her rings. <end>
 B000H48EC0  14k Yellow Gold Golf Bag and Clubs Charm ||	  very detailed  I was please with the detail, size and weight of the charm. Three dimentional. <end>
 B000H4C5AW  Sterling Silver Reindeer Brooch ||	  Cute...but that's it.  Amazon, get out of the jewelry biz. Some things should not be peddled on the internet. This was a nice little piece but really, a bit of the same stuff can be bought at any fall carnival stand and be better quality. Being cheap and dirty is not what your image is. Stop trying to go there. There is lots of places on the internet to get junk. Don't be one of them. <end>
 B000H5MZ8I  Gorgeous! Women's 14k White-gold 7.50 MM =1 1/2 CT Moissanite Solitaire Engagement Ring ||	  Simplistic perfection  I purchased this ring about 2 months ago and I love it more now. I wanted a change from my 1 ct. pear shaped engagement ring and this is perfect. The setting is identical and the sparkle is amazing. It's large enough to be noticed but not too large as to look fake. I love the fact that it is the moissanite and therefore no worry that it might be a conflict diamond. Now I'm looking for a moissanite band to go with it. <end>  GORGEOUS!!!  This ring is soooooooooooo beautiful!!! The cut and finishes are amazing!!!! I didn't know it was moissanite until my husband told me. I get so many compliments on this ring everywhere I go. It really stands out and sparkle! <end>
 B000H644QS  Sterling Silver and Genuine Blue Topaz Pear Shaped Post Stud Earrings ||	  Very Pretty  I bought these for a Christmas present and almost kept them for myself. The only thing that would have improved this purchase was if it had come in a gift box (they came in a small Ziploc bag). <end>
 B000H6DWZC  Fairy Tale Jewelry Box ||	  nice  My sweet tiny little Grandaughter with her golden curls just loved it. Then she took it outside, filled it with rocks and ran the hose in it. OOOOh well, <end>  Pretty jewelry box  This is a very pretty jewelry box for a young girl. The fairies, flowers, ladybugs and butterflies on the outside are lovely - better than I expected. The sound of the music box is slightly tinny, but not bad, and the dancing fairy inside is pretty. It seems to be pretty well built - only time will tell. <end>  Very Nice  It was a gift for a young girl and she loved it. She keep all her jewelry in it. Great gift. <end>  I loved it.  My granddaughter loved it. It was perfect. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a little girl in their life. <end>  She loves it!  I gave this jewelry box to my four year old niece on her birthday. She absolutely loves it and now falls asleep to it every night. It was a big hit with her! <end>  cheap box  Cheap cardboard box, painted pretty, & a music box. I guess for a young child(3&#62;4 year old) it is OK. IF you want something quality, this isn't it. It is more of a toy than a jewelry box. <end>  So much cuter in person  I ordered 2 of these boxes for my nearly 3 year old and 4 year old daughters. I think they could be given to girls that are a bit older as well. This box might be my new go-to gift for little girls. The boxes are really so cute. The turn mechanism is really durable, the spring inside with a fairy spinning is really durable and seems strong. The music is loud and clear. I am really happy to give these to my girls as their first jewelry box. I ordered them based on the price and expected they would be heavy cardboard but I am pleasantly surprised by how strong they are. <end>  cheaper else where  I saw this tiny jewel box for $4.99 at Home Goods. The idea that they want $17 for it is , wow, for something so small. <end>  Great Gift!  This is an absolutely adorable jewelry box. This is the type of jewelry box I always wanted when I was a kid. I had several pretty jewelry boxes but never got one that had a little figure and music. When my niece asked for one for her birthday I jumped at the chance to get her one. She was thrilled to receive it and it worked well when we opened it. <end>  Music box  every little girl's dream for her 'crown jewels'...absolutely adorable. Can't wait for the little gal to open it!~ <end>  Good Value for Kids  I got this jewelry box for my 3 year old. She carries it everywhere and loves it. It has stood up to the normal abuse that a small child gives and still is going. The music is nice and not too loud. I would say that this is a great first jewelry box for any little girl. <end>  Child's Jewelry Box  My 4 year old specifically asked for a jewelry box for her birthday and I bought her this one. She loves it. It's just a simple, nicely decorated music box and worth what I paid for it. Seems durable enough but will not hold a lot of items but it holds enough to suit her. <end>  Pretty Music Box  This is a pretty little box that I got my 5 y/o daughter for her costume jewelry. She loves to twist it and watch the fairy twirl around whenever she opens it. Reminds me of a similar music box I had at her age. Very cute and worth the money, but can't really say how durable it will be since we just got it. <end>  Great jewelry box!  We bought this for our daughter's 4th birthday, and it was one of her favorite gifts. She loves putting special things in it (and her jewelry, of course).I've been surprised, because it is VERY durable. Our two-year-old wants to play with it anytime she goes in her sister's room. And our toddler is a bit rough with it, but the box, fairy figure, and musical pieces are all in great shape. It's been nearly a year now with both kids playing with it almost daily.We looked at several before buying this one, but the price was great, and it's been a big hit for both our girls. I'm very glad we bought it. <end>  good price/quality  Bought this as a gift for my 8 year old. It seems to be exactly as described. The quality is good for the price. My daughter loves it and it seems to have a fairly decent space for her to keep her jewelry and treasures in. <end>  It's just a jewelry Box  My daughter received this for Christmas and loved it. It's a day later and no longer plays music. She still likes it for keeping her earrings, but the magic of opening the lid to see the fairy spin is gone. <end>  beautiful jewelry box!  It is not very durable, but sooo pretty. My 2 years old daughter loves dancing girl and music. We keep pins and rubber bands inside. It keeps her busy while I'm making her hair. Love it! <end>  A little bit chintzy  Bought 2 of these music boxes at once. Both played the melody off key. The dancer inside one box would not turn or play music unless you manually began turning it. Pretty, and nice for a child who is gentle. <end>  Fairy Tale Jewelry Box  I bought this jewelry box for my 3 y.o. granddaughter mainly to help her take her nap listening to its music rather than requiring someone to have to lay down with her till she falls asleep. It worked! And she loves it! She winds the music box up herself a few times until she falls asleep. It appears to be as sturdy as a jewelry box can be and is very pretty and colorful. The little fairy that spins when the music box plays is really cute also. We are very pleased with this purchase and makes a great first musical jewelry box for a little girl. <end>  Fairy Tale Jewelry Box  I purchased this jewelry box for my 5 year old niece for her b-day. It exceeded my exceptations.It has great music box with beautiful artwork and a spending fairy.It's cute and durable. She absolutely LOVED it! I'm going to buy several more for the other girls. <end>  music box is great  This music box is great my 2 year old granddaughter was so excited. It has good sound but is not cheap looking. Still it's not so expensive that if the 2 year old breaks it, its not a big deal <end>  Functional and Fun to Collect.  I grew up with many of these jewelry music boxes as a kid and always enjoyed receiving them. Yes, the quality of the latch and the cardboard-like box seems to be a turn off, but that's just how these particular type of boxes are made. It's as good as I expected it to be. <end>  very cute  I really love this music box, cute ornament with nice dress and nice music. Lots of space for all my jewelry makings. <end>  Favorite Xmas gift for a 2 yr. old!  I sent this to my 2 year old grandaughter as one of her Xmas gifts. According to her Mother it is the absolute favorite gift she got (and she got a ton of great gifts). She called me on the phone and said "I love it!" Perfect gift for a little girl. It is old fashioned and special. Not too expensive if it ever gets damaged. <end>  Special Gift  I bought this for my little 5 yr old Grand-daughter and she loved it. Keeps her special things in her room. It is very cute. You do have to instruct them that you don't open it too many times, as I am not sure how long the little figurine will last. Fun while it does! <end>  Fairy Tale Jewelry Box  Best jewelry box in age group. Wish it was bigger, great fairy! Art work is wonderful. My two year old grand daughter loves it and seems to be unable to break it. <end>  4 year old daughter delighted  Bought this for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. She was thrilled and has been using it quite a bit for storing her "keepsakes" over the past months. It's held up well; would buy it again. <end>  My Daughter Loves It!  My daughter got this for Christmas and loves this music box. It has plenty of room for her little treasures and she loves winding it up to listen to the music and watch the fairy dance. The only durability issue was that the wind-up key came detached, but we were able to screw it back on and used some super glue to make sure it didn't come off again (it hasn't). She absolutely loves it! <end>  Just like I remembered!  I purchased for my daughter's 3rd birthday. It is reminiscent of the one I had as a little girl. She absolutely loves it. It is as durable as I can recall at that age. Smaller than I thought. Would definitely recommend purchasing if you had one as a little girl and remember yours. <end>  Granddaughter loved it  My granddaughter loved it. I did not realize that it would be so small but she is just keeping her earrings in it. <end>  I really liked it.  I got this for my daughter and I don't think it was exactly what she was wanting. I really liked it and thought it was pretty and functional for her needs. I enjoyed it more than my daughter did. <end>  Good quality for the price  The music box is quite sturdy, considering the modest price. I would have appreciated knowing what piece of music was a part of the music box before I purchased it, but other than that, the item lived up to expectations. The shipment was received promptly and the packaging was appropriate to protect the music box and mechanism. <end>  This was broken!  This was a beautiful box, but the music does not work and I see no way to try and open it up to fix it without destroying the item altogether. My return window is already past, so I can't even return it! Now I need to find a functioning music box for my daughter's birthday as a replacement. I bought early and didn't test it first- big mistake!  ( <end>  Perfect for any little girl  I wish I had captured on film my daughter's face when she first opened this precious jewelry box - pure awe and joy! She plays with it every day, keeps her treasures inside, dances to the music, and stares at her very own "tiny dancer" as she twirls round and round. I give this 4 stars because it could be more durable - the outside has a few dents, but only after much use. Considering the price, this music box is an excellent value and something any little girl would love. <end>  magical  the images are of vibrant colors, and the music magical. my daughter's face lit up when she opened the box! <end>  fairy jewelry box  for my toddler who loves music boxes and fairies. easy for her to open and close repeatedly. she enjoys playing with it. if she breaks it, not big deal it didn't cost much! <end>  Great fairy jewel box.  My grandaughter loved this jewel box. She loves fairies so the fairies on the outside and the dancing fairy inside was a big hit. <end>  Very cute!  I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it! I do keep it in a hard to reach place, but every now and then, she takes it out (guess it wasn't too hard to reach). It holds up much better than I thought it would and so far I am pleased. We've had it for 6 months with no issues and serves it general purpose. <end>  Sweet gift for a little girl.  My two-year-old granddaughter just opened this sweet little music jewelry box I recently bought for her. She really loved it! She's able to wind and then open the box to see the little fairy twirl around and dance to the music. So far, this gift seems to be a hit! <end>  Nice jewelry box for a good value  I purchased this as a gift for my daughter's friend's 5th birthday. It was what I expected -- pretty, a bit on the small side and delicate. Overall, I think it's a fair price for a nice, little jewelry box for a little girl without much jewelry. <end>  A must have for a little girl!  I purchased this for my 4 yr old. She loves it and listens to the music nonstop. It looks just like the one I had when I was younger. Also, for the price, if it does break, it's not a big deal. I plan on getting another one when my youngest is old enough. <end>  jewelry box  Got as a gift for grand daughter. She loves it. It plays a really cute little tune. Its a little cheap but for the money a great deal and holds alot of jewelry. <end>  a little girl's happiness ....  a lil girl's dream come true - shipped quickly - packaging durable - arrived as stated it would... hours of pleasure for our 4 yr old.... affordability a plus - sturdy <end>  Fairy Tale Jewelry Box  I got this jewelry box for my Grand daughter. She loves it. She really likes watching the Fairy dance around and the music and that she can put her jewelry in it. <end>  good jewelry box  this is the perfect jewerly box for any young lady the style and durabilty is has a way of its own and it has alot more space than i though hands down would buy this again <end>  Three-year-old loved it!  I purchased this jewelry box for our three-year-old granddaughter. She was delighted with the twirling fairy and loved winding it up and playing the music. It will be perfect for her to keep her small treasures inside. It is attractive and well made for the price. This ended up being a good choice for her. I did not recognize the melody that was being played but I'm sure she didn't care. <end>  Broken  I ordered this jewelry box for two neices, one is working great and the other never did. So frustrating, I will try sending it back but it doesn't help the christmas morning disapointment. <end>  Cheap but good gift  I got this along withBUTTERFLY Necklace Charm Pendant w/ Crystal Wings in Butterfly Velour Gift Box-Colors may varyas a gift for my 5 year old flower girl. It's just a plastic box with some paper coating, but she loved it and that's what counts. I recommend it for gifting, but with the expectation of it not lasting too long. <end>  A Great Little Jewlery Box  My 6 year old niece has been fascinated by "music boxes" since she was 3. She has gotten one on her birthday and for Christmas for the last several years. This fairy box was perfect for her. The fairy dancer and outside of the box are beautiful. A great buy. <end>  Fairy Tale Jewelry Box  this fairy tale jewelry box is perfect for a little ballerina's first jewelry box, especially if you love fairies! Can't wait 'til Christmas to give them to my granddaughters. <end>  Pretty  My daughter will love this for Christmas. It's a traditional little girl's music box. It is much larger than I thought it would be though. <end>  Great buy!  I just purchased four of these as a gift for four of my neice's first communion this weekend. Each one was $10! I received them by FedEx today and it is just perfect. I wish I would have purchased a few more for last minute gifts. It doesn't look cheap. It looks pretty durable to me. Yet I'm sure my 10, 11, and 12 year old nieces are old enough not to bang this around. I love the music that plays when you wind it up and open the box to see the fairy dancing. I sort of wish it was a ballerina dancing instead. Still, very cute for a great price!!! I am very happy. =) <end>  pretty little jewelry box  This was a first jewelry box for a little girl's birthday. She loves the dancing fairy. It was perfect for what i was looking for. <end>
 B000H6Z070  14K Rose Gold Pave Diamond Ring ||	  Ring of my life!  This ring is much better looking once you get it! I was so happy to see it sparkle in the light. I'm very satisfied with the ring. <end>
 B000H7BC44  Art glass necklace, 'Passionate' 23.6" L ||	  Over priced  Not a great value for the money. Product seems a bit cheap looking in person. <end>
 B000HAPCQ0  14k Gold 1/3 Carat Round Cut Solitaire Diamond Ring - (I-J;I1-2) ||	  Beautiful Ring  I just received this ring today. It was delivered several weeks earlier than expected which was great. The ring comes in a beautifully finished wooden box and comes with an appraisal summary from Independent Gemological Laboratories. The ring itself is absolutely beautiful. It is beautifully finished, the white gold accents hold a very nice size diamond. The ring is round (I bought a ring from a competitor and it was horrible). I'm so excited to give this ring to my hopeful fiance, it will look very nice on her finger! Keeping my fingers crossed.If you buy from Netaya you will be extremely happy with the quality of the ring. <end>  Beautiful Engagement Ring!!!  It's a nice quality piece of jewel!!! Very well finish!!! Nice design! My wife just loved it! <end>
 B000HAPHME  14k White Gold 1/3 Carat Round Cut Cathedral Solitaire Diamond Ring (I-J ; I1-2) ||	  she liked it  the ring is beautiful my girl like it and wears it everyday, my only problem was it took quite a long time to be delivered, but it was worth the wait order in advance if you have a special occasion planned <end>
 B000HAU1AW  Natural White 9.5-10mm Journey Diamond Bail 14k Gold Cultured Pearl Drop Pendant Necklace 18" - Dahlia Classic Collection ||	  Beautiful, Great Quality and well worth the money  I was not very sure when I bought this as the picture was not very attractive. I decided to take a risk as the seller has 99% positive feedback. And I can't be happier for my decision! The diamond quality is good as described. Most impressively is the pearl--large, very shine, clean- I would say even better than the one I got from Mikimoto. I am sure that I will buy the matching earrings soon. <end>
 B000HAUP44  Sterling Silver Italian Diamond Cut Very Thin Twisted Serpentine Chain 1.1mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Beautiful chain  This chain was exactly what I was looking for! It is delicate, sparkly, and added to the beauty of my pendant. Excellent purchase. Great service. Received my product 3 days before the anticipated delivery date. <end>  Cheap material.  I bought this necklace twice, once in 16" and once in 18". The first time it broke by getting caught in her hair in the shower. The hair tied into the lock and it pulled apart and snapped. The second time she was laying with it on and noticed that the pendant was lower then usual. Upon examination the chain itself had broke. Nothing pliers can't temporarily fix but I will not be buying from here again. <end>  cheap silver tarnishes quickly  I loved the chain initially,especially for the price. Shortly after the chain started looking brownish-yellow loosing all shine. I placed it in jewlery cleaner, to no avail. you can not tell if the chain is real silver. <end>  Couldn't be happier  Everyone is so right when they say that the chains are incredibly sparkly. The way they are cut make the silver really catch the light well and just look stunning. It adds a little something to every pendant you may want to wear it with. I've bought from this company 3 times so far and each time I couldn't be more satisfied. The chains are very sturdy. I never take my necklace off- sleep in it, shower in it, etc. and it is still beautiful. <end>  Love it  Sturdy, reliable replacement chain. Prettier in real life. I typically use it to wear larger pendants, or swap it in if the chain that comes with the jewelry is too short for my tastes. <end>  AWSOME!!!!  Not only is the chain beautiful but the company is AWSOME!!!! I had a problem with my USPS, they lost my package. Well Sabrina Silver helped me and I recieved a replacement 3 days later!!!! I will be ordering from them from now on!!!! <end>  Very weak chain  I bought 2 chains based on a reviewer that wrote how strong the chain was. This chain is pretty but it is not strong in fact it is very weak. The first chain broke taking it out of the plastic pouch got caught in the zip lock.I'll stick to buying chains I can hold and check in person, I don't blame the seller I think it is listed properly as a very thin chain. <end>  broke right away  I ordered four and they were all nice looking but the littlest one as soon as I tried the clasp the clasp broke. The ones that did not break are really great. <end>  Cheap because it's cheap!  Started tarnishing the day I opened it. I've had it for three months and it looks like an old, ugly, gold chain; when it started out as a sparkly, shiny, silver chain! Don't get it unless you're prepared with Silver Jewelry cleaner on hand. <end>  A beautiful necklace 4 cheap  I was kinda skeptical about this "cheap" chain, I figured that it would arrive looking like something out of a 25 cent machine. Boy, was I wrong. Every review has been dead on, it's georgous, dosen't kink, and looks like it costed a lot more. I've worn it everyday, and gotten tons of compliments on it. best of all, it came 4 days sooner than expected. I ordered the 22" chain, and it's perfect. don't pass this up! it's worth a lot more than it costs! <end>  VERY Pretty, very delicate, but a little shorter than I expected.  I was a little nervous when I order this, Thinking "how good can it be for 7 bucks. WELL, they are VERY Pretty, very delicate, but a little shorter than I expected. I ordered this chain for a small charm that I love, but that chain had broken. It looks so nice with this one. I also got the anklet, but it is the perfect necklace for my 1 year old daughter. She ALLWAYS wants everything I have, so this was a nice little chain for her. I am very happy. + you really can't beat the price. (as an added bonus, it arrived in less that a week) <end>  Beautiful  This is a really nice chain. For the price I paided I expected something very cheap, but I was very wrong. It shined in the light and it's just a beautiful chain. This is a perfect buy if your looking for a 925 chain, but not looking to pay a lot of money. <end>  Better than I expected!  I love this chain! It is delicate, but strong (my 10 month old son yanks on it constantly, and it stands up well to the abuse). It is a beautiful chain and I love the shine. It works perfectly for the small pendant for which I bought it. I agree with some of the other comments that it seems a little shorter than advertised (no, I haven't actually measured it) so I ordered one size larger (22" versus 20") than I wanted and it is perfect. I'm really happy with this purchase!!! <end>  Got it as a replacement.  I gave my silver chain to my sister for her &#34;Mom&#34; pendant, and my second one broke. I'm an interchangable-pendant kind of person, and this chain holds the weight of even my heavier pendants very well. <end>  Beautiful!  I love the design of this necklace soo much i now have 3 of them and they are beautiful! They shimmer in the light more than any other design i have seen, very very beautiful! <end>  OUCH! warning about hair  I ordered three of these necklaces, 20", 24" & 30", on a Tuesday and received them on Friday. All 3 of them came in one gift box. Very fast with the delivery.These chains are very sparkly, very thin & delicate looking.I bought these three chains for my adult daughter, the three lengths looked great on her. My daughter has, thick, long hair about to the middle of her back.. which will be relevant for this post.She opened the box, loved them, and put them on right away... the 30" chain was long enough for her not to have to open the clasp.. she just slipped it over her head.. the other two chains she needed to open the clasp and put around her neck.All three of them, together, looked very pretty.After 10 mins of wearing them she said something about the chains pulling her hair.After 25 mins she had me help her get the chains off her neck because she said it was painful.. the chains were tangled in her hair and pulling strands out. It did take awhile for me to maneuver the chains, to pull the least amount of hairs out, to get them off.After I removed the chains I thought.. well I just paid for these three chains for only 25 mins of wear because she'll never put them on again. But then I suggested that maybe if she wears her hair in a pony tail or up in a clip this might not happen. I know she wont get to wear them as much as I would have thought she would, now that her hair has to be up in order to wear them, but it's better then her putting the chains away and never wearing them again. <end>  Love it!  I bought this for a chain that broke. It is a bit shiny like stated but I absolutley love it. It is very sturdy. I wear it everyday, shower with it and have had zero problems. It is dainty and I think very pretty. Thanks! <end>  seems good  I just got the anklet a few minutes ago but it seems good. It looks like thicker of a chain than I expected. I guess its a question of how long it will last. But it seems well worth it for $5 even  -) <end>  Not quite as described  I purchased this necklace to replace a silver necklace. I choose this because I wanted something similar to the one I broke as it had twisted look as well. This necklace is very nice its very bright and shinny silver. However it is not quite as it was described. The description says its 'very thin' which it is not. I know there is a measurement stated on how wide it is which to me seems quick small, but I didn't get out a ruler to check. I figured it said 'very thin' it would be 'very thin', but it is much thicker then almost all the other necklaces I own. Don't get me wrong it is still a very pretty necklace, I just was expecting it to be 'very thin'. I'm hoping since it's thicker it will be harder to break then the last I had. So if the width is a concern for your I would suggest you get out a ruler and check to make sure you know what it really is. <end>  Great Price  I like to layer pendents on different length chains. These chains are very attractive, and well made. They are well worth the price. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful Silver Chain  This chain is beautiful. I have a contemporary sea-glass and silver pendant that I hung on it and I get many compliments on the chain and pendant as a whole. It is really lovely. <end>  100% Beautiful  I am 100% satisfied with my chain. I wear it almost daily. It is gorgeous. The twist and shimmer make it catch light. I would recommend this chain to anyone on here, for the price it is beautiful, you wont be disappointed. <end>  Just what I was looking for.  Elegant, reasonably priced, a clasp that isn't a pain to open, and it doesn't snag my hair. Great. <end>  Sterling Surprise  Sterling Silver Very Thin Twisted Serpentine ChainThis is a very pretty silver chain, good to wear with just about anything. Because it is twisted, it sparkles and glimmers alot. <end>  A very nice necklace for the price!  I am still wearing it after a month. This necklace is stronger than it looks..A very good value for the price! <end>  silver chain  Sterling Silver Very Thin Twisted Serpentine ChainI am very pleased with this product. It is very thin but also strong so that I don't worry about it not being able to keep my locket safe. It is also quite lovely. I would definitely buy from this vendor again. <end>  Delicate and Pretty  I've had this chain for almost 4 years. It's shines beautifully The twisted serpentine is very attractive. This is a delicate chain. It's approximately .5mm, so it's very thin. This is a nice chain to use, if you don't want to distract from your pendant. It also looks nice alone when wanting just a whisper of jewelry around your neck. It twinkles.I found this chain to be strong. Recently my chain broke and I'm ordering another. I don't fault the workmanship for the breakage. It's very thin as stated in product description and I wasn't careful when cleaning with my polishing cloth. I pulled too hard and snapped the chain.(No more cleaning my delicate chains when I'm nervous or pissed off)This chain link is stronger than most herringbone chains of 1mm and less, and I find it much more attractive the the basic box link. My chain never developed a lot of tarnish and it cleans to sparkling without a lot of effort....just be gentle when cleaning. Personally, I don't use liquid silver cleaner, but you could probably get good cleaning results by tossing it in the liquid for a few seconds.This chain doesn't scream silver. I've worn this chain with both silver and white gold pendants. It blends great with either metal. The first time I wore it, the chain felt a little rough around my neck, but that feeling soon left. I know I have enjoyed this chain. With the price of gold soaring, I'm glad to get such a nice chain at a great price, which by the way hasn't increased since my orignal purchase. Gem Avenue has a large variety of really good quality silver chains. <end>  Very Pretty Chain & Great Length!  "Great seller! Item arrived very fast. Chain is perfect length (I purchased the 24") and very pretty, sparkly! Looks fab with my Irish charm. Thank You Sabrina Silver." <end>  Very pretty chain.  I bought this for a friend and she absolutely loved it. I got it the day after i ordered it, but it was shipped from like 3 hours away..  p I loved how fast i recieved it, especially since i paid standard shipping. The chain seemed a little shorter than what i thought, but it fit my friend perfectly. It's one of those chains, that when it's bent, it gets kinda stuck that way... and you need to be kind of gentle because it's very delicate. It's a perfect buy, especially for the price! I definately recommend this item... it's very shiny and stands out. <end>  BEAUTIFUL CHAIN NECKLACE  THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE.IT'S SPARKLY.IT'S LIGHT.IT DOESN'T KINK AT ALL.IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE.I ORDERED 2 OF THESE CHAINS.A 16 AND AN 18 INCH TO WEAR ONE INSIDE THE OTHER.THEY LOOK SO GOOD TOGETHER LIKE THAT.THIS IS THE BEST JEWELERY.THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT AROUND HERE WHERE I LIVE.I'LL DEFINITELY BUY MORE JEWELERY FROM HERE. <end>  Very delicate, and pretty chain.  I bought this in the eighteen inch, which seems just a bit shorter than other chains labeled as such. However, this is a very sharp looking chain. It's very white silver, and it sparkles a lot. It looks like a spider web with dew on it, or twinkle lights when on the neck.I bought this for a small pendant that I'd lost the chain to, but I honestly think that with the sparkle and interest it has visually that it would be more suited as a chain that's worn all on its own. <end>  Much more attractive than in the picture  A nice moderately priced chain that is very pretty. It is fine, delicate chain and the serpentine pattern has a spiral look to it. The are reflective areas that shimmer every 1/4 inch or so. I am using with a large cubic zirconia pendant and it is quite stunning. The chain feels strong and less likely to tangle. Great purchase for the price. <end>  Sterling Silver Chain  Very delicate, very pretty chain. It doesn't kink up when I wear it, and it's the perfect length. I have worn this every day since I received it. <end>  Good to buy!  This chain was exactly what I was looking for! It is so cheap but really good quality! I am really happy with this product! <end>  WOW!  I was looking for a cheap but nice chain. This is perfect. Arrived in two days. Beautiful chain nice, strong and polished. Great buy for five dollars or a little more. <end>  Oh, Shiny!  Just got this today, and it's just SO pretty I had write about it. I had a very delicate little pendant and I didn't want the chain to take away from it. I doesn't. While it's sparkling and beautiful, it compliments my pendant nicely. A necklace I've been wearing for weeks got noticed TODAY by people because of it. I ordered the 16", and it's true to size. <end>  Nice chain  This is a very nice chain and just what I was looking for. It seems stronger than it's delicate appearance suggests. I use it alone or with different pendants which I had. It works nicely in both applications. Good service and prompt delivery. <end>  Very Attractive!  I purchased the 16" length chain for a pendant that I received as a gift. As everyone else has said it's very delicate looking, and it actually does sparkle in the light. It's very pretty. I'm considering wearing it without the pendant, and buying another chain for the pendant! By the way, shipping was excellent. <end>  very good to buy!  this sparkling little chain is great to buy. the length of the chain is just right for other sparkling little pendants. I bought my sister a necklace with a star-shaped sparkling pendant. the chain doesn't really go with it. So i bought this twisted 20'' chain, it fits perfectly. people praise it a lot. it makes the pendant looks much better.we were worried that this kind of twisted chain would be easy to break. but in fact, it holds very well. good quality! <end>  Exquisite little chain  If you are looking a simply gorgeous little silver chain, you've found it. It is beautiful and more substantial than I expected for the low price. <end>  Very nice for the price  The color is vibrant. It hasn't dulled yet.Looking at the chain i could not find any imperfections.It is very small and very light, hardly noticeable on the skin...just what i wanted.Exactly what I wanted. <end>
 B000HAWTDE  Sterling Silver Pandora Type Barrel Bead Charm w/ Blue Synthetic Opal Inlay & CZ stones, 3/8" (9mm) ||	  Gorgeous!  This is a beautiful bead! High quality! It is more beautiful in person than on the site. I've received a ton of compliments on it. I've worn it on my charm bracelet as well as a 16 inch snake chain, and it is beautiful either way!! <end>  Blue Opal  I purchased this item back in June 2010 and as time went on the stones started fall out and i loved this charm/bead. It is more beautiful in person. It had been several months and this charm was no longer looking pretty because most of the stones had fallen out. I contacted the seller "Sabrina Silver" and I got an immediate reply...they just asked me to take a picture of the item and I did and they requested me to send it back and sent me another (which arrived very quickly). Because I loved this so much and think it's so beautiful regardless of the missing stones I will give it 5***** because of the beauty of the bead and the response to replace it so promptly. You won't go wrong ordering this bead or purchasing from this seller A+ <end>  Wow!  This bead is beautiful! It stands out on a Pandora bracelet or as a solitary bead on a silver necklace. I am very glad I own it. <end>  B E A U T I F U L  This is my favorite on my bracket, it looks so much better in person. Now I want the pink and white one as well. <end>  My Favorite!  This bead is beautiful! It is the showpiece on my Pandora bracelet. Everyone comments about how pretty and unique it is. <end>  Birthday gift for sister  As many of the other reviewers noted, this item is much prettier in person than on the page. My sister was delighted with it, and said it really gave her Pandora bracelet a needed shot of color. Don't think you can go wrong with this item for the "jewelry nut" in your life! <end>  Beautiful opal bead  This is a beautiful blue inlaid opal bead. It is bigger than the average bead. It is so pretty that it and the others similar to it garner compliments all the time. Sabrina Silver makes several others in different colors that go with it/or complement it.Sterling Silver, Pink Lab Opal Inlay Pandora Type Barrel Bead Pendant w/ CZ stones, 3/8" (9mm) <end>  Absolutely gorgeous!  I came back from Mexico with a blue Australian Opal (genuine) bracelet. I'm so in love with it that I wanted more..... I bought this bead to go on my Brighton necklace chain. It is gorgeous! You cannot tell the difference between this synthetic opal and the genuine opal bracelet. Absolutely love it! <end>  Fab!  Worth every dollar. Finding charms to fit pandora is tough so this was a good buy.Plus this is beautiful and timeless. Looks better in person. <end>  Gorgeous bead  I received this bead as a christmas gift and just love it. The picture doesn't do it justice. I have received numerous compliments when I wear it. I plan on ordering two more of the same to wear on my chamilia earrings. <end>
 B000HBMMUI  Sterling Silver Cat Face Ring 7/16 inch wide, size 9.5 ||	  Very Fun Ring  This ring is as cute as it looks in the picture. As a new cat owner, I enjoy having this to wear as a subtle reminder that I own cats. It is a little less quality than I thought it would be -- the ring is thin, but for the price, it's great. <end>  Great ring for cat lovers  I bought this ring for my daughter (10) and it's great. The cat face looks very cat-like without being cutesy. The quality of the ring is very nice as well. <end>  WOW and meow.  My niece is happy wearing this ring.It's more beautiful than in the photo.It's solid and unique. <end>  Cute ring  This ring is really cute. It isn't very bold, but more of a subtle look. It fits true to size. I really enjoy wearing it. <end>  cute lil cat ring  They changed the size of my ring before they shipped and it was perfect. My daughter loves her cat ring. <end>  Meow!  I love this ring I bought it for my self and wear it everyday. Any cat lover would love this. <end>
 B000HBOBPW  Sterling Silver Spider Web Ring 5/8 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  PERFECT HALLOWEEN GIFT!  I bought this ring for my daughter for Halloween. I always try to find someting that she can enjoy year round. She loved it, it was pefect in looks and very weighty. I hit this year's gift out of the park. It was a perfect Halloween gift! <end>
 B000HBOCJM  Sterling Silver Skull Ring 3/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Sterling Silver Skull Ring Size 7  I'm a huge skull fan. This ring is dainty and just perfect for the person with small and slender fingers. It's not gaudy or bulky but just perfect. Great quality. <end>  a little disappointed  Shipping was very quick. It's a cute little ring. However, the ring is not as pictured. There is no antique finish to highlight details. <end>
 B000HBV2SQ  Sterling Silver Teeny Endless Hoop Earrings for cartilage, Nose and lips, 5/16 inch round ||	  Petite, but great for kids  My daughter doesn't stop playing with her normal stud earings and often twists them on their retainer bar making them difficult to remove. We got these for her and while they are basic in design, and small in size!! they are perfect for her small ears and no more stuck earings... <end>  Just what I was looking for  These earrings are just what I was looking for, but couldn't find in any local store. They are very small, so be certain they will fit ahead of time by measuring precisely. The only problem I had was actually fastening them in my ears. Once fastened, however, they will stay clasped together. It took me about a 1/2 hour to get them fastened! Would recommend however... <end>  Where have you been all my life?  I have searched the world for a truly tiny hoop and this is it. I wear it in my tragus and it is perfect. I was even able to easily hook it, which if you have a tragus piercing, you know it can be difficult to insert and hook earrings. I have spent big bucks on other 'tiny' hoops and none were as fab as these! I'm going to reorder because I know I will lose them over time since I'm wearing it all the time. Great price, too. <end>  when they say tiny, they mean TINY  These little hoops are very cute and well made and TINY! They do give a measurement so you are fairly warned. If you have large earlobes, you may not be able to wear them there (maybe if you have cartilage pierced) so they offer lots of different sizes on their website. But overall they are well made. <end>  Teeny silver hoop earrings  I have multiple piercings in both ears and was tired of studs. I put one of these on one of the piercings going up my ear. It took awhile to get it in but I know that it will not fall out or get hooked on anything. <end>  Perfect for small earlobes!  I just got two pair of these in the mail today, and I absolutely LOVE them! I have small, attached earlobes and have never been able to find the tiny hoops I wanted until now! They are so cute, they don't irritate my sensitive skin, and they are too small for my baby to grab and yank! Now I just need 5 more pairs.I had no problem fastening them - I just inserted them so the post entered the back of my earlobe and came out the front, then used a pair of hemostats to hold the post still so I could put it into the tube.These are definitely better quality than the buck-apiece ones you get at the mall... I'll update my review after I've had them in for a few weeks, to see how they hold up after non-stop wearing to sleep, shower, etc. <end>  Cute but Small  This earring is surprisingly TINY. In the picture they look a lot bigger. They are really meant for a new born or a barbie doll. But they look very nice as a tragus ring though. The claps is kinda difficult to connect but still a good product <end>  Very pretty but too small for my little ears!  Very pretty/shiny earrings but way too small for my ears and my ears are pretty small. These earrings are for a child plain and simple, easy to put in if these things fit your ears, everyone who had trouble putting these on barely made the cut! Would be easy to put on a child since they are sized for one. Other than not fitting, I love them!! Would wear them everyday if they fit me, I'm giving them to a friends 5 yr old daughter  ) <end>  Super small and great!  I was hunting for super small earrings three years ago and found these, and they are perfect! I wanted it to hug my ear and it does just that, but not tight at all. I wear them in my second lobe piercing. I've left them in my ear for the past three years and just bought a replacement cause they got black, but totally understood. Occasionally I have some trouble putting them in, but then they stay on well, only one came off once. And putting the new pair in today was really easy.Just a note, I do have really small ears, so if you have big ears, go for a slightly larger size. <end>  hoop earrings for my daughters  My daughters wanted small hoops for their ears for christmas. They have multiple piercings. They are easy to put in and they stay in. They love them. <end>  Great buy, great price  This was shipped out and received very quickly even though I picked the cheapest shipping (about a week.) Came in a nice small silver colored box with a small zip lock bag that had the earrings in it. Unfortunately they are too small for my ears, but that was my error in ordering the wrong size. Nice color silver and shiny too, and a good weight for how small they are. They are pretty hard to open and secure into the ear, but that is what I was looking for. I wanted something that required little to no maintenance since I do not change out that earring ever often. If you are looking a nice, simple earring that you don't plan on changing a lot this is a great buy. <end>  Great product. Practice first!  These are the perfect size for those who want earrings that hug the ear; they sit very close to the skin, so if this isn't the look you want, you may be happier with a larger diameter hoop. In response to those who complain that they are difficult to close, I recommend opening and closing them several times before putting them in the ear. Stretch them out (gently!) until they close with just a little pressure and they will be on in a snap. <end>  perfect  these teeny little earrings are exactly what I was looking for. They're small, comfy, and with a little practice, not too hard to put in. I would not recommend them for anyone who changes their earrings quite frequently, as they do take more time than regular earrings, but I was looking for something that I could just leave in. they hug the earlobe but are not at all tight or uncomfortable. (they might be if your earlobes are a little bigger). overall, perfect for what I was looking for. <end>  Tiny but GREAT  These tiny earrings are perfect for my cartilage piercing. I was unable to find anything like them in the store, and I love them! They do take some time to get in, but if you keep them in most of the time, they're fine  )The biggest plus side to these earrings, in my opinion, is that unlike "endless" hoops I've had in the past, these have a hinge which make them much easier to open and close. The hoops I had before did not have anything like that. They were impossible to get in and ended up bent and with a sore ear. THESE ARE MUCH BETTER! <end>  The smallest hoop you can hope to get around your lobe!  This was precisely what I was looking for- unobtrusive & doesn't call too much attention to itself. Also, the low price is worth it-don't be fooled it's a quality piece of merchandise. My opinion  buy it, wear it & enjoy! <end>  tiny  This product is too small, maybe it is nice for a young kid but not for and older person to tiny. <end>  allways quality with sabrina silver  Just like every other item I have got from Sabrina Silver this is a quality, value for money item. These hoops are tiny so please double check the size befor you purchase. <end>  dont do it!!  so small a child couldnt even wear these. unable to open the clasp they were so small. Dont do it!! <end>  don't buy!  PLEASE don't buy these earrings, thought they are the perfect size for stacking them all the way up your ears they are junk, they break as soon as you get them or they wont close right. very pretty but not even worth $2.00!! <end>
 B000HBV2TA  Sterling Silver Small Bali Style Endless Hoop Earrings for Cartilage, Nose and lips, 3/8 inch round ||	  Tiny and cute  These earrings are very tiny and very cute, the enlarged picture does not do them any justice, in reality the silver is much brighter. Very comfortable fit, I bought these for use in a helix piercing (upper ear cartilage) because these are so tiny I would not recommend them for normal ear lobe piercings as the post is on the shorter side. <end>  Lovely  These earrings are much more brilliant than what is shown in the picture. They're quite small as well, about as big as the diameter of an eraser head. My earlobes are pierced twice, so these are perfect little accent earrings to wear in my second piercing. They're wonderful and worth every penny. The shipping was also extremely fast. <end>  perfect for multiple piercings  These earrings are the perfect size for multi pierced ears. I use them for my cartilage piercings on the top of my ear. They are very pretty...once you get them on. Any earring this size will be difficult to get on. These are not earrings that you will be changing frequently. However, if you're looking for small earrings that are a little more interesting than just plain hoops, these are for you. I just wish they had them in silver with gold. It would be better to wear with both my silver and gold jewelry. <end>  Sis Loves it!  I bought this for my sister , as she had wanted a replacement for her ear cartilage piercing. She really likes it and said she put it on immediately. Unfortunately, I did not get to see it personally, being we are a State apart but, she likes it and I take her word on it! Just what she wanted! <end>  Small and Cute  The earring was very small but that is what I was looking for. I use it in my cartilage piercing and I don't like the big earrings in there because they are not comfortable. I have been wearing it for a little over a week without any problems. Also its a pair and I didn't realize that when ordering it so I'm happy because I have a backup one if this one falls out. <end>
 B000HCLGQ8  Sterling Silver Diamond Circle Earrings ||	  not so great.....  these are definitely tiny and not substantial at all. I didnt feel they were worth the money, <end>
 B000HCLNTI  Sterling Silver Flower Necklace With Amethyst by Zina, 17" ||	  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT  I got this as a gift for my daughter. First, it came in a cheap cardboard box and bag, not the promised packaging on the website. Second, the links between the flowers are so small that the necklace kinked and was hard to straighten- it would be a nightmare every time you tried to put it on. Finally, the lobster claw clasp is so tiny that it's almost impossible to open. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by- I'm surprised that Amazon, whose products I order routinely, would carry such an item, and thankful for their return policy since I returned it after seeing it within five minutes of the package delivery to my house. <end>  Pretty, but just looked cheap  I agree with the previous reviewer that it was a little hard to get unkinked and came in a tight bag that I was aghast to see such a big necklace stuffed into. However, my main problem with the necklace, that while pretty, looked like something you'd buy for $5 at Claire's and not an expensive Zina necklace. If you need a gift for a young girl it would be pretty, but it's way too expensive for what it is (even at the $99 I paid). <end>
 B000HCNAM6  Sterling Silver Filigree Amethyst Earrings ||	  Buy the set  I bought this and the matching necklace as a gift for my mother in law and she loved them. The pictures do not do justice, the filigree has so much more depth and sparkle than you can see in the pictures. They are alot bigger than I thought they would be and so stunning. <end>  amethist earrings  These are beatuiful, but they are a little larger than I expected them to be so they hang down from my lobes. <end>
 B000HCNH4M  Sterling Silver Leaf Stations Necklace With Double Chain by Zina, 17" ||	  Absolutely beautiful  This necklace is weighty and looks beautiful on. The length makes it very versatile and can be worn with many different necklines. I love the clasp - it is hidden when closed. I watched this item for months and when it finally became available at a discounted price ( I paid $185.00) I jumped at the chance. The full price of $300 seems a bit high, though not unreasonable considering the weight and craftsmanship of the necklace. <end>
 B000HCSFYY  Zina Sterling Silver Men's Stratus Bracelet With Leather Strap Silver ||	  NOT LEATHER!!!  After wearing this "leather" bracelet for a solid month, I found that this item was not real leather, but a pleather like material.The material that was supposed to be leather wore off and revealed a white backing material. After spending $150.00 on this item, I was very disappointed. If you are considering purchasing this item, be warned!!! <end>  Very Satisfied.  This is a very nice, good looking, and durable product. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice bracelet. I've owned mine for about a month or two and I have had no problems. <end>  great Xmas gift  Very attractive, well priced, orderd for my 36 year old son and he wears it every day. <end>  QUALITY QUALITY QUALITY!!  This is my husbands Valentine's Day gift & I am proud to give it. I am a Jewelry person. I notice quality of workmanship, design, materials quality. Zina will be a vendor I go to again.My sincere thanks for a truely beautiful gift. <end>  Gift was great  Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and he was delighted with it. It arrived promptly and was good quality. <end>  Very good quality  An excellent bracelet with an exceptionally good lobster clasp. No flimsy jump rings to hold it together~just good solid silver. But alas, slightly too large for my wrist. Wish they made an 8 inch version. <end>
 B000HD07QM  6mm wide Hematite Band Gemstone Ring Size 4 to 12 ||	  Satisfied  The ring was shipped fast. Very good service,however the ring shown in the picture does not match the ring I received. It is not black but rather gray and a different texture. <end>  Worth It  This ring looks great. It was a little uncomfortable the first day but after that it smoothed out and felt fine. The color is awesome, very unique and stands out without being too flashy, just my style and a great buy. <end>  Loved the ring!!  My fiance loved his ring, it fit great, was shipped quickly and packaged great! Very nice would buy from again!!! <end>  Very Fragile  This ring is pretty cool looking, but the problem is that it is fragile. I dropped it in the bathroom after I washed my hands, and it broke into five diffrent pieces. If you insisst on buying this ring I would suggest that you take extra care of it, and be very careful. <end>  Wonderful Ring  I ordered this ring to replace one my fiance bought for me that broke. It is perfect. We both love it! <end>  Truly unique  I've bought other rings from Gem Avenue, this is one of my favorites.Quality for an excellent price!. <end>  Great ring  I'm pleased with what I got and have bought from them after buying this ring. It fit real good and when I compared it to a size chart it was right on. <end>  Good Health and Well Being  This ring was purchased for its known properties of magnetizing good health and was given to someone special. The s/h and delivery was super. <end>  hematite ring  The ring has a good, comfortable fit. The color does not fade and it compliments other jewlery. I like it a lot!! You should buy it. <end>  Love it, but easily broken.  It was exactly as described, and fit one of my fingers really well. It shipped fast, and I was really pleased at how gorgeous it was.I had previously purchased one except that it was thicker. I wore it for a while, about a few months or so, until it broke. I had slapped my hand down on the concrete, and it just crumbled to pieces. My boss remarked at how fragile hematite was, and I had never realized that. So, I suppose I shouldn't have purchased one in the first place. But I think they're really pretty.The quality, however, isn't all that great. I purchased this one (my second one), and it broke later that night, actually cutting my finger and I still have a very small shard imbeded into my skin.  \It's pretty, I like it, but it's SO fragile. <end>  Hematite ring  This ring didn't look like the picture does. It has more of a metallic blue color. The picture makes it look black, though. The ring seems to be solid and good quality, just don't expect it to look like the picture, it doesn't. <end>  what a great deal!!!  This is a great ring. Nice weight, true to size and really nice colouring. I was worried that it would be flimsy since it was so inexpensive, but it's not.Another plus is that the shipping was so fast! Win-Win-WIN!! <end>  nice looking accessory  i thought it was a very nice looking accessory ... can dress it up or down. it was just a smidge small on my size 7 wrist, but still a nice bracelet! <end>  I love it!  The ring is true to size and very thick and durable. I will note that as with any stone jewelry, be careful notto ever drop it on hard surfaces. The ring is beautiful and I am very happy with this purchase! <end>  Awesome  Awesome ring for such little money.Wanted ring for my thumb as I enjoy the magnetic properties of the hematite for aches in hand and this this was perfect.Presentation box was unexpected surprise. <end>  excellent  I bought the ring for my husband as an anniversary gift. He loves hematite because of its beauty and simplicity. We know and accept its fragility and just take extra steps to take care of it. Absolutely wonderful! <end>  Looks Nice, but didn't hold up...  The ring looks very nice, but the quality is not so nice. This was the second time I have purchased this ring for my husband. He is a man that talks with his hands, both times he was pointing to something on a table and voila, the ring broke into many pieces. Needless to say we are going to get a quality metal this time. If you are gentle with your hands, this ring may work. It is a nice looking ring, but you get what you pay for. <end>  Picture do not make justice to this amazing ring!  I ordered the ring for my girlfriend. When I saw the picture I was not that impressed. The item came in within 2 business days. I was amazed, but when my girlfriend open the beautiful small box that came in (Actually she still have the box. She loved the box too!) the ring was amazing! The shine was superb and the look is wonderful. She loves it and I was impressed in how the picture lacks the real looks of the ring. I highly recommend this ring and seller. I have ordered before from this seller and there has never been a problem. <end>  Gemstone Ring  This was a great ring and the price was right. The only thing that I can tell you we be careful with it. My job is more hand on and after four or five month one day the ring cracked. It broke into several piece. I was the ring or the companys fault but more tha my job is a little more physical then most so... for the normal guy it's a great ring and the price is right.... <end>  Looks much better in person!  I have been wearing this ring just for a week and hence a cautious 4 stars out of five.This is one ring that looks much better than in the product picture. It looks much more metallic and glossy than the picture suggests, but does not appear flashy. I have had no problems so far  the ring does not scratch or chafe and is not unduly heavy. It does not stain either. A steal, for just 5$.Though I'm wearing it everyday, I cannot comment on the durability or wear yet, but if it lasts a month, it'd still be a good buy. <end>  Still like mine after several weeks  Speedy delivery. I like my ring. Be aware that it runs a tad small...recommend ordering 1/2-size larger. <end>  Cool ring!  The ring is as advertised, although you won't know just how cool it looks (a shifting silver/grey/black) until you see one in person. If it was a little wider it would be perfect. <end>  Hematite is supposed to break that's what it does  Hematite is a natural stone that helps remove negative energy once the stone had reached it's peak of negative energy it WILL BREAK! If you know nothing about it don't buy it or review it Again this stone is supposed to break that's what it does! <end>  not so good  i got this for my husband after he lost his wedding band. at first it was really nice and he got a lot of compliments. about a month after getting it he was at practice for Honor Guard doing movements on a rifle. He tapped his hand against the rifle and the ring shattered.I also got myself one which i do still have, but do not wear. It hasn't broken because i don't work with my hands, but the appearance isn't very good anymore. It starts to get prints all over it that just won't come off. <end>  Awesome! Sharp!  When I bought this item, I had no doubt what to expect. It was exactly want I wanted, it fitted like it was made for me and I got it beep-beep fast! <end>  bad ring  i wore this ring only twice i dropped it and it broke into 3 pieces. <end>  Fantastic Ring  I absolutely love these rings. I'm allergic to most metals, so it's hard for me to find rings that I actually can wear. Though the hematite rings are very fragile, you just have to be extra careful if you're going to take it off and put it somewhere. It has a beautifully shiny metallic luster and looks fantastic. Great product! <end>  Fab!  I love this ring! It is a great weight and feels very smooth. It looks casual with jeans but looks classy with a little black dress. I recommend it. <end>  Great for allergies  Love this ring! It's a very nice, shiny black -- and a true black, unlike most rings sold on here -- ring that works great for anyone with allergies. I tend to have problems wearing most metal rings, but this one has been great so far. It's also fine to wash, and it won't change color. <end>  Hematite Genuine Gemstone 6 MM Band Ring Size 7.5  The ring was totally as described, shipped to us really fast, and with most excellent presentation. <end>  It's nice, it fits  I got this to keep my wedding band from sliding off when working with water and soap. It fits tightly and is durable. And it doesn't look tacky either. So it's a good solution! <end>  My hand no longer feels naked  I bought this because it was guaranteed to be slimmer than the hematite rings I was finding everywhere else, and it does its job well. It is not at all bulky, and is shaped in a manner that doesn't bother my other fingers. (I had a rounded one, and it was VERY annoying.) It's perfectly decent quality, as far as I can tell, just don't smack glass 9x13s with these sorts of rings on--that's how I broke my other one. Hematite is not meant to hold together indefinitely. Remove before cooking! <end>  Great buy!  The ring came quickly, and in a small box to store it. It looks amazing, and goes great with almost anything. However, it is fragile. <end>  It was awesome while it lasted  It broke on me, but i loved this ring and I didn't care that it broke because it did it's job! It lasted for like 4 months, and people loved it! I am going to buy another one eventually. This ring was too amazing, it broke because I was rough housing, but it did take a lot of damage before, so it is fragile but NOT fragile at the same time, there were many times i punched a wall and it didn't break. I recommend it <end>  great buy  got this for my b/f. he likes it thou it hits the webbing but thats not the rings fault its just how his hands are <end>  I love it!  I just love this ring, it's very comfortable and beautiful. I goes with any outfit, it's like a lil black dress for your fingers. <end>
 B000HD5A1Y  6mm wide Carnelian Band Gemstone Ring Size 5 to 11 ||	  Disappointed  The ring purchased looked alright but the material seems to be of inferior quality as one week later, the ring broke into several pieces. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.Sharon <end>  red agate ring  The ring and its color looks very nice but less durable than the other rings and products purchased from Gem Avenue. It broke into several pieces when my hand just routinely brushed against an strong surface. This however does not deter me from buying more items from this vendor. Their pricing is far better than local vendors with similar products and my shattered ring is unfortunate but no where near being some huge loss. My other purchases from Gem Avenue balance things out. <end>  carnelian ring  Items came early and were as advertized. I bought several of these rings and find them fun towear. <end>  Nice ring  Color was similar to that pictured on the sale site, maybe a little more toward orangy-red. Has held up well with the wearing. <end>  Its ok...  Both rings appear like they are depicted and are holding up rather well... I am enjoying my purchase and would recommend it to others... <end>  The "Red" Ring  This ring looks red, but it is not. It also looks like a solid color, again it is not. My ring in orange and transparent. I wanted this to match a red outfit, now I have a useless orange translucent ring. <end>  Gorgeous  I really like these rings. The ones of this color that I have bought are red, not orange, but they do vary a little (one I bought is darker than the other). It is holding up well, I wear them every day and it has not chipped or cracked. <end>  In Love  I am in love with this ring. It's a beautiful solid red ring with slight variation of other colors. It's it is also durable, I know I see a few reviews saying that when the ring fell it shattered. Mine has fallen from me a few times and I am glad to say it is still in one piece. If you're looking for a casual everyday ring this is it. <end>  carnelian ring is a winner!  http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HD5A3C/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis is a fabulous little ring. The color is true, with both red and some orange. It fits beautifully and looks great on the hand (I use it for my middle finger). I needed a carnelian ring to match a necklace and earrings I had just purchased as a gift; guess I will have to get another ring 'cause I am keeping this one! <end>  Red is always a nice touch  I love this ring as well as the others I have bought from them. It has markings inside it that came from the stone this was made from and I love wearing its a 6 and a little to big but I still wear it when I can. I adore this ring and its unique qualities. <end>  Gorgeous Red Ring!!  This ring is really gorgeous! I've always wanted a red thumb ring and this one is great to wear with almost any colored outfit. It just pops! <end>  Nice band rings  I purchased two carnelian 6MM band rings as ring guards for my diamond ring. They look nice on either side of the diamond and are quite noticeable. The color is a typical carnelian color of a rich, rusty red, and the rings seem durable enough to wear for dress or casual; however, I would not wear these to do manual labor, gardening, or something such as racket ball as they are a little delicate like the description says. I have had these bands for several weeks, and so far they have worn and held up well. <end>  I loved the rings. I love all the colors. The quality to me was well worth the price. I would always shop at Gems  I love the rings in all the colors. The ring is durable to me. I would always order from Gems. Great company. <end>  Love this ring!  I actually purchased two rings because I was so worried that the first would break after just a day or two. I have been wearing it non-stop. I even sleep and shower in it. I feel it is very sturdy and the thickness of the band gives me confidence that it won't shatter, no matter what I do. Perhaps the manufacturer has changed the width of the ring based on prior reviews but I would say that it's a sturdy band, and now I have one to wear and one to give as a gift! <end>  Satisfied  I am quite satisfied with this ring, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for carnelian jewelry, or any Leo looking for birthstone jewelry.l) <end>  Happy  I ordered the product and received just what I was expecting within three days. It is fragile but we're told that in the product description before ordering. So far I've had no problem with the ring. It's fine for everyday use just take it off it you're doing something that may cause it to rub or scrape too often. I'm happy with it. <end>  Love it!  I wear this ring in place of my engagement ring when the situation calls for a less ostentatios option. It's comfortable and I love it. <end>  genuine carnelian 6 mm band gemstone ring  PRODUCT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY NICE AND SAFE AND IT IS A VERY NICE RING. ITS HARD TO TELL WHEN A RING IS 6MM OR 5MM FOR I HAVE A FEW OF BOTH AND THEY ARN'T ALL THE SAME SIZE SO I'M NOT SURE WHICH WIDTH I LIKE THE BEST.JUST HOPE I DON'T BREAK IT. <end>  Carnelian band  This is another beautiful band from Gem Avenue. The color is Carnelian and is supposed to be orange/red. The color is beautiful and I love wearing it. <end>  This ring is not red!  Received this ring, unlike the picture shown here at amazon the ring was more of a rusty orange color and not at all like the deep red shown in this picture. Also the customer service from Gem Avenue is terrible! <end>
 B000HDCUBC  All-Natural Genuine 4 mm, Round Emerald earrings set in 14k White Gold ||	  Okay for the money  Ordered these after ordering a pair of similar sized from smile river. These had much better color, a darker green that is fairly well represented in the picture. The clarity was poor (I don't expect diamond like clarity), so they really didn't sparkle. I'm guessing these could have benefited from a treatment of some sort. As Emeralds are in huge demand now, getting a good quality stone is very expensive. I talked to a guy at Halzberg Diamonds, and a set of 1/4 ct AAA stones was $1500+. <end>
 B000HDGK68  All-Natural Genuine 8x6 mm, Oval Ruby earrings set in 14k Yellow gold ||	  It's poor quality  When we took this in to get it reset the jeweler showed us the huge cracks that had been covered over by a glass product or paste of some kind that melted off when they put it through routine cleaning (I trust the jewelers--they are BBB approved and have been in business for 18 years in the same location). It broke my heart that he spent so much money on something that was not what it was supposed to be. Do not buy this jewelry and be suspicious of this company. <end>
 B000HDKXE8  Sterling Silver Italian Puffed Anchor Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 2.4 mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Very nice and delicate  Bought this to put a small charm on for a friend bracket is much nicer in person seems sturdy and for the price it's perfect very pleased with my purchase <end>  Awesome!  I was very pleased with this bracelet. It is well made and fits well. I especially like the link it has. <end>
 B000HDKXFC  Sterling Silver Italian Puffed Anchor Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 3.4 mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Lovely chain, interesting design  I bought this along with several rolo chains, mainly out of curiousity for the style of the links. This is a slightly heavier chain at 1/8" so not the typical chain for a pendent, though it certainly would be nice with the right one. The links remind me of soda pop tops linked together. That's not to imply it's cheap looking, in fact it's very nice; just a bit different. It's a good style to wear alone, or with several chains of varying lengths together. Overall I liked it. The 4 stars are for personal taste only. I prefer the spiga and rolo chains a bit more. <end>  Lovely chain, interesting design  I bought this along with several rolo chains, mainly out of curiousity for the style of the links.

 B000HFCGYG  C'este Di Amore - 8 Carat Solitaire Pink CZ Ring, 5 ||	  Love my new ring!  I bought this ring and it came in earlier than I expected. It fits perfectly and is SO much prettier than in the picture. I love it! I'm also going to buy the clear stone one as well. <end>  Georgeous  I purchased the 8 carat pink cz solitaire for very little money. I received the ring well before the mailing deadline and when I opened the box I was truly astounded. The sparkle to this ring is amazing! I have several other rings and for the past 3 weeks have found myself wearing this one instead of others. Its durable and beautiful. I am so happy that I purchased this ring and will definitely be buying from this seller again and again!! <end>  ITEM NOT RECEIVED  THIS RING WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SHIPMENT.

 B000HG54GM  Sterling Silver Pink and Clear Crystal Bracelet Earrings with Necklace Jewelry Set Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Not What I Thought  I was excited when I saw this crystal combo but when it arrived in the mail I saw that it was NOTHING like it looked in the ad! My wife told me that it looked like something you give to a child! She said it looked like a toy! I was mortified! I wish I could send it back because my wife refuses to wear it! <end>
 B000HG77H6  Cubic-zirconia Rhodium Finish Sterling Silver Chandelier Earrings ||	  HORRIBLE  I was so excited to get these earrings for Christmas, my best friend purchased them for me off my wish list. I loved the way they looked in the picture and they didn't have size specifications but the picture looked as if they were at least 3/4" to an 1" in length. When I opened the package, I could not even find them they were so tiny. The entire earring is the length of my thumb nail -literally, and you cannot even see the stones! I don't know where this picture came from but it's magnified quite a bit. I do not write bad reviews and I am very fair on all my purchases but these were really horrible and I was extremely disappointed when I saw them. NOT worth the price or effort put forth to receive them. These will be returned and I will not purchase from this seller again! <end>
 B000HG9AWQ  Cubic-zirconia Rhodium Finish Sterling Silver Butterfly Earrings ||	  very good...  beautiful hoops, enchant. in the beginning veia to me like very great in the photo. and she was not sure that they were pretty. but really they are small delicate and elegant... them master... them use muchisimo because they are very convinables.. and really pretty... very very recommendable... <end>
 B000HGBN26  All-Natural Genuine 5x3 mm, Pear Shape Tanzanite pendant set in 14k White Gold ||	  Much Smaller Than It Appears  I received this item as a birthday gift after adding it to my wishlist. It is a beautiful pendant, but it's the tiniest piece of Tanzanite I have ever seen! It almost looks like it was meant as a child's necklace. You would be better off going to a jewelry store to purchase a similar item, so you can at least see the actual size. I have several other pieces of Tanzanite jewelry and based on what they cost, for the price of this item, you could easily find a much larger piece. <end>
 B000HGDQWG  All-Natural Genuine 7x5 mm, Pear Shape Ruby pendant set in 14k White Gold ||	  Beautiful  Great stone, as expected chain flimsy, had planned on replacing it before the purchase though. still cheaper than buying just the stone at a local retailer. <end>
 B000HGGGSW  14k Yellow Gold Children's Butterfly Earrings ||	  Not as "puffed" as I thought, but still very pretty/very nice!  Based on the picture, I thought these earrings might have a little bit more of a "puffed" effect, but they don't - and it's ok!  -) These are really sweet earrings. They are small ( 1/4 inch east-west and 1/8 inch north-south) but they feel very sturdy, and the screw-clasp is nice! They really show up and reflect the light very well. These would work for either a child/young person or an adult. Definitely recommend these earrings for all-around wear. <end>  Nice earrings for kids  These earrings didn't provoke any allergy to my niece, who presented allergy to other materials. They worked and looked pretty well. <end>
 B000HGHU3C  14k Yellow Gold Circle and Oval Chain Necklace, 36" ||	  Too Thin  Very light, thin gold. Mine arrived broken but Amazon makes it simple to return. I shop with them all the time. Not impressed with this necklace at all for the price. <end>
 B000HGIJUU  14k Yellow Gold Children's Ballet Slipper Earrings ||	  SMALL BUT VERY BEAUTIFUL  MY DAUGHTER IS A BALLERINA SO I THOUGHT SHE WOULD REALLY LIKE THESE, AND SHE DOES! BUT MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THEY ARE TINY! THEY SEEM TO BE FOR A TODDLER. OVERALL GREAT DETAIL AND QUALITY. <end>  great earrings  perfect size earring for three year old granddaughter. a little expensive for that age...but I am very satisfied with quality and look. <end>
 B000HGKLV0  14k Yellow Gold Children's Teddy Bear Earrings ||	  Pretty but...  These are pretty, but they came loose not on a card, also, the backs aren't the nice round screw on backs that are on the other kid earrings, they looked like reg earbacks, they do screw on, but they dont protect baby from pointed earring. <end>  very good service  Product was exactly what I expected, it was delivered in a prompt and timely manner. <end>
 B000HGKLWE  14k Yellow Gold Children's Heart Earrings ||	  Dented Earring  I was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for Christmas, however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented. Now I need to return them. Other than the dent, they were cute. Even though they were only $25.00, there should be some quality control by the manufacturer. <end>
 B000HGLXV2  14k Yellow Gold Twisted Mesh Rope Chain Necklace, 16" ||	  great price for the buy  back in the days when gold was affordable i will say yes this was a great buy but i don't think i would get it for this price now since i purchased this over 5 years ago, loved it so much i also got the bracelet <end>

 B000HJVCU6  Sterling Silver Round Bali BYZANTINE Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 4mm Antiqued Finish Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Bali Chain Review  The bracelet is of decent quality. The reason I purchased the bracelet was because I lost the original one purchased in Afghanistan. This new one was not of the same quality (welds are more obvious, links not as smooth, stiffer less fexible chain links), but will serve the purpose as a souviner/keepsake. Overall a 3 out of 5 for quality. Pertaining to service; it arrived very fast and in quality shipping material. A 5 of 5 for shipping. <end>  nice present!  it was all what I was looking for in a chain! I love it, nice quality to a good price. thanks! <end>  Super Bracelet  I bought this substantial sterling silver bracelet for my granddaughter who is eleven. It fits a small wrist so is very good for her size. The clasp, a beautiful rounded hook, can be squeezed to shrink the gap and help ensure the bracelet stays on. It is hard to find round rather than square byzantine chain. This bracelet is a rare find. <end>  Substantial without being bulky or chunky  I received this for Christmas in the 7 inch size and love it. It is a nice heavy weight and is thick enough to not be dainty but not overwhelmingly chunky. I have handmade silver pieces from China and Thailand but this is much better quality. The bracelet has no flaws and clasps securely. This is definitely a must-have for an everyday item. <end>  Bali chain review  The chain has very intricate detailing and the chain itself is HEAVY as well as heavy duty as far as chains go. Excellent attention to detail and great quality. Bought a chain and a prayer box for my Girlfriend. She absolutely loved it! An excellent choice - you will not be disappointed. <end>  beautiful  i bought this for my husband for his birthday. i love he ,loves it. SCORE!!! <end>
 B000HKHZ56  14K Yellow Gold Arrow Track Link Necklace 17" ||	  Good appearance and quality.  I like this chain. It looks like the picture. It might have been nice to be able to adjust the length a bit. <end>
 B000HKI4SI  Amazon.com  Dracua Medal 2in Necklace Halloween Costume Accessory  Clothing ||	  He loved it!  My grandson loved his medallion and it finished off his Dracula costume perfectly. He was very happy and so was his mother and I. <end>
 B000HKLX4A  Sterling Sil Bangle Bracelet w/Onyx 7" ||	  Could have found the same quality bracelet at a flea market a lot cheaper.  The bracelet looks cheap and netaya sent it in a bubble wrap envelope with no support, so it was warped and bent when it arrived. I used to think that amazon cared about the quality of the products they have on there web site, so i did'nt check netaya's feedback, i wish i would have. This company is a joke and i guess i can't trust amazon to market quality products either. <end>  Wonderful gift for anyone  I ordered three of these for my granddaughters. They were all thrilled with the bracelet and I think they are a very good value. <end>  Beautiful!  I ordered 4 of these as gifts for my daughters and regret not ordering 10 more for my office staff. It is a weighty yet beautifully feminine bracelet. Exquisite! <end>
 B000HKR7O0  Sterling Silver 10mm Emerald Cut Garnet Gemstone Ring Size 4.5 ||	  I love garnets!  Not only is this ring affordable, it has a garnet of very good size and quality in the center. I thought the color of the stone, for this remarkable price, was quite well saturated, a mark of quality. A recent convert to silver, the sterling silver band was so comfortable with it's wide backing, it would be easy to forget I was even wearing the ring! I would recommend it for everyday wear - no prongs jutting out that might hurt babies, etc. I have since ordered several more "gift" rings from this company. The red in garnets is a perfect Christmas color. The cute little boxes the rings arrive in are great for tucking into Christmas stockings. Think ahead! <end>  Beautiful ring  .925 Sterling Silver Band Garnet Gemstone RingI bought this ring for my daughter that just had a baby and liked it somuch I bought one for myself. Beautiful ring, great price. I'd reccomendit to everyone. Quick delivery also. <end>  excellent choice in price range  Ring is well balanced and good quality. The silver is shaped well and sized perfectly, and the scrolling looks just as beautiful as in the pictures. The garnet is really lovely at reflecting light, and is even in color. All in all, an really great ring for not too much money. <end>  I LOVE this ring!!!!!!!  I shopped around a bit when I decided to purchase a ring with a garnet stone. At the last minute I found this one on amazon. They even had my size, 6.5, which most sellers only do whole sizes. This ring is gorgeous and the band style with the square gem makes it VERY unique from most garnet rings out there. I have many oval/round shaped rings and this was so fun and different, and I loved the cut out art on the band. The ring came very quickly and wrapped in a beautiful little gift box. I am really pleased with this seller and am so glad I found this ring! <end>  Great quality for the price  I was looking for a birthstone ring for myself. I only wear silver, and tend to a more 'bohemian' style, so everything else I'd seen was either too fancy, too cheap looking, or plain ugly. This ring was exactly what I'd been looking for  refined but casual enough for everyday. The stone is large, well-cut, nice blood red. Can't go wrong with this one. <end>
 B000HKTRSO  Sterling Silver Bali BYZANTINE Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 7mm Very Heavy Antiqued Finish Nickel Free, sizes 8 - 30 inch ||	  great product and service  the bracelet is better than i thought it would be. the seller provided excellent customer service. i was contacted right away by an actual human on the phone when i emailed about upgrading my shipping because of an important deadline. i would buy from this seller again. <end>  $100+???  You can buy this type of bracelet in South East Asia that is made the same with silver. My dad bought me one I think possibly in Thailand. Save your $ buy on during your travels or check Ebay  P - BTW Ebay blows. <end>
 B000HKVDNQ  Sterling Silver Round Cut Citrine Gemstone 3mm Band Ring Size 4.5 ||	  Sterling Silver Band Citrine Gemstone Ring  I was very disappointed with this ring. The color of the stones were too yellow making the ring look like a child's prize from a dispenser. <end>  Very Sunny Ring  I bought this ring specifically for the rich yellow of citrine, and the color of the stones in this ring is very saturated. Some may not like that, but it's exactly what I was looking for. The stones are also very clear and sparkle nicely. The band is a decent thickness for the price and it's made well. I'm happy with it and I wouldn't hesitate to order another gemstone ring from Gem Avenue. <end>  amaizing beautiful  I neve thought that I'll be so happy with this product> Everyone is asking me were I got it from. It's really a very fine jewelry, just to put it in one frase amaizing beautiful! <end>
 B000HKVEVC  Sterling Silver Oval Cut Multi Gemstone 3mm Band Ring Size 5.5 ||	  Half size smaller fit - not sure why  Normally I wear a size 5.5 ring. I have a lot of semiprecious stone jewelry and loved the idea of a multicolor gemstone ring. The size 5.5 seemed to fit large - I measured it on a ring sizer I have and it looked to be between a 5.5 and a 6. I then ordered a size 5 and received it today. I wiggle it slightly to get it over my knuckle; once it's on, it fits fine. What's odd is that this ring measures a 5 and no bigger! I don't think I've ever been able to wear a size 5! I like all the gemstones except the amethyst, which is very light (lighter than pictured). The blue topaz is much darker than pictured and looks like a London blue. Since the amethyst is light, it's actually nice that the blue topaz next to it is dark. The other stones are as pictured. The stones all look pretty together and I like the ring, so I will be keeping the 5 and sending the 5.5 back. I contacted the vendor when I had problems with the sizing and they seemed to be helpful, so hopefully there should be no problems with the return. <end>  Just as beautiful as the picture  Flashy - but not too flashy - the stones are perfectly set, and prominent. Sparkling clarity. Love it! <end>  LOVE IT.  THIS RING HAS A STONE FOR EACH ONE OF MY FOUR CHILDREN AND A STONE FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER. THE PERFECT MOTHERS RING FOR ME. THE STONES A BRIGHT AND COLORFUL AND PERFECT IN EVERYWAY. THIS IS A KNOCK OUT RING AND I LOVE IT. <end>  even better when you get it!  This is a lovely ring- was even prettier when I got it! Has a nice weight and feel to it. I'm glad to add this to my jewelry collection. <end>  Clearly Beautiful!  This ring is even more beautiful in person! The stones are very clear and bright. Great colors! The ring looks great on my fuller fingers. Very substantial settings- stones are set high and even viewing the ring from the side is gorgeous. I definitely recommend this ring to anyone who is looking for a bold statement. <end>  Fantastic  I bought a much cheaper one from Amazon that looked good but was overpowering on my small hand. This fits and looks far neater, but the colour of the stones is what really took my breath away. Each colour is far brighter than I had hoped for. The amethyst is really deep purple not washed out looking and the blue topaz was really blue not at all white looking. WOW!!!! It looks like a very expensive white gold ring. I am truly pleased. <end>
 B000HKWCCW  Sterling Silver Oval Cut Peridot Gemstone Band 3mm Ring Size 7.5 ||	  GREAT in every way!  Ordered two rings, both are gorgeous! Love the way the rings are set. Stones are beautiful, and very clear! I get alot of compliments on both! I recommend the rings to all A++++, and seller is top notch too! <end>  Stones not very clear  The ring does have nice "architecture" as one reviewer noted, but the drawback for me is that the stones aren't clear, they are somewhat slightly muddy/hazy. If the stones were clear it would be a fantastic ring <end>
 B000HL08RC  Sterling Silver Oval Cut Garnet Gemstone 3mm Band Ring Size 4.5 ||	  Fabulous Ring  This is a beautiful ring. The color of the ring I received is Rhodolite in color. The silver is highly polished like white gold. The ring arrived quickly and was gift boxed. What a nice suprise. You will not be disapointed with this ring. <end>  Lovely ring  I got 2 rings of these, the other is an amethyst one, I absolutely love them not disappointed at all, I was pleasantly surprised of how well they look together or just one by itself. <end>  Beautiful ring  Beautiful ring. Great price. The garnets are rich in color, better in person. Fast delivery, excellent service, would buy again. <end>  No jewellery like this in Ireland  I am delighted with this ring. It looks like an old setting, and much more expensive than it actually is. It will make a great Christmas present. I would thoroughly recommend it. <end>  Perfect fit!  This ring goes perfectly with the multi-stone ring I ordered from the same seller. The silver band doesn't just flake away and turn my finger green like cheat rings do. It's a lovely ring that I will keep and wear for years! It's good enough quality to wear all the time! <end>  a little bulky  it's a beautiful ring but it's just a slight too bulky for my taste. maybe it's because my hand is fairly small but it looks really large on my finger. otherwise, not a bad price for the TCW. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I brought this ring as a gift to myself and I love it. Garnet is my birthstone. The stones are a little redder than I like...almost like a ruby, but it's still a beautiful ring for the price. <end>
 B000HL64PC  10 KT White Gold Comfort Fit 6mm Wide Wedding / Engagement Band Ring ||	  Perfect  Got this for my finace (now husband). It was the perfect size and we have had no problems with it. <end>  Beautiful ring...  The ring is everything I expected. It is beautiful out of the box, scratches a little upon wear, but nothing unexpected. The width and comfort fit band make the ring truly comfortable. <end>  wedding bands  We bought this wedding bands because we were in a rush. We decided in a Saturday to go next weekend to Vegas to get married and we need it something fast and cheap.For using a couple of months are fine, but they got scratched pretty fast, doesn't look as good anymore, and I'm working at a computer all day long. So I think you should buy something with more karats. <end>

 B000HLFS9A  14k Yellow Gold Link Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Great Mothers Day Gift  I bought this for mothers day for my mum and she adored itHighly recommended if you mother likes braceletsI might even buy one for myself <end>  WASTE of MONEY  THe bracelet is very nice in design - very lightweight - so not a tremendous value for gold but what completely disappointed me was that the links began to break after wear. I had to throw it in the garbage. <end>  Makes a Great Charm Bracelet  I bought this bracelet to use as a charm bracelet. I wanted something that would hold some of my childhood charms and allow me to add more over time. It's very pretty and well made. <end>
 B000HLFSAE  14k Yellow Gold Beaded Mesh Necklace, 17" ||	  Looks much nicer in person!  I bouth this necklace earlier this year when it was on sale.I thought it would be a nice casual necklace. When I first put it on my neck I was impressed. It looks a lot more expensive than Amazon's prices. I wore it a couple of times, and got comments on it. Now it's my favorite for wearing with my "little black dress", and to dress up outfits. <end>  it good for the price  i purchased it in the deal......for mothers day....and look very cute on kids..............i really got it for a very good price. <end>  very pretty  definitely nice for a slim girl in a dress. nice craft and it has the words "14K" on it. At the price I paid for, it is a steal. <end>
 B000HLFSBS  14k Yellow Gold and Enamel Pink Butterfly Pendant ||	  Beautiful  I think that the measurement of this pendant is stated wrong in the description, that measurement must be for the bail. <end>  Pendant dependant on penchant for being promiscuous  This pendant truly is gorgeous! I bought one for my boyfriend, Roger and he absolutely adores it. It seriously looks adorable on him, and I tell him that allllll the time. Here's where it gets bad though, I'm not the only one who thinks he looks like a total hunk in it! Yesterday, we were at this bar in queens, and this brokeback princess comes up to him and is seriously just allllll overrrr him. I'm like 'Roger, let's go home, baby. Time to leave before this #### makes me get all buckwild on him', but Roger just tries to play it all cool and we wind up staying at this bar for another hour and a half. Then, when we get back to my apartment, he tells me he feels like sleeping at his place that night. I'm like, 'whatever, roger' and let him go, but then today, because if i learned anything, it's that Roger is NOT a trustable man, I go to his house this morning to surprise wake him up with some starbucks, and guess who's there? Him and that man-stealing homewrecker from LAST night! anyways, it all started when I bought Roger this pendant. I guess overall, it's great if you want to cheat on your boyfriend, but not a good idea to buy your sexy significant other.3 stars. <end>
 B000HLJA94  Sterling Silver CZ Heart Two-pair Earring Set ||	  Cubic Zirconia earrings.  The items were received quickly, and the customer service representative that I spoke to on the phone was very helpful and friendly. The earrings were nicely packaged in a silver box. <end>
 B000HLJOU4  Lapis Healing Bear Dangle Earrings ||	  Wonderful Blue Bears  These are just wonderful lapis bear earrings. The carving is smooth and finished, with nice attention to detail. The findings are also carefully formed. There isn't a lot more to say - these are just gorgeous little totem bears.I would give it a 5-star rating, but for some reason the bails tend to slip out of my ears over the course of the day - it would have been nice if the company had included some of the little rubber stoppers to prevent this from happening. I've been forced to reshape the bails quite a bit in order to keep the earrings in my ears. <end>
 B000HLKVFG  14k Yellow Gold Soccer Charm ||	  Soccer Stuff  Dont miss this Charm if you are a real soccer fan. Like all amazon collection items this is even better looking then on the actual photo. <end>

 B000HLUBV0  One Stainless Steel Crescent  14g, 1/2" ||	  Beautiful Jewelry  I received my crescent today, Monday, after ordering on Friday, amazing! This crescent is so nice, highly polished & the perfect size for me. I love Steel Navel Jewelry, they have the best body jewelry around. Purchased this for my septum piercing & it's extremely comfortable, comes with several o rings in case you lose one and fits beautifully. It's not a pincher but can be tightened with a ring closing plier if you wish. I highly recommend it, it's well worth the money  -) <end>
 B000HM7TI2  14g, 5/8" Stainless Steel Internally Threaded Barbell - POST ONLY ||	  better than the rest  I found one on a super sale so I bought it thinking I'd never pay full price. Not true. I ordered some other cheap ones but they are terrible. Externally threaded, flawed bits. These guys make quality <end>
 B000HNFRP8  Southwestern Style Horse Story Band Ring in Sterling Silver and Chip Inlay Turquoise for Men or Women, Size 12, #10824 ||	  AWESOME!!!!  Just like it is in the picture. I am so happy with this product. Bought one for myself and my mom and I'm so glad I did. Size fits perfect and comfortable too. Would recomend this ring to anyone who loves horses!!! <end>  beautiful ring  The color is very vibrant - I think the ring is stunning. The contrast between the silver and the turquoise is lovely.It's a nice weight and very comfortable. I highly recommend it. It does run a bit small though so I'd order a size up. <end>  Nice Ring!  Picked this up as a gift for Valentines day and it was loved immediately! Is that enough of a recommendation or what?!?The color of the Turquoise is just as it was pictured here at amazon the silver is as expected, brilliant and shining.Note  Inside of the ring is not totally smooth and finished. Not sure why but it's smooth to the touch, but it is pitted probably from the manufacturing process. So if you were thinking of having an inscription engraved on the inner surface that isn't going to work. <end>
 B000HPVY62  Green Jade Long Drop Earrings and Pendant Set, 14k Gold ||	  Beautiful jade  This jewelry set is very beautiful. I love the elegant long drop of these earrings. <end>
 B000HQQX5S  Sterling Silver Puffed Heart Pendant, 16" ||	  Really great necklace  This is the perfect necklace to wear everyday. It is not danity but simple and elegant. I gave these to my sister and a friend and they love it too! Plus you really can't beat the price! <end>  very pretty  my sister loved this neckalace. i thought the pendant would be a little smaller, but overall still pretty. <end>  Better than the picture.  I ordered this necklace, expecting a basic heart necklace. To my surprise it is a verty pretty piece of jewelry and although I ordered it for my 4-year old daughter, I won't hesitate to use it myself. Super shiny and surprisingly heavy/sturdy which you can't tell by the picture. The heart is solid sterling silver, not hollow (with the exception of the hole where the chain goes through). Very well made.For $10 it was a great bargain. I'd be willing to pay more. <end>  Sterling Silver Puffed Heart Pendant, 16"  I love this, it's the perfect size, a solid weight & a good value. It's almost like a choker length but still on the medium to delicate side. <end>  Love it!!!  The necklace is beautiful. I found the chain a perfect length since I'm still nursing and it's just short enough that my baby can't rip it off me. Also at $16 (I got it on sale) it's a fabulous deal. Even at full price it would be a great gift for any girl. <end>  Beautiful and totally worth its price!  I bought 3 of these thinking that I would give them all as Christmas gifts, but I ended up keeping one for myself because once I saw it in person, I love it! Totally a steal for its price. <end>
 B000HR414C  Sparkling Antiqued-Style Sterling Silver Engagement or Wedding Band Ring Set Boxed with a 7mm Brilliant Round 2.2ct White Clear CZ Cubic Zirconia Size 6(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Missing Stone!  I was so excited when I received this ring in the mail, only to be disappointed when I discovered that one of the smaller stones was missing. I also think that the silver looks a little fake. I contacted the company and they told me send it back for a refund. <end>  Nice but...  One of the smaller stones was missing, but it's lower down on the side and no one will notice. The stones are gogeous, and I agree, the silver does look "fake", and it's not stamped like it should be for real silver, but I'll probably just keep it. <end>  Loose stone  I fell in love with this set the minute I saw it, so I bought it immediately. I wore it for about a week and the large center stone fell out. Down the shower drain!! Needs to be faceted stronger!!! While I'm a little disapointed, the company has responded quickly and super friendly and is replacing it immediately. <end>  Very pleased with this set  This is the 3rd wedding band set I've had since I got married in 2009. The first one was rhodium - turned my finger green. The second was white-gold plated - turned my finger green. I finally decided I was going to stick with sterling silver. I found this set and fell in love immediately. I have not had any issues with it, and I've worn the set daily for over a year. All of my friends keep telling me they are jealous that I've got such a beautiful bridal set (and they all think it's loaded with diamonds, so even better!)Only downside is that it gets dirty very quickly, and take a lot of elbow grease to get the black marks off the bottom of the bands, even with regular cleaning. <end>  Love the antique feel!!!  This ring is a nice reproduction, at a low cost. It's rally pretty, and the way the sides are detailed, is beautiful. <end>  I love it  This ring is beutiful!!I love the antique look, and I'm crazy about silver.My fiance proposed and even though I picked out the ring my self I was still amazed on how pretty it is.I brought it to a silver Jewlery shop and He could not make it smaller because of the way its set,We ordered a 6 but my ring size is a 4.he told me if I brought it some where else then the stones would of fallen out if they tried to resized it smaller but it can be increased in size ,but He put a ring guard on it and I'm very happy with that because the ring means so much to me and my fiance.Thank you for such great sevice,and a wonderful keepsake. <end>
 B000HR5YD4  New 925 Sterling Silver Thumb Ring Filigree Band size 7 ||	  Terrible  This is a terrible product. It is not .925 sterling silver, it turned my thumb green. Took forever to arrive. There was odd filling where the openings were suppose to be. I regret buying this. <end>  Horrible!  Does not look anything like the picture. Poorly made, tarnishes horribly and was a very strange color when it arrived - and even stranger now! Avoid this ring! <end>
 B000HR5Z10  New Sterling Silver 3 MM Plain Thumb Ring Band size 11 ||	  Size runs *very* large...  I first ordered a size 10, which was correct for my thumb according to the ring size charts available on Amazon. It was WAY too large. I then ordered a size 9 and it was still too large. I would recommend at least 2 full sizes lower than Amazon suggests.Otherwise, the ring is not "fine jewelry", but it has a fun, comfortable shape and is a little more interesting than a plain band. The quality is good, but silver is soft and so it bends easily. I would buy it again (in the right size). <end>  Nice for the thumb  I do like this thumb ring. I have never worn one before, but wearing it, I barely notice it's there. I like how it's curved for the shape of the thumb too. Great buy! <end>  Green Thumb  I was very displeased with this ring. I was under the impression that it was Sterling Silver. I don't know that I would agree with that. All of my jewelry is sterling silver and can be worn everyday with no problem (other than occassional cleaning). This was not the case with this ring. I had this ring on for only a couple of hours when I received my first compliment. Image my surprise when I took it off to let them try it on and looked down and you could see the entire design still on my thumb only in the form of a dark green tinted impression. <end>
 B000HR862A  New Sterling Silver Ladies Wide Thumb Ring Band Size 7 ||	  Nice ring  I got my ring today. It's nice and shiny, a bit overpowering. It's still a keeper, though. <end>
 B000HRAYJ8  Midnight Gem Sorcerer's Dragon Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Excellent  The navel ring was in excellent shape! It seems to be durable, and it is worn easily. <end>
 B000HRH6IK  Crystalline Gem Pearl Pink Butterfely Belly Ring ||	  Okay  The pink isn't that bright it is more dull and not very exciting. I bought this ring a few months ago and think i have yet to wear it because of the dullness of it's color. <end>
 B000HRH6JO  PIRATES LOCK Belly Ring ||	  cute but uncomfortable  Very cute belly ring but is uncomfortable for me when the top of the lock pinches my skin. <end>
 B000HRH6OO  Pink Silicone Rose Belly Ring ||	  Such a shame!  This belly ring looked very cute on the website but didn't live up to it in person. While the detail on the rose is nice, it is angled downward so while the ring is in, you cannot see the folds and it just looks like a regular ball. The photograph here is very deceiving and taken at a bad angle to make it look like the rose is just tilted downward. When you look at the ring head on in the correct position, all you see are the green "leaves." As I stated above, it then just looks like a two toned ball at the bottom of the barbel and no amount of contortion will reveal the design while it is in the piercing. I then decided to try it on upside down so that the flower would be at the top so you could at least see the detail. It looked a little strange but better than before but the rose promptly fell off. I had to krazy glue it back into position. It was a wonderful idea but terrible execution. <end>  Cute but FELL APART  This was super cute, but the silicone flower fell off after less than an hour! <end>  Too cute, but not functional.  I bought this seeing that it is very cute. I recieved it in the mail, and while I was taking it out of the package, the rose popped right off the bar. Couldn't even try it on before it needed to be fixed. Although the company is amazing, but this particular product of theirs is not good. <end>
 B000HRPI44  23K Gold Electroplated Bass Tie Tack ||	  Bass Tie Tack (Gold Plated)  I ordered a gold plated tie tack for my male friend about two weeks prior to Christmas. Naturally, I was nervous about it getting here prior to Christmas.As it turned out, it was here in about three days. The tracking service was excellent and told me exactly where the order was and what to expect as delivery time.The product is beautiful and was packaged very well. I am very pleased with my ordering experience with Amazon.com. I had never ordered from them before so was a little leery. <end>
 B000HRTPPM  23K White Gold Electroplated Tie Chain ||	  Satisfied  This item does what its supposed to do. It holds my tie in place and looks really nice while doing it.  D <end>
 B000HUWXSA  Modish 10 KT Gold Engravable Medical Alert Pendant 10K Charm ||	  Beautiful, but too small to engrave  This item is priced well, but it is WAY too small to engrave anything on that anyone could read - not to mention that the back is not smooth, it's 'pebbly'. The best use for it is to hang it off an existing medical id bracelet near the clasp, so that if the face plate is turned around, the caduceus is visible. <end>
 B000HVJ6UC  Solid 14kt Yellow Gold 2mm Red Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Nose Stud ||	  Exactly as Shown and in a cute wooden box  I just recently got my nose pierced and this was the first nose ring I put in after the stud. It is tiny and was easy to put in, much more comfortable than the hook kind. I can even blow my nose normally! It came quickly and in a nice velvet bag within a wooden box. I'm ordering more in different colors, I love it. <end>
 B000HVJ7PQ  18 Gauge PINK GEM Flexible Clear Nose Ring ||	  nose ring  good if you are able to put these types of rings in , not as flexable as they say they are. <end>
 B000HVL3F8  18 Gauge Steel Ball BIOPLAST Nose Ring ||	  Most comfortable nose jewlery available!  I've had more than my fair share of piercings that have come and gone over the years and for some reason, I got a bee in my bonnet to have my nose pierced. As is my penchant, I did more than a little research on where to go and about the jewelry I wanted.When I got to the piercing establishment of choice for my area (noted to have a good selection of jewelry) the guy told me that he only pierced with a nose bone (straight pin with small retaining bump on the end) and could not put in nose screws, and never put a ring in for a nose piercing.I realize this is contrary to most advice, as rings are easiest for healing and the nose bone is infamous for not staying in place. I went ahead, assuming the guy knew his business and honestly I didn't want to wait to find someone else. I was pierced with a 16 gauge needle, and the nose bone is 20 gauge (wha?). Then he tells me 8 out of 10 girls come back because the stud fell out in the first three days, but if I could keep the thing in that long my piercing would heal around the jewelry eventually - and I'd be all set.Needless to say after I got home, the thing kept popping up like a turkey timer, it just wasn't long enough or big enough to stay in the hole made by the larger gauge needle and because of the slight swelling, the nose bone wasn't long enough to go all the way through. I was forever pushing it back in, and every time I touched my nose, I was just asking for an infection. I resorted to keeping the thing stuck down with a little super glue (which worked and is sterile) for the first two days until I could hunt down better jewelry.I tried other nose bones (no go). I tried the traditional metal screw, and right angle pins. No, no no. Nothing fit. The screw and angles wouldn't go through my nose, just into the skin inside. Ouch, ouch, ouch! Then my bioplast gem arrived.Because of it's flexibility, I was able to bend it straight to fish it through (with a little ointment to lubricate it) and it slid in on the first try. Unlike metal screws which are notorious for hanging out of your nostril (because they aren't one size fits all noses), the soft bioplast is easily tucked well up inside your nose, the gem fits snugly against the skin for a sparkling freckle effect that is very subtle, and it's SO comfortable you don't even feel it.It's also very easy to clean around, especially with a q-tip (which is also a great way to place the inner loop to where you want it), and I suspect I won't have to touch it again, other than for cleanings, until it's completely healed in about six weeks.I've had my ears pierced many times (lobe and cartilage), my labret, my eyebrow, my navel, my tongue and the web between my thumb and first finger. None of those piercings have been as much trouble as this silly little nose piercing, and all because of bad jewelry. They shouldn't use ANY other kind of material for nose screws than this stuff. I wasted a ton of money on stuff that doesn't work, and doesn't fit. I'm amazed after all the fooling with it I did, I haven't gotten an infection.Do yourself a favor, and get one of these. Even if your piercer doesn't carry them, have one on hand for after the fact because everything else (other than a hoop) will just cause you grief. <end>  Good ring  I'm happy with this nose ring. It's comfortable. The silver ball is a bit larger than I thought it would be, but in no way overwhelming. <end>  Excellent Product  I love the look of a simple, classic silver ball, and the bioplast makes this nose ring as comfortable as it can be. However, I happen to have an uncommonly thick nose wall (?) and so it pinched me a little bit, as the bend started a little earlier than I would like--but I'm kind of an odd-ball on that account. The bend isn't L-shaped; it's a wider angle, which is super. The bioplast makes it really easy to insert, which is a MAJOR concern of mine. (I would feel comfortable putting in and taking this out every day if I had to do so.) It took me a few days to find that one position where the tail wouldn't poke the inside of my nose, since the tail is pretty long, but that could be easily fixed by clipping it with nail clippers or something similar. Good product, arrived promtly. <end>
 B000HVMZXW  18 Gauge CLEAR ACRYLIC CONE Nose Screw Retainer ||	  Eh...  When putting this in and taking it out, it caused a lot of discomfort. I know how to use a corkscrew type nose ring, yet this one is very sharp and uncomfortable. BUT, it did the job and it keeps my employers not noticing my nose ring. However, I did cut off the long part of the corkscrew so that it is just an L ring now. <end>  Never even attempted to wear.  This nose screw needs to be sanded down. It appears it is put together from two pieces, and the junction is riddled with sharp plastic-y points. I opted not to shred my nose up in an attempt to get it in. If you have sand paper and feel like finishing the product, then it may well be worth it. <end>  Clear nose ring  Excellent product, exactly what I was looking for. Shipping a little expensive for such a small product. <end>
 B000HVN324  18 Gauge Red Flexible Nose Bone ||	  Freaky  I received it in a timely manner. It's just i didn't think it would look like my nose was bleeding. Consider that when you purchase this. <end>
 B000HVP1A6  Clear GLOW in the DARK CONE Nose Ring ||	  Great product looks silly  The item is great if you want to look like you have a spike sticking out of your nose. Which I look silly in lol. <end>
 B000HWS1AW  Pave Crossed Princess Cut Aquamarine CZ Ring ||	  Pave Crossed Princess Cut Aquamarine CZ Ring  As with two other rings I just bought from HopeChestJewelry, the blue stone in this ring is much more dull-looking compared to the picture. But the ring design is strikingly unique and its craftsmanship is superb. I'm very happy with my purchases and highly recommend this ring (and the other two). <end>
 B000HX39R6  Oval Cut Swiss Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Sparkling  I am happy with this purchase. Stone is sparkly and for $15.99 this is a great deal. <end>
 B000HX3AMA  Heart Cut Peridot Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Good deal  The package arrived 2 days early.There is a little cute black gift box which looks great and the necklace is perfect.Totally satisfied. <end>  Beautiful jewelry item  I feel you should know before you buy the product that if it comes with a chain. Because on the page it seemed as if it didn't come with a chain but luckily for me it did. The picture for this product was great and that's how it looked. The description was absolutely perfect and it was the necklace I bought. Besides that the necklace came as promised and it came faster than I expected it to come and the product description was great except I wasn't sure if it came with a chain. <end>
 B000HX3AO8  Round Cut Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Citrine necklace  This necklace is beautiful. I bought this for someone to wear with a gold dress knowing that they only wear silver. The stone is a bit less "yellowy" than the photo would suggest. Looked great next to gold fabric. <end>
 B000HX3BD8  Heart & Pear Cut Amethyst Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Very Impressed!!  I LOVE this necklace!! Great quality, nice packaging!! I definitely will be buying more stuff from them!!! VERY HAPPY!! <end>
 B000HX3BK6  Round Cut London Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Gorgeous blue  The pendant is just as pictured, vibrant blue, with a quirky setting. It gets attention! <end>  gorgeous gift idea  I bought this for my mom's birthday last year and she loved it! Wears it almost everyday and to my knowledge has had no problems with it. It shipped quick and came in a cute purple box so I didnt have to wrap it. I have also purchased peora necklaces for my sister, mother in law and best friend. Love it! <end>
 B000HX3BLA  Round Cut Amethyst Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Lovely Pendant!  I really love this pendant! The chain is very nice quality and the pendant itself is the perfect size for what I was looking for. The stone has a very nice rich purple color and is very clear without inclusions. Very good buy. <end>  Dainty-More please  A dainty, classic design piece and I would have liked matching earrings. Good color but a bit on the small side. <end>
 B000HX3D9U  Heart Cut Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  They have much better designs  I love Peora, but this particular setting does not show off the gemstone very well. Even in the photo you can tell that the stone doesn't have a whole lot of brilliance. If you're looking for a heart-shaped cut, I suppose this is a nice setting, but honestly this particular piece doesn't show up very well, so I would suggest to keep looking. <end>
 B000HX58V6  Round Cut Swiss Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  I'd give it 5 stars if it came in white gold  I love the color of the pendant, absolutely stunning. I get quite a lot of attention from it when I wear it. It's a good size topaz to have a short chain.. but if it's a long chain, it might not be. <end>
 B000HX58Z2  Multicut Citrine London Blue Topaz Peridot Three Stone Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Best Buy  I have made five jewelry purchases and this was my favorite one! The chain was a shiny box chain and the gems were a good size with a thick amount of sterling silver that made it look like a quality piece. <end>  Peridot, topaz, and citrine necklace a perfect gift!  My mother in-law loves blue topaz, peridot, and citrine. She has numerous separate pieces. I purchased the necklace to match the other jewelry items that she owns. I was not disappointed. They stones are clear and shine great! I know she will be pleased. I think I made a great purchase for a great price and quick delivery. <end>
 B000HX5A0K  Heart & Pear Cut Peridot Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  so disappointed  I was totally disappointed with this item. It was lovely, but would not lie flat. It always tipped to one side or the other because of the way it was put together. I wrote to the seller, and asked if they could fix this, and sent it back paying my own shipping, but all they did was refund some of my money, and charge me a 5 dollar restocking fee - for an item that was basically defective. Beware. <end>
 B000HX5AKA  Pear Cut Peridot Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Good look, too small, cheap metal  This piece defiantly appears to be either silver plated or possibly just painted, defiantly not pure, but if that doesn't bother you... It's a fine piece. <end>
 B000HX5AUK  Oval Cut Moonstone Filigree Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Satisfied  This necklace looks just like the picture. Also came with a nice, dainty chain which I was not expecting. <end>
 B000HX5AXM  Oval Round Cut Amethyst Three Stone Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Pretty, but small  I purchased this to wear for a wedding, but the silver outshined the stones, which seems to disappear. I returned this item. <end>
 B000HX5BAE  Cross Pendant With Oxidized Bead Accents Sterling Silver ||	  Wonderful Oxidized Cross  This cross was everything I expected,and then some! Very substantial and heavy.I am extremely pleased with this purchase, great buy for the price!Recommend highly for anyone who may have doubts about how this looks once you get it home.It looks better than you think it will, trust me. <end>
 B000HX7ADK  Heart Cut London Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  very nice for the price  this is an adorable necklace that is perfect for a younger girl. very nice quality for the price! <end>
 B000HX7B5C  Multicut Amethyst Three Stone Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Nice design  Delivery was faster than expected. The gems were not as dark purple as in the picture but i still like it. Nice cut. Quite sparkly. The chain was also very pretty <end>
 B000HX7BIO  Oval Cut London Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Showstopper  This pendant has become one of my favorite "go to" pieces of jewelry. The sparkle and clarity are top notch, the lovely chain is just right for the pendant and it is as bright and tarnish-free as the day I bought it. Great value for a really beautiful pendant. <end>
 B000HX7BMA  Pear Cut Amethyst Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  pretty purple pendant  Peora necklaces are always very pretty and quickly shipped. I'm not a fan of the chains though, but I've been buying the pendants to put on homemade beaded necklaces for my bridesmaids. This one is my favorite, its cute but not a cheesy cute. Usually with Peora pendants I get them and am surprised by how small they are, while this one is listed with no measurements(it is approximately 20mm tall and 8mm at the widest point) its actually much bigger than I expected. It's beautiful and I can't wait to wear it to my wedding! <end>  MD review II  Gave this pendant for Christmas, and it was a big hit! Setting looks like white gold and the stone is clear and beautiful. All Peoria items are high quality and gorgeous. <end>
 B000HX7CSI  Round Cut Peridot Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  excellent  I love peridot so I may be a little biased yet this pendant is just gorgeous. However, be prepared that it is tiny. <end>
 B000HX7D0A  Trillion Cut London Blue Topaz/Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Very happy!  really nice product - just as described. Good quality and arrived faster than expected. Really good value - have used this site for many presents. <end>
 B000HX81VK  Round Cut London Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful Little Pendant by Peora  This is a lovely pendant. The stone is excellent and the silver setting is excellent. The silver is not icy white as it appears in photo. It looks more like white gold. Even the chain is great quality. It does not twine like some silver chains will do. The photo doesn't do it justice. It is a feminine piece. The way the silver setting frames the the solitare is unique and beautiful. The price is really a give a way. The chain alone is worth more than the asking price. The seller is Peora. Their delivery was super speedy-two days from placing my order and the delivery was free! This is my second purchase from Peora. I am really liking this company. <end>  Very Beautiful  This is a very beautiful and high quality pendant and necklace, worth much more than the selling price. The sale price is great, there was no shipping fee, and for some reason I received a $2.60 off discount. The package came in about two business days, and in perfect condition.The gem color isn't exactly what it looks like in the picture; it's a bit lower-tone, but it is a very pretty, subtle blue, that would match well with any casual blue top. If you are looking for brighter, or more teal type of blue, I would suggest to look at the "Swiss Cut Topaz" which is identical and by the same company -- just search it. In conclusion, I'd like to say that I am very pleased with this necklace, and its company. <end>  A Fantastic Value  I don't write many reviews, and I'm not a jewelry nut like the previous viewer, but she (?) was absolutely right -- this is a fantastic value.It comes in a beautiful box (that's unusual by itself), with a lovely chain and the unique pendant is .. well, beautiful. I think Mother's gonna love it.And free shipping from Peora, too. I'll be looking for items from this merchant again! <end>
 B000HX823W  Pear Cut London Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Blue Topaz pendant  I am pleased with this pendant. The one thing that I'm somewhat dissatisfied with is that when I wear it with blue it takes on a greenish hue. I bought it to wear with blue. <end>
 B000HYL3MS  Authentic University of Texas Basketball Bracelet ||	  Very original  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece. She is a big Longhorns fan. Though I never would condone Longhorn support...Red Raiders fan all the way, I swallowed my pride and got this for her. I know she will love it. It is very original, who else in her circle will have one, really? Now...can we put one out with some Double T's? <end>
 B000HZ7Y1G  Silver-Tone Patterned Layered Metal Heart Stretch Bracelet ||	  Not as shiny as pictured  The textured pattern on this bracelet makes it look a rather dull gray color. The one I received is darker and not as shiny as the image on Amazon. <end>
 B000HZD3L6  Brown Leather Magnetic Money Clip by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Husband is pleased  I bought this money clip for my husband because the one he had before broke. He is pleased and I don't see how this one can break. He is pleased so I am pleased. <end>  great product  The money clip was just what my husband wanted. I was happy with the price and he was happy with the gift. Win all the way around! <end>  Brown Leather Money Clip  Purchased this as a gift for my father, who needs to replace his money clip every 2 years or so. This clip is a rich brown color, however the leather seems on the inexpensive side (but this is an inexpensive clip, so that's to be expected). The magnet is strong and holds cash and a card or two securely. Great little money clip for the price, simple and stylish. <end>
 B000HZGNZE  Singapore 10 Cent "Seahorse and Seaweed" Two Tone Coin Cut Out Pendant with 18" Chain ||	  Given as a gift, recipient like it.  Bought this and related jewelry as gifts for family members. We thought they were very nice and they like them. The price is fair for what they are. <end>
 B000HZGO6C  Greek 2 Drachma "Owl" Two Tone Coin Pendant with 18" Chain ||	  GREEK OWL COIN PENDANT  I was unhappy with the quality of the Greek Drachma coin that I ordered. The coin is somewhat scratched to begin with, and basically looks rather cheap. I would not recommend the purchase of this type of pendant, and suggest you save your money. <end>  Gold Owl  I went through a slight Athena craze and bought this necklace. It is very well made and the length is perfect. It was a good buy and I really enjoy it. <end>  Great gift  My 10-year-old daughter is in Greek myths phase. I gave her this pendant and she absolutely loved it. <end>
 B000HZI14U  Buffalo Nickel Two Tone Coin Earrings ||	  I love these earrings!  I just love these buffalo nickel earrings. They are very attractive and go with most casual wear. I've received many compliments. Thank you.I will order more jewelry from you. <end>
 B000I0M2A8  Modern Silver Tipped Navy Blue Enamel Cone Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Nice looking product  I must admit I know nothing about cuff links, but these came in quickly and look very nice. They came in a nice silver looking box that makes a nice presentation. They are a gift and we will see if they hold up. Overall, a good experience. <end>  Lightweight but makes a solid impression.  First, let me say that I am not affiliated with [...] at all other than the fact that I just bought these and about 25 other cufflinks from Cuffdaddy.com for my husband and I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Packed neatly in the box which arrived with no damage, all the cufflinks were beautiful, each was packed in a shiny chrome gift box with no scuffs or prints, each set was substantial in weight and feel, expensive looking and unique. There were no chips, dings, damage, flaking of enamel, not even any smudges. These were clean, new, shiny and as the description says, unique. Overall, I highly recommend Cuffdaddy.com for their excellent customer service. I have been a customer for a couple of years at a certain cufflink retailer who carries several artists (with much higher prices) and made the switch for the customer service experience with cuffdaddy.com. They are real people who care about you and treat you like a person they want to do business with and keep business with. If you want good prices, excellent customer service and nice cufflinks at a very good price, shop from cuffdaddy.com. As for the particulars about these links  The blue enamel is glossy, no chips or scuffs, lifting or peeling. The silver color is shiny, no dings, scratches or dents. Not cheap looking at all. Traditional flip fastner link. Not easy to lose. Very nice. Looks fab with both traditional and non-traditional color shirts. Cuffdaddy.com...when are you gonna start carrying shirts? Hint. Hint. Hint. <end>  Super nice cufflinks at a low price  I have bought several sets of cufflinks or cufflinks and ties from Cuff-Daddy and have never been disappointed. These were a gift for my son and he says they are his new favorites. Classy and versatile and well made. I highly recommend Cuff Daddy for fast and accurate service and very reasonable prices. Plus the box often matches the contents. A great deal all around. <end>
 B000I0M2KS  Chic Aquamarine Blue Catseye-style Cufflinks ||	  great present  I bought these cufflinks for a friend whos birthstone is aquamarine.The quality of the stone is far exceeded my expectations.It arrived fast and in a nice present box. <end>  WORTH EVERY DIME SPENT  I received these cuff links today and I am 100% satisfied with the product. The stones are as they appear on the photographs on amazon.com and the side greek details adds a layer of quality to the workmanship that makes the cuff link look super expensive. The finishing is also perfect. I would recommend this as a buy to any collector or as a gift to someone. <end>  Lovely  This is my son's birthstone and I bought these for my husband for Father's Day. The stone is gorgeous and the size is perfect. The design adds just the right detailing as well. And these are far less expensive than comparable cufflinks. Highly recommended. <end>
 B000I0O350  Textured Goldtone Metal Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Beautiful cuff links  These are beautiful cuff links. The textured surface is a nice touch, and their size (about 1/2") makes them a nice size for ladies shirts. <end>

Made a great gift!Thanks! <end>  Prettier in Person  My boyfriend picked this out and ordered it for me on my birthday. The picture doesn't do it any justice...its a very shiny silver ring and the CZ's look very nice and give a pretty sparkle. I just got it so i'm not sure how it holds up but as of right now i would recommend! <end>
 B000I23MDC  Round Cubic Zirconia CZ Two Carat Wedding Band - Size 8.0 - JewelryWeb ||	  Love it!  Great for the price and bling! You get a lot of sparkle from the "gems" and the band size and size of the CZs are perfect. <end>
 B000I38OHA  Sterling Silver Oval Shape Peridot, Amethyst, Topaz, Garnet and Citrine Gemstone 0.10 inch Long Heart Pendant ||	  WOW,WOW, AND WOW  THIS IS A VERY PRETTY NECKLACE. THE GEMSTONE ARE FULL OF COLOR. JUST LIKE THE PICTURE. <end>
 B000I3OTNI  Amazon.com  Snow Globe Ring-laser Silver (6.5)  Clothing ||	  So unique and fun!...many compliments  I purchased this about a year ago and yes it did start to leak after a few days but I realized it's because the little ball stopper that keeps the water in was not pushed in enough. All I did was push it in better with a pen and I never had a problem again...so just do that first when you get it. I love it so much that I am going to get 2 more in case this ever breaks and I can't find it again. <end>  save your money  I love the idea of this ring. Sadly it was half full (or should i say half empty) when it arrived and was leaking. <end>  customer service  This vendor made every effort to make sure that freezing temps before didn't damage this (it has liquids that can freeze and burst the ring seal). Unfortunately when it did arrive damaged I contacted the vendor who promptly reshipped the item which arrived in perfect condition. It is a bit overpriced but what the heck - it's Christmas.. <end>  So fun  This ring is so cute. Perfect for the Holiday season and such a conversation starter. This is my second one I've owned. The first one lost it's liquid after a year or so but I loved it so much I bought a new one. The other reviews said that their drained rather quickly so I just put a dab of super glue in the hole around the plug and it's been fine. It was also delivered on a day that an unexpected snow fall happened and no problems although I wouldn't recommend putting it in the freezer. <end>
 B000I3ZF6I  Earrings - E42 - Gold Crystal Circle Dangle ~ Jet & Black Diamond ||	  Very cheap looking, not at all like the photograph  The metal portions of the earrings are a very cheap-looking yellow, not at all like the photograph. I bought them for a present, and had to buy something else. <end>
 B000I4311I  Earrings - E41 - Crystal Circle Dangle - Gold Tone Metal ~ Clear AB (Iridescent) ||	  does not match photo at all  The earrings do not look at all like the photograph. The metal is a very cheap looking yellow tone. <end>
 B000I5LFV0  #1 Godfather MM7722512 ||	  Hard to find piece of jewelry  I'm glad I was able to find this charm. It's hard to find jewelry to give as a gift to the godfather of your child. All the other charms you will find resemble the Godfather mobster movie... Also most jewelry places won't carry any jewelry for Godfather's because they say it's too "taboo"... (I was told this when asking why no one had gold charms for god fathers.. If you are looking for a charm for this occasion this would be the one! <end>
 B000I650LA  14g Vibrating Barbell Tongue Ring Body Piercing Jewelry ||	  Given as a Gift  I bought this as a gift for my sister.. unfortunately she used it until the batteries ran out.. I'm not even going to ask her what she was doing to make them run out so fast. <end>  So Fun!  The ring is a bit big inside but the vibrations are strong and do their job. Also fun to make out with. Great accessory! Also comes with an extra battery which is a plus!! <end>  Big  Its kinda big for my mouth. Im not sure what im suppose to do with it now that i bought it when it won't fit in my mouth. Wish it was smaller. It would have been awesome if you put the ring up to something like a quarter to let people see how big it was before we actually buy it. IM JUST SAYING! <end>  ouch  vibrates on your teeth not even comfortable to have in your mouth not worth buying it for the price that it is sold for <end>  Too big!  Previous comments were about right...it's too big so it doesn't work in his mouth very well but does feel great! The only thing is he can't do it for very long. I don't remember why something about it hitting his teeth I think...so really it feels good but if you only get it for 30 seconds it isn't that worth it. <end>
 B000I67T0A  DESIGINER INSPIRED CZ RINGS - Pretty Marquise CZ Engagement Ring ||	  poor customer service and product representation  I ordered this in late Feb & when arrived, much smaller than pictured. Returned 3-1-10 and as of 4-18-10, no correspondence from company or any refund. <end>
 B000I6L4YC  Men's Titanium Dog Tag Pendant, 20" ||	  great pendant, terrible necklace  I bought this with full expectations of receiving a 20" chain and pendant, titanium, brushed finish, and all that. And, yep, that's indeed what it is. My gripe stems from the fact that almost immediately I started getting a rash around my neck from the chain. I'm definitely not allergic to titanium. Upon closer inspection, I found the chain links on the chain to be *sharp*. I ran my fingertips across it and they caught on each link, and when you look closely you see the sharp edges on the link. Bananas. I like the pendant so I won't return it, but otherwise this would be back in the box and on its way to the customer returns center. Be forewarned. <end>  Ti Dog Tag+Chain  This is actually a great piece of men's jewelry. I am allergic to silver, and gold is too soft for me. That leaves me with the choice of titanium, which proves to be a great metal. Not only is it hypoallergenic, it is strong and masculine as well. For any guy who likes to wear gold necklaces, this is an awesome alternative, and it is much stronger than gold! <end>  Why negative reviews?  My point- the picture obviously shows a brushed finish, as compared to the piece that connects it to the chain, and the description states "20 inch chain", I am uncertain why the negative reviews reflect the product, rather than the buyer's reluctance to investigate the item before purchase. I have one, and it is exactly as described. I'm very happy with the purchase. It is light, not "flashy" and offers a nice alternative to "bling". Buy one with confidence. <end>  Stylish Titanium for the New Decade.  I have read all the reviews but had purchased one as a gift for someone and I loved It so much It's taken me over a year to get one for myself.As far as the look, totally great. And the chain length? Perfect! It's right where you can see It with a shirt or sweatshirt with a collar and only 1 button undone.It's the perfect length really. I took off gold for this!Now I've worn It (And I have a long hairline In back) I don't see a problem at all with the chain rubbing on my neck or anything.I also like the brushed titanium not the shiny look. This Is much more masculine.Nice piece Amazon.I'm not sure what they could have used for a more expensive looking chain to match but this one matches nice.And as I learned this is a good alternative to gold today. The hypoallergenic part Is nice.This Is a nice piece of jewelry. Especially when on sale! Can't say how much I paid!And to The Reviewer who thinks the chain Is In contrast. I beg to differ. Although It may not be an Ideal chain for Titanium It does match well.This make a VERY nice gift without going overboard. And guys would wear and appreciate It.Or great for a young adult still In High School. To have his own look. <end>  chain  i just received my product today i am not at all pleased with the chain with this product. i was to believe that the pendant and the thin chain were both titaniumIt looks very cheap and no shine or sheen even through the plastic it came in.i was very disappointed when i opened up the box it came in.i feel very disappointed basically just paying $70 for a small pendant. The contrast between the pendant and the chain is too off colourim very hesitant about buying jewelry online now even more <end>  hmmmm,,,  very short chain. i would have probally bought another item if i knew it was this small. <end>
 B000I6ORMI  Men's Stainless Steel and Ebony Round Pendant, 20" ||	  Small but well made  The photo gives you the impression that the pendant is about the size of a silver dollar. It is only about the size of a quarter. I am very disappointed about this. Amazon does not offer any dimensions of the pendant, only the necklace. This is the second jewelry item that I bought on Amazon and they both have the same problem. The photos make the item appear almost twice as large as in real life. I feel somewhat cheated and mislead. Amazon should show jewelry on real people or offer actual size photos. Until Amazon does this I will no longer buy any jewelry from them. <end>
 B000I6ORNM  Men's Titanium 2.7mm Venetian Box Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  Not bad, but could be better.  Overall I am very satisfied with this chain. However, the links are not crimped smooth enough or tight enough. They tend to kink regularly, though not terribly. It takes only a second to straighten them out, but I wish they wouldn't kink like that in the first place. <end>  Solid titanium?  After a few years of wear, the finish wore off and started to iritate my skin. To my knowledge solid titanium would not have done this. The description did not indicate that the necklace was plated. Simply, metal  titanium. Otherwise, I like the style and size. <end>  Not everyone can be a winner....  This did not look like the picture. Nothing on the necklace or packaging stated this was titanium. The clasps were loose and there were visible bronzish color welds. It actually came in tape, so it was sticky! I do have to say that the return through Amazon was very easy and they also returned my shipping. <end>  love it  I bought this for myself (female) and love it. I'm amazed at how light it is. I've worn it many times and have had no problems with kinks. The clasp is a bit small and I do have a problem getting it on (even with my nails) but it's worth the trouble. <end>  Thin Elegance  This is an attractive, elegant chain. It makes a discreet, masculine statement. The only thing I would chahge is the clasp. It is a little too small for my large fingers. <end>  Might be too small for a man's neck but it works for me  The box chain is a nice casual necklace for everyday wear. The chain is light weight and feels good to wear. Have not had an issue with kinks or hair tangles. <end>  disappointed  I try to accustom myself to items not looking as impressive in reality as they do in advertisements. However, the titanium necklace was a total let-down. It is just a dull-looking little, and I mean Little, chain. Wish I hadn't fallen for it. <end>
 B000I7P5AK  Sterling Silver Polished Dangle Stars Earrings ||	  cheap metal!  This turned my ears green! And after wearing them only a handful of times one of the stars fell of. Not worth the purchase at all!! <end>
 B000I84QZO  Acrylic Deluxe 7-Drawer Jewelry Chest ||	  Beautiful item  This truly is a beautiful item. It arrived well packaged and didn't have a scratch on it. It is definitely sturdy without being too bulky. I ended up ordering a second as I liked this so much. One hold makeup, and the other is jewelry. No drawer stops, but in my opinion this is a plus for moving drawers around and being able to keep this above eye height.Great product, would definitely recommend!!! <end>  BEST IDEA EVER!!!  Like most I saw a similar item on the Kardashian show and I was on a hunt for it. I found this and read the reviews and decided to try it. It is GREAT. It fits everyting. I bought a seperate holder for my brushes, they fit in the drawers, but I just wanted that drawer space to put my sharpners, tweezers, & etc. It is my one stop I love the fact that you can see what is in every drawer, I have everything in one place. I loved it so much I got my cousin to order it too. <end>  My Second one  I Love this jewelry box...this is my second one. Gave one as a gift. Great Seller and fast shipping...highly recommend, but check back often because the price fluxuates. <end>  Perfect!  I needed something to help me keep my cosmetics organized and this is just right. It is sturdy, well-made, and looks great. You can see where everything is, just pull out a drawer and you'll find what you need. Watching the Khardashians, I was envious of the lucite chests on their bathroom vanities that house their cosmetics, so I was searching for the right one for me. I have a lot of makeup (nothing in comparison to the Ks' collections) and found what I lovingly call the "Khardashian Starter Set". I am very pleased with my purchase and have recommended it to friends. Who knows, I may buy another one. <end>  acrylic jewelry chest  A little pricey, but worth it since it looks so nice and is well built. I'm using it for make-up and frequently used jewelry on my bathroom vanity. My vanity isn't covered now, while everything is organized in this 7 drawer chest. <end>  heavy quality acrylic  I had seen this chest in a specialty store catalogue and fell in love with it. I saved a lot of money by ordering it through Amazon.It sits on my dressing table filled with my make-up and I'm overjoyed.Great quality. <end>  Wonderful  I had seen a post on Pintrest using this chest as a make up organizer. The acrylic is nice and thick. Looks are so stylish. I highly recommend this to anyone! <end>  Holds Everything  My daughter wanted one to hold her makeup. This case is marketed for Jewelry. Doesn't matter cause they are one and the same and it was cheaper. Great quality and drawers slide in and out easily. Organizes everything and anything. Bought a second one for my other daughter away at college. <end>  Not impressed!!!!!  Not too happy with this item,for the price I this it too small and flimsy.It seemed much larger on the picture.j <end>  What a beautiful chest!  I'm so happy with this purchase! It's a high quality, classy looking clear acrylic, and holds so much stuff! I put some of my flashier, eye catching jewelry in the top two drawers, for visual appeal The rest are used for makeup and makeup brushes. I keep my every-day makeup in one drawer, more seldom-used stuff in a second one, and my mineral products in a third. The brushes are in their own drawer. I love that I can take out just the one drawer of makeup and the brushes for average days. I simply slide the drawers out and lay them on the bathroom counter while applying makeup. I hesitated to spend so much money for this item, but it's worth it to me. My bathroom counter looks elegant and neat, and my makeup routine is streamlined and efficient. I will be ordering another one to keep in my mountain cabin, where bathroom storage space for toiletries is limited. If you think you like this chest, you probably do! It's far better than what you see in the picture. <end>  love this case and all my daughters want it  I would have give it a 5 star if it wasn't so expensive. we had to apply for the amazon credit card in order to get a discount for a price I could live with.great quality and fits all my baremineral products and then some. the drawers pull out smoothly. I was surprised by the weight of this case very well put together. I also thought it would take up more countrer space but since it is taller than what thougt it's a great fit <end>  This is just gorgeous on a vanity!  I've been eyeing this for awhile, but was reluctant to order it because of the price. I finally caved -- and it is absolutely beautiful!As other reviewers have said, this is a very high quality product, so it looks very elegant sitting out in your bedroom or bathroom. The acrylic is very expensive-looking, and doesn't look cheap at all.I researched this before buying it, and I had read something on-line about how acrylic is more expensive than regular plastic, and I can see why. This has a nice sparkle to it.I bought it to hold my hair accessories and some makeup, and it looks lovely! It's a definite splurge, but it holds a lot and looks lovely doing so! <end>  Nice, clean chest to store makeup and/or jewelry  I was looking for a piece of furniture/chest to store my jewelry, and came across this instead. It has a attractive, clean look to it and displays the items inside in a nice way. I thought it was a bit spendy for acrylic (hence not giving 5 stars), but it does the job and my jewelry is much more organized now. I'm considering getting another for my cosmetics. <end>  Fabulous!!!  love love love this organizer! I saw something similar to this on the Kardashians and became obsessed with finding one. Most of the organizers available on the internet were way over priced. So lucky to have found this on Amazon. Neatly holds all of my makeup and brushes. Very well made. Sturdy and beautiful. I would definately recommend this product for those of you searching for a cosmetic case similar to the Kardashians. <end>  Great product!  After much hesitation I ordered this jewelry chest. Very happy I ordered it. Fits all my jewelry and because it's clear I can see exactly what I have. Item is very sturdy and made well. Not cheap or flimsy. You won't regret buying it. <end>  LOVE IT!  I absolutley love this chest! I am so glad that I bought this, it was worth every penny! It looks so elegant and pretty on my dresser! A classy little chest to hold all of your favorite accessories! <end>  perfect  The chest is perfect for storing and sorting jewlry. It is very sturdy and attractive. The only problem I have had with it is some of my bracelets do not fit. <end>  7 Drawer Acrylic Chest  This item is close to perfect. The drawer liners protect your jewelry beautifully and the size is generous. Only thing missing is a ring liner. <end>  Dimensions Question  What are the dimensions of this organizer? Can the drawer hold eye glasses for storage? Need the height, width, depth etc.... <end>  Very Pleased  I's durable, and for my 88 year old mother, it helps her see her jewelry so much better. she says her &#34;dresser looks brighter&#34;. <end>  My Picks that will give you a better FIND!  My Picks that will give you a better FIND! I love this item. My deluxe jewelry chest is perfect for all my jewelry! <end>  Great organizer fpr makeup  This chest is very similar to another product that was recommended by a friend to organize my makeup. I'm really glad that I got this one. It fits in a compact space but is roomy enough to hold all my makeup that I use everyday (eye shadows, liners, etc.). It's easy to see inside and my sink top is so much neater! I also like the quality of the material and the fact that it has the fabric on the bottom of the drawer.The only thing to be careful of? Since it's designed for jewelry the drawers pop right out, so you have to be careful pulling them out. <end>  Amazing  Perfect for holding earrings. Sturdy and beautiful. This is a great solution to someone who has lots of jewlery and needs a place just for earrings. The drawers are not very tall, so other larger pieces would not work as well. <end>  Great for make-up storage  I just finished organizing my make-up and almost everything fit, except for a few larger foundation bottles. The drawers are not too deep but there is still so much space available that I was able to pretty much end up with a drawer for each type of make-up area (foundation, blush, concealers, eye shadows, eye liners, mascaras, and lip liners). The item arrived in perfect condition and the quality is great. The acrylic makes it really blend into any type of vanity and the black liners in the drawers are removable. I highly recommend this product! <end>  Shallow drawers with no backstop  This chest is well made and arrived in perfect condition. Shallow clear drawers hold a single layer of small items, which I keep in tiny clear plastic bags to prevent tarnish. I like to spend time wearing my jewelry, not polishing it. The drawers are a little too short so when they are fully closed they are slightly recessed in the cabinet. Doesn't affect function, but does affect aesthetics a little. <end>  Versatile storage unit  I just purchased this item and although I'm not happy to see the price has dropped $30, I am very happy with the product. It is sturdy and well made high quality acrylic. It stores a variety of items and is pretty on a vanity or dresser. I use it for makeup storage and a smaller 6-drawer for costume jewelry. A lot of people say this is the unit Kim K uses, but I think she has a similar but larger storage unit that retails around $300-$400. Be aware that the drawers are very shallow in this one and won't hold large palettes. It's great for single eye shadows and blushes. There are more and less expensive alternatives out there if you search hard enough. <end>  love it!  I LOVE THIS THING!!!! It looks clean, holds all my Bare Minerals makeup, the black inserts in each drawer are easy to clean (I thought they would be a velvet-type material, but they arent), and it actually has a lot more space than I expected. I thought I had a lot of make-up, but now I just want more to fill this thing up with!!! <end>  Awesome Organizer!  I know this product was made to hold jewelry, but it makes the best makeup organizer! I used to have a large makeup organizer that took up half my bathroom counter. This acrylic organizer takes up very little room, yet it holds a ton of makeup, and I have a lot! This is by far one of the best organizers I've ever purchased! <end>  Hard to find thanks to Kim Kardashian  Kim Kardashian uses this brand and type of container for her makeup. Three second shot of it in a recent "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" episode rendered the company out of stock in a swift amount of time. And then there's been price gouging on sites.That being said. This is a fine piece of work if you can get your hands on it. Great for makeup storage. Deep enough and drawers slide effortlessly. <end>  Disappointed  I was very disappointed with this Chest the drawer's when I open them they come out completely and it is very very small I was not able to use it as a cosmetic organizer. <end>  Great for Jewelry and Make up  This Acrylic Deluxe 7-Drawer Jewelry Chest is great for both Jewelry and Makeup! I was looking for something similar to what the Kardashian's use to store their makeup and found it in this product. I shopped at different websites and found a range of quality and prices (PRICES RANGED FROM $350-$200). I bought this on Amazon for $80 and because I am a Prime member I did not have to pay for shipping and received it in 2 days. This is a great Bang for your Buck item. It looks and it is high quality, pretty and it is easy to keep clean. I lined the drawers with cut paper towels and saved the black foam like inserts (I thought the paper towels would be easier to replace and keep a clean look). It stores most of my make up neatly and it is easy to keep organized. The drawers are crystal clear and slide easily. I pull each one out, one by one, while applying make up. I have a foundation, eye make up, lip, brush drawer and so on. I like that the drawers pull out entirely because it makes it easier to clean and use everything inside that drawer. I love this item so much that I am going to buy one for my jewelry too. The only things that did not fit in the drawer were my eye lash curler and my elf high definition loose powder. I love this chest and it looks great in my bathroom and I would recommend this to anyone for makeup or Jewelry storage! <end>  Fantastic!  I had read the reviews and decided to go for it, I was wondering if buying a "jewelry" case was the way to go, I couldn't be more pleased. Not only did all my cosmetics fit ( some need to be placed on their side) it's great to be able to see what you need at a glance. The clear drawers are so functional and very easy to clean, the only thing that would make this better would be if the drawers had stoppers, because I have mine on the floor I have to make sure I tilt it back as I lift it to the counter, really no big problem, other than that I would say to you go ahead and purchase it, you will be pleased........ <end>  Perfect for my makeup storage!  I have a small dresser that sits beside my vanity with my makeup in it. The loose pigment/mineral shadows/glitters were getting out of hand (it's an obsession!!) and I needed a new solution but was limited by the small size of this dresser. It's more like a tiny nightstand with 6 small drawers. This chest fits perfectly on top and even my tallest 1" pigment containers fit in the drawers. I love that I can see what is in the drawers and have easy access. It is solidly built and not made of cheap plastic. I love it so much I may order a second one soon! Great value for the price. <end>  Great for makeup organizer  I use this organizer for my makeup. I just removed the black foam liners from all but one drawer (for tweezers, etc...). This chest looks beautiful on my vanity table and holds all but my largest makeup containers. I'm not sure I would pay the much higher price they are charging now though. Otherwise I would highly recommend it. <end>  Love It!!!  Must get, total organization that looks cool!! You will know exactly what you have in each drawer..I had fun putting my makeup in each compartment..I also found a lot of makeup I diidn't remember I had.. <end>  Love item  Love this item! My only complaint is that its pretty heavy for such a small jewelry box, but this might be a plus for others. The reason why I would like something lighter is because I have ordered about 5 more of these to hold all of my jeweler. When you think of the weight of them, you have to become creative on storing these little things.Also, I was hoping the black film at the bottom of each drawer were suede or some type of microfiber. Especially, for $90+. <end>  Good Item  I bought this for my girlfriend for her makeup and it worked out perfectly. All of her makeup is now organized and not a mess. <end>  Beautiful unit for displaying jewelry  I have been given most of my mother's beautiful jewelry.I loved looking at it sparkle and shimmer laid out on my dressing room table. However, it needed a more appropriate way to be stored. After searching through many different options I chose this acrylic 7 drawer unit. I love the way it looks on my table. However, I didn't pay as much as I've seen it advertised so take care to check out the price from different vendors. <end>  Quality Product  I really like this jewelry chest. The ability to see the stored items (acrylic) enables me to open the right drawer for the item I want. Well constructed and functional in addition to being a beautiful accessory piece to a dresser or shelf. I recommend this product highly. <end>  Very nice!  Very nice product. I'll recommend to others buyers. It looks very fancy in my drawer. I was able to organize my accesories. <end>  Convenient and sturdy  The jewelry chest arrived in perfect condition and quickly. It is a sturdy item which allows you to see what you have. Unfortunately it does not hold all my jewelry and I am returning it. I thought about buying several, but decided that I wanted everything in one place. I did like it though. <end>  awesome  I bought this as a gift for my mother for her make up and she absolutely LOVES IT! Its so elegant and stylish and fits make up perfectly. Very happy with it <end>  OMG!  If you own tons of MAC makeup. This is for you! its worth every dollar. well-made, very cute and perfect for organizing everything. Its useful for jewelry and makeup. I recently purchased two more for my sister and friend. I had other make-up organizer however this is the BEST! good luck, I wish every girl could own one. <end>  BEST JEWELRY CHEST EVER!!!  I absolutely LOVE this chest and will NEVER use a traditional jewelry box again! I got so tired of opening boxes, lifting up trays, etc, in search of what to wear. With this item, I am organized with all the roomy drawers and can see at a glance where I've stored my pendants, bracelets, etc.Was concerned that it might look cheap, but it looks like glass and is most attractive! Drawers are sturdy and can easily be removed. I shopped for hours online looking at acrylic organizers, checking prices/dimensions/reviews and this one here is the bomb so I bought 2. BEST $ I EVER SPENT ON A JEWELRY BOX/CHEST/ORGANIZER!!! <end>  Acrylic deluxe 7 drawer jewelry chest ( clear)  I like the product. Very pretty and neat. Well packed and delivered in time. Quality of product is good. Though it is a bit expensive. Overall, I think is a nice piece of product and will recommend people to buy. <end>  Amazing  I absolutely love this item! It looks so elegant and amazing in my bathroom. My makeup looks amazing in there! I will order another one just because I have sssoooo much makeup  ) <end>  Love it!  A great organizer! Fits my M.A.C. eyeshadow pots, powders and blushes. Love it so much I had to buy a second. Well worth the price tag. Very sturdy. Lined with velvet. Easy to clean. <end>  NICER IN PERSON  I was VERY pleased with the way this looked when I opened it up. It looks VERY expensive and the design is very nice. It looks great on the bathroom counter. I wish it came in a much larger size for makeup! <end>  Perfect for Make-up  It's just hte perfect size. All my make-up fits perfectly. Love it keeps everything well organized. 7 I always get compliments on it. Everyone wants one after seeing mine. It's a must have.  ) <end>  Best jewelry box I've ever had!  I've had armoire and counter top jewelry boxes that I never liked. This one is great. The drawers are lined, slide easily and pull out completely to sit on the counter if you want. The best part is that you can see what's in the drawers so you don't have to remember where you put a specific piece. I liked the one I bought so much that I bought another one! <end>  Love It  I love this product. I have it in my bathroom and use it for all of my makeup. Great way to organize your makeup and see what you have. Ladies time to throw out the Caboodle and upgrade your life with this little gem! Enjoy! <end>  I love this!  I am very pleased with this case! I am able to fit all of my makeup brushes & makeup essentials. My MAC large eyeshadow pallet & eyeliner pot even fit wonderfully! The only complaint I have is, within 24 hours of purchasing this item it dropped down another $10 in price - which doesn't seem like much, but it stung none the less. I've already recommended it to several of my friends! <end>  LOVE!!  I usually don't do reviews BUT I'll make an exception for this great product!! I love that it fits all of my make up. (Minus palettes but that's understandable.) I know that there's other products like this..like the Muji Acrylic drawers...but the Muji Acrylic drawers do not fit stuff like..ID Bare minerals or even any MAC powders..but this one fits all of those things. It's amazing and I recommend it to everyone to use as a make up storage! <end>  Perfect for Make-up Storage Too  I purchased this chest for my make-up and it works perfectly. It holds all pencils, mascaras, eye shadows (individual pots and palettes), and face products in compacts. It can hold all brushes except the extremely fat, kabuki-type. I can see exactly what I'm looking for and like that the drawers are completely removable if I want to work with a number of items in one drawer. Although the product is more expensive than those (frankly, ugly) plastic drawer organizers, this one is much prettier on my vanity. Solid, well-made and the drawers move easily. <end>  Was put off by the Kardashian plug but really happy with product  It's interesting that the chest is not shown from different angles because from the back, you see everything so clearly. From the front, the pretty inset of the drawers makes the contents a little less obvious but you'll quickly remember what items you have in each drawer by placing pieces in the front. Unusual flexibility in being able to remove any or all of the black cushiony inserts. You can see down into more drawers if you remove some but they add clarity if you use them. Eye-level or a little lower provides the best view of all contents. I love how compact and shallow the drawers are. I have several other clear plastic drawers for jewelry but they're so deep, it's a jumble in there unless you waste a lot of space. With 7 drawers you can fit all but the most chunky necklaces. Best jewelry box design and material I've seen. Highly recommend. <end>  MAC ADDICT  I am IN LOVE with this... although I did not use it as a jewerly chest, it is amazing for all my MAC make-up... it fits everything even my pro pallet that I had made. It reminds me of the one that the Kardashians had in one of their episodes. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Ill post pics later. WOW <end>  jewelry organizer  I love this product, especially the fact that I can see where my pieces at a glance. It also looks great on my dresser. Even friends and family have commented how nice it looks. It holds a great deal of jewelry and is very easy to use (the drawers work just fine). The piece is heavy enough to be quite sturdy, especially with opening and closing the drawers. I am very happy with the purchase. <end>  LOVE IT!  Okay ladies if u have been looking for an acrylic makeup storage chest look no further. This one is well built and doesn't look cheap at all. It fits my MAC eyeshadows, paint pots and much more. I'm gonna posts pics because they will show just what this chest can hold. <end>  Perfect for cosmetics  This acrylic chest is very well made and heavy duty. I use it to store my growing collection of cosmetics. It would match any decor. I may buy another one if and when the price goes down - it went up from $72 with $10 shipping to $98 with free shipping right after I ordered it. But I've never found anything I liked better for storing cosmetics. <end>  Great for displaying small minerals  My husband collects mineral specimens. Many of them are flat or small or of interest because of where they came from not because of their looks. He kept these in a box in the closet and was frustrated because he couldn't easily examine them. This display case solves that problem. They are kept neat, clean, and easily accessible. It's not perfect because it doesn't have it's own light, but display cases that do are quite expensive. We have it under an overhead light and he is very happy with it. My son uses a smaller one to store his sea glass collection. <end>  Christmas Gift---BOMB.COM Worth every penny!  I recieved this from my Mother on Christmas and I love it. I originally was going to put all my makeup in it but after getting a jewelry box that is over loaded I used this to put all my earrings in. It fits so much, I have about 10-12 pair of earrings in each drawer. The drawers come completely out and it looks really fancy sitting on my dresser. I have already gotten a ton of compliments and plan to get another soon. Very good buy and totally worth the money! <end>  Loving It!  I try to keep my life clutter free and a this clear storage is a winner. I bought it for my jewelry and I use it without the black felt inserts so I can see all my stuff clearly. Its always a joy for me to walk into my closet and see this lovely storage, its functional and decorative. I cannot say enough nice things about this chest. Would love to buy one for my cousin but not at this price. Would give it 10 stars if I could. <end>  Ok but not worth all the hype  This chest is decent and sturdy but is overpriced for what you get. The price has increased significantly since I purchased it, and I thought I was paying a lot. I've since learned that this chest evidently was hawked by the Kardashians (*eyes rolling*) and therefore the price gouging ensued.I used this as a makeup organizer. The organizer I wanted originally wasn't available so I got this instead. It did the job but that's about it. It will hold a variety of items, as long as they are not tall (such as loose powder containers or foundation in a jar). I currently have it stored in a cabinet to hold my extra palettes and misc makeup I don't use very often. I've since purchased a dark solid wood organizer that is less expensive, holds my skincare and much of my makeup collection and looks more attractive with my particular bathroom decor than this chest. I've thought about using this one for jewelry as intended, but I feel like without divided compartments things may get tangled together. So, under the counter it stays for now. <end>
 B000I8J4RE  19mm Synthetic Moonstone Gemstone 6 to 7 inch Adjustable Unisex Strechable Bracelet ||	  Genuine when purchased now synthetic  when I purchased this item it was listed as genuine moonstone now it is listed as synthetic???????? <end>  Too big!  Its made with beautiful moonstones, although some are more translucent than others. And its stretchable, but its soo big that you'd never need to stretch it out. It won't fit on a wrist of regular width. <end>
 B000I9AFCQ  Vintage-Style Costume Stretch Bracelet with Synthetic Pearls and a Crystal Edged Cameo ||	  looks very cheap!!!  I know that this is a very inexpensive bracelet so I guess I took a chance when buying it. I was unhaapy with the purchase, it just looks so cheap. When you look close at it, you can tell it was not put together well. I would not recommend this at all. Not even worth the money. <end>
 B000IB4FHK  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Emerald Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia with 1mm Cubic Zirconia Polish Finish Rhodium Plated 12mm Mens Band Ring Size 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 ||	  Don't order it from this seller.  I order this ring size 9 the one I received was size 11! I already paid $5 for shipping it to my mailbox in the states then it was shipped to me in the Middle East for $8 so it isn't worth returning it back because ill have to pay for the shipping from the Middle East to the seller. <end>  I second the last and only review.  I was not happy with the item, sent me the wrong size even. I sent it back for refund, they sent the wrong size again. Now refusing to give my money back after I have spent more sending it back then it's worth. <end>
 B000IBFTWA  Sterling Silver Boy December Birthstone Necklace with Rolo Chain ||	  Stone color was wrong  The stone color was wrong for December. The picture shows the correct color, which is light blue topaz. I recieved a dark blue saffire stone. I returned the item. Silverbin customer services was good, but said stone I recieved was the only color they had for December. <end>
 B000IBFU7E  Sterling Silver Peridot Colored CZ August Birthstone Pendant with Snake Chain ||	  beautiful but small  I was looking for a peridot ring pendant to add to my moms neclace. She has a birthstone ring for her first grandchild so I was trying to get another for her 2nd grandchild. I could not find this ring at any local jeweler. I thought I found the same ring online. It looked identical to the one she already has except for a different stone. But it was almost half the size. My fault for not comparing their sizes. I needed one about a half inch diameter. This one is about 1/4 inch diameter. It is beutiful but small. <end>

I look forward to buying the rest of my choices. <end>
 B000IBUVAU  Genuine Mother of Pearl Ring Sterling Silver Unisex ||	  great quality greatly priced  I had been looking in department stores and online for probably two months before I found this ring on amazon. It was unlike anything I had seen and unlike any of the other rings styles I was looking at but I fell in love. When I got it was even more amazed, it is a georgous ring. Great quality and it will be a great gift, I am going to have a message engraved on the inside of the ring just to personalize it a little more. <end>

 B000IBVZJ6  Trillion Cut Citrine Ring Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  seems like its not real sterling silver  this ring is very pretty, fit and sizing was excellent, shipping speed was great, however, after a few weeks of wearing, the metal has a grainy texture and is turning dull. it appears that it is not real silver. i am also allergic to many other metals besides silver and i cannot wear the ring because my finger breaks out in hives. maybe the silver coat is wearing off? i am disappointed in the product and wish i would have invested in a more quality ring. <end>
 B000IBVZNM  Round Cut Amethyst Ring Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  beautifu work  beautifully done, but for American fingers, gem was a bit small. The box that it came in was adorable. Great for a gift. <end>  stunning  Delivery was faster then expected. Looks exactly like the picture, actually even better. The gem was really big. A really nice addition to the jewllery box <end>
 B000IBW09A  Heart Cut Peridot Citrine Ring Sterling Silver ||	  SS ring  This ring is very cheap quality. It says it is .925 SS, but after wearing it for just a week, the "silver" began to turn. The stones also beagan to get milky. I do not work around chemicals or anything, so I can only assess that the materials used are not genuine. <end>
 B000IBXFA8  Pear Cut Peridot Drop Earrings Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Birthstone earrings for my daughter.

I like that Peora only makes one of each ring. <end>
 B000IBXQMA  Oval Cut Simulated Tanzanite Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Deep blue color  Love this simulated tanzanite ring. The s/s setting is simple and shows off the deep blue almost sapphire like stone. This is the 3rd different simulated tanzanite ring I've ordered and although the color has less of the ultra violet tones then the real thing, the blue color is so lovely and the metal quality so nice it more than compensates. Also, very comfortable. <end>
 B000IBXRGU  Men's Round Cut White Cz Surgical Steel Ring Band Size 13 ||	  Very nice  The ring is beautiful, my husband loves it. It arrived in record time (even though I live in Canada) There were no hidden costs (unlike another company I have ordered from) The ring is very sturdy!!

 B000IBZP4C  Unisex Oxidized Spinner Ring Band Sterling Silver ||	  Good Quality--Great Gift!  I purchased this ring as a graduation present for my boyfriend, and he loves it! The spinning function works great with minimal sticking. He has fun spinning it all the time. The worksmanship is very nice, and it looks like a quality piece of jewelry. If you are looking for a ring that is still nice without being too expensive or too much like an engagement ring, this is the perfect one. <end>
 B000IBZQOG  Heart Cut Amethyst Ring Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Size 8 ||	  Very pretty!  Looks just like the picture to me, if not better. I've only been wearing it for a few days, though, so I can't say anything to its durability. <end>

 B000ICJD1W  19mm Goldstone Gemstone 6 to 7 inch Adjustable Unisex Strechable Bracelet ||	  unique design, beautiful stone  I love goldstone, it's understated while still being elegant and just plain beautiful. This bracelet combines the beauty of the stone with a design I have not seen before in a bracelet of this type. I will enjoy wearing this! <end>  gorgeours goldstone bracelet  love this design. I have had this kind of bracelet in blue goldstone and turquoise since 2007, and I wanted one in red goldstone as well, really bad only I could not find one until 2011. so I have been looking for quite some time for this bracelet. thank you GemAve. for having this item and at a reasonable price too. I am really happy with this purchase. <end>  beautiful  Got this as a gift for a girlfriend who had never seen goldstone, and was a redhead with green eyes and fair skin. Perfect match! <end>
 B000ICZIAW  Sterling Silver Filigree Heart Pendant, 18" ||	  Great Gift  Got this for my girlfriend, she loves it. As she said it is perfect and just the right size to wear everyday.  ) <end>  Very nice  very small would have been better if it was BIGGER, but I still liked it vert pretty and cute for the price <end>  Great pendant...Chain not so good  This is a fantastic little pendant, but the chain is worthless. I had to get another chain for it. I do with it was a little bit larger, but it will do. Looks fantastic on. I would recommend it specially for a teenager or younger person b/c of its size. <end>  VERY SWEET  THE NECKLACE WAS VERY SWEET, BUT THE CHAIN WAS SHORT. I ORDERED IT FOR A GIFT FOR A YOUNG GIRL, AND I THINK IT WILL BE PERFECT FOR THAT. I WAS VERY HAPPY OVER ALL. IT IS NOT THE SELLER'S FAULT THAT I HAVE TOO MANY CHINS. HA HA I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO OTHERS. THE NECKLACE WAS VERY SWEET AND I WAS HAPPY WITH IT. THANKS. <end>  beautiful  got this for my mother in law for christmas. she wears it all the time. it looks a lot like "brighton" type jewlery. it is smaller than i expected, but i like it. <end>  My wife loves it!  The pendant is nice my wife is very happy with it. We got the order quick. The only thing that was missing was the gift note other wise I would of gave 5 stars. <end>  Nice  Love the pendant, but not the chain. This is one of three necklaces I ordered on here. All three came with thin chains and sub-standard clasps. But I bought this for the pendant, so over all, I am happy with my choice. <end>  Silver Heart  My fiancee loves it. I couldn't ask for more... except maybe a sturdier necklace. She hasn't brought it up though. <end>  Pretty and elegant  Very pretty necklace that looks great with the matching earrings (although it's unfortunate that at the time of this review, the earrings are unavailable). The price is right, too. But be aware, as another reviewer mentioned, that the photo shows the pendant as larger than it actually is. If you like elegant sterling silver jewelry at a great price, you can't go wrong with this necklace. <end>  Sterling Silver Filigree Heart Pendant, 18"  GREAT NECKLACE!! i got this for my girlfriend on our 6 month anaversary and it worked like a charm. she loved it. its a perfect size, not too big but still noticeable. she wears it about everyday now. clasp in the back seems to be of good quality. very good cheaper necklace, great for those looking for great jewerly without the expensive price. highly recommenced! <end>  Nice, but apears bigger on the picture  The pendent is really nice, however it is .5 - .75 of an inch, for some reason it looked bigger to me on the picture. The chain defiantly needs to be replaced. I strongly recommend getting the earnings that match this pendent as they make this set complete. <end>  Very nice  Bought for my wife, was impressed with the quality and finish of it. Its alot brighter in person,looks more silver than in the photo.earrings looks just a good got the set. <end>  Jackpot Heart  What a great deal on a beautiful sterling sliver necklace. Picture is accurate and will make a great gift with the matching earrings. <end>  Lovely  The chain is thin, like it is on every necklace from the amazon collection, but the pendant itself is wonderful. I purchased the matching earrings and am so pleased with the set. It is very flattering and elegant and personally I like how lightweight the chain is. <end>  Great quality, looked great, wife loved it  Very pretty, hangs good. Comes with a thin chain, but the loop is big enough if you want to use your own, thicker chain.I strongly recommend also getting the complementarySterling Silver Open Filigree Heart Dangle Earrings. Together, these make a great set!Gave both the pendant and earrings to my wife, who loved them. <end>  Sterling Silver Filigree Heart Pendant 18"  The heart pendant itself is very pretty. The chain, however, is very thin and fragile. Could really use a more substantial chain. <end>  Lovely but quite small.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I thought it was lovely but then I like small unobtrusive jewelry. It is very delicate looking. I couldn't really tell if my daughter liked it much at all, she didn't seem smitten with it. The chain is ridiculously thin. i would recommend buying this just for the pendant and purchasing a better chain. It would even look nice on a black silk one. <end>  Disappointing  The heart was so small that no one can see the detail that is seen in the blown up picture on display. If Amazon is going to sell an item like this they should have a ruler next to the item. It is less than 1/2 inch in total height. <end>  size  The pendant is very nice...except that I thought it would be larger. The workmanship is well done. Thanks for the chance to review this purchase. <end>  Same Story  To reiterate what others have said, the pendant is beautiful and looks to be high quality. Note the listed size in the description so as not to be surprised by how small it is. It's understated but intricate and goes well with many things without being dominating. As others have noted, the chain is quite thin, but it seems sturdy and nice enough that I don't plan to replace it. Perhaps slightly expensive for what it is, but still a great buy. <end>  Not The Same As Pictured  After years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first time I've ever been so disappointed that I've had to return something.I bought this for my oldest daughter a year ago- it was just as pictured, came with a good chain and a nice velvet pouch. She just loves it and wears it every day. I ordered this for my younger daughter and it came today...it is NOT the same necklace. It's not even the same one pictured. The sides of the pendant are not filigree- it's solid and not very pretty. The chain isn't the same as pictured in the item description, either. Also, it did not come with the velvet pouch.I'm very upset that the descriptions (pendant, chain, pouch) are completely wrong. The quality also seems to be quite low compared to the first one I bought.I was looking forward to giving my youngest daughter this necklace for Valentine's Day. She wanted one just like her big sister, and I was hoping that it would be something she could keep forever. <end>  Charming  It's very simple and elegant. Sits just right, chain not to long and very easy to clean. Received many compliments already! <end>  very nice  I found the piece to be small but she loved it. That is all that matter's. I would recommend this item. <end>  Great Value  Pendant is fantastic. Chain is rather delicate, but holding up just fine. Also a big hit with the GF. Excellent value. <end>
 B000ID2KSY  By Navajo Artist  Beautiful! Sterling-silver Navajo Turquoise dangle-earrings ||	  Very happy  The earrings were just lovely and happily arrived on time. Great purchasing experience. I would recommend this to anyone. <end>  Very Nice  Bought to replace similar set that was lost. This set is very well crafted and is very similar to the set my wife bought in Arizona. <end>
 B000ID3CIG  Sterling Silver Filigree Oval Pendant, 18" ||	  My favorite necklace  I do not like flashy jewelry, so I am thoroughly pleased with this little necklace! It is small (just under an inch tall), but not too small. It is inexpensive, but it doesn't look cheap. I am very pleased with the quality. It is very versatile and I wear it often. <end>  Simply Beautiful  I received this (along with the matching earrings) for Christmas. The picture doesn't quite do it justice. The quality really appears to be great. It is really beautiful and looks like it would cost a lot more than it does! The oval shape makes it very comfortable to wear as it moves with you. It is a very nice size and is so light you barely notice it's there.Here is the link to the earrings. They must be very popular as they are frequently out of stock. But keep checking back, because they get more pretty regularly...they are so worth it!http //www.amazon.com/Sterling-Silver-Filigree-Oval-Earrings/dp/B000ID1NUA/ref=pd_sbs_jw_1 <end>  Beautiful necklace  Beautiful filagree style necklace and see the mataching earrings at link below.I got the earrings first and I love them ( they are lightweight too - I don't like heavy earrings) and then came across this necklace.Matching earringshttp //www.amazon.com/Sterling-Silver-Filigree-Oval-Earrings/dp/B000ID1NUA/ref=pd_sbs_jw_1 <end>  Nice necklace  True to what the picture displays. Fair deal and I received free shipping (~$25). Pleased with necklace. <end>  Oval pendant + earrings  I bought this item together with the earrings after reading some good reviews on amazon. My wife loved them both, and even now, a year later, she keeps telling me how nice they are every time she wears them. Brownie points for me  -) <end>  Very pretty  I gave this to my mother for Mother's Day. She loves it and gets many compliments when she wears it. The chain is just the right length and the filigree is delicate and pretty. <end>  Lovely Pendant  I was very pleased with this pendant.The filigree work is done nicely and it looks lovely on. It was great to wear at Easter time because of the pendant's egg shape. I also like that the length of chain is adjustable. <end>  a great celtic design  This is an excellent piece of jewelry for the price. My wife loves it. Very fine workmanship. Can't go wrong with this purchase. <end>  Beautiful Pendant!!  Beautiful Pendant that comes with a chain (that was tossed aside and a Thinner one replaced it)It also comes in a Velvet(feeling) bag that closes with a pull-tie string.Beautiful Pendant!! <end>  Looks like something from the Brighton Store  My wife loved this necklace...It came with a small chain, and the Oval Pendant has some size to it! This picture does not do it justice...the pendant has a silver shine to it, not a pewter finish (as in the picture). Great gift for any occasion! <end>  Great!  Love It! Just the right size and have the earrings to match! Great price! It certainly met my expectations. I know I will wear it often. <end>  B-e-a-utiful Pendant!  This necklace is beautiful! Not too big, not too small. It looks great and isn't too heavy. Great for any occasion! <end>  Pendant  although the pendant was smaller than I thought, that could definitely be from me not reading the print. anyway, it is very pretty and very detailed. I think my daughter will love it. <end>  What a pretty pendant!  I love how clean and pretty this pendant is, it is everything I expected from the picture on the web page. I would order it again! It is perfect! <end>  Looks a bit cheap  The reviews I read were positive but I was dissapointed with this item. The chain was very thin and the pendant looked a bit cheap and unsubstantial. I guess you get what you pay for (as the old adage goes). <end>  SO PRETTY!  Beautiful pendant and it looks great on sweaters and turtlenecks. The lovely filigree pattern comes with a dainty chain and the workmanship is very well done. I see no flaws and no sharp areas to stick on your clothes. Very happy with this pendant. <end>  Very pretty and just the right size  I bought this pendant to match sterling earrings I purchased at Amazon. The pendant is very nice. Some of the reviewers were not satisfied with the chain, but I found it very satisfactory. The sterling oval on the pendant is larger than that found on the earrings. Just the right size as far as I'm concerned. You can't go wrong by purchasing this pendant and the matching earrings. They are perfect together. <end>  Beautiful, quality necklace!  I've had this necklace for a couple years now, and it's held up perfectly! It hasn't tarnished in the least. I have a nickel allergy, and it doesn't bother me at all. Definitely a worthwhile purchase!Also, I bought the matching earrings for my mom, and she loves them! <end>  ITEM NOT AS PICTURED  I may return this item. The chain is not at all as pictured - no extension. The chain is also very lightweight and cheap. <end>  Exceeds expectations.  This is a lovely, sturdy little necklace. It's smaller than I expected, but this makes it all the prettier in my opinion as the filigree is even more delicate seeming. The silver is bright, and the chain is the perfect length. It's exceedingly comfortable to wear. I do believe this will be my favorite piece of jewelry for a while since it's beautiful enough to wear with something dressy or formal, and yet simple enough to be paired with casual clothing as well. <end>  Nice pendant cheap chain  The pendant is very nice and just as described. I was very disappointed with the chain. It's not as pictured, it doors not have the extension and is a very thin, cheap chain. <end>
 B000IDAUDG  Amazon.com  Prada Women&#39;s Plex Bob Pin, Rosso  Clothing ||	  PRADA PIN - "BOB"  Gorgeous pin--the plastic is thick and glossy and the colors and shape are great. The large size really makes a statement, and the pin goes very well with Bakelite jewelry. This piece of jewelry really has a sense of humor! <end>  Prada Bob  I bought 4 for gifts last C-Mas. My family loved them! (1 for myself also!) prada Bob comes with the Prada box, tissue and authenticity card. There was a mix-up with the order, so I called Amazon and they took care of it right away. Great service! Thank you Amazon! Debbie <end>
 B000IG2DEM  Vibrant yellow gold plated rectangular cufflinks with montana crystal with presentation box ||	  Vibrant Crystal  These looked pretty enough in the picture, but the color of the Montana Crystal was surprisingly vibrant, the picture did not do it justice. The presentation box was a jewlery box, nothing too exciting, but made it look good if given as a gift. Very nice quality, shipped quickly, good value. <end>
 B000IG8V02  Blackened or Gunmetal Color Gothic Victorian Style Filigree Hook Earrings with Red Crystal ||	  Exactly as pictured.  These are very nice earings. They are exactly as pictured, the red is more of a ruby than a garnet and looks stunning with the black. <end>
 B000IGN1AM  Earrings - E54 - Antique Gold Long Butterfly - Olive & Red ||	  very pretty  I love the look of these earrings.

 B000IHLQ6C  Amazon.com  Silver Rhodium Cufflink | Polished Round Cufflink  Clothing ||	  Look OK, feel like they'll break soon  I don't use them often, and they feel OK. Stood up to a couple of weddings this summer. <end>
 B000IHQ01S  14K Yellow Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1.00ctw, J-K, I2-I3) ||	  Cloudy  I was not satisfied with this product because of the quality of the diamonds and the mounting,I have returned them to the seller. <end>
 B000IHQ0PY  1.00ct TDW Diamond S-Link Tennis Bracelet in 14K Yellow Gold- (H-I , I1-I2) ||	  Brilliant and Gorgeous  I have made many purchases online, including jewelry. This bracelet was exactly what I was looking for and I was not disappointed at all. The delivery was fast and the packaging was beautiful. I will definately order from them again <end>  First Tennis Bracelet  I contemplated buying this bracelet for days before i actually made my mind up and purchased it. I am hesitant of buying jewelry online in fear that it will arrive and not look anything like the pictures depict them online. First, I ordered this while I was deployed and it got to me faster than I thought it would. The bracelet look just like the advertisement said it would but better; I couldn't have been more pleased. I love this bracelet and plan to order from Nataya in the future. Gorgeous jewelry with certificate of authenticity and awesome service. <end>
 B000IHRRKQ  14K White Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1.00ctw, J-K, I2-I3) ||	  Shallow, Cloudy, Dirty Stones  The J-K, I2-I3 description is accurate but these stones are also very shallow, allowing a great deal of light to be lost through the back, making them appear even darker and dirtier than they truly are. I would like to get my money back and save up for a better quality stone... <end>
 B000IHTUVA  14K White Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (3/4ctw, G-H, SI2-I1) ||	  Better than advertised  Certified at SI1, F color. Appraised at over 3x what I paid. Great bargain. <end>  Perfect earrings and great for the money  These earring have a very good size and the quality of the diamond is great. My wife really loved them. For the same product you could pay more than double the price I paid in Amazon. <end>  Should have ordered thru Amazon  I found these on the Amazon website. I had some questions about the item and called Netaya. Since I needed to access their(Netaya) website for the item number I ended up ordering thru their website rather than going back to Amazon. That was 11/28/06. So far the item has not been shipped but my credit card was billed on 12/1/06. Needless to say am very upset. Left a message on their machine and sent them e-mail yesterday; waiting for response. I ended up receiving the earings , not sure if after Christmas ( 2009 now); were very nice and my girlfriend ( now wife!) liked them too. <end>
 B000IHTV64  14K White Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (3/4ctw, J-K, I2-I3) ||	  Diamond Stud Earrings  I bought these earrings for my wife as a Christmas present. All I can say is she was so surprised that it made me every happy I got them.We just got married in October, and she had no idea that she would get more diamonds so soon.They where a big hit. If you want to make your wife/girlfriend happy buy her a pair.R Walker <end>  Great Buy....On Time Delivery  Purchased on the 3rd, recieved on the 7th....who needs express shipping when you get it this fast. I spoke with my wife who absolutely loved them. Meant for a Mothers day present but she got them early. She tells me the clarity on the diamonds is great and they are gorgeous. If your looking to score some brownie points with your spouse or significant other, heres the gift to get.Damon Owens <end>  Fracture Filled Diamonds  Not good quality stones and poor settings. On top of that, these are fracture filled diamonds, meaning that the jeweler used either glass or bromine to fill in cracks. This is a semi-acceptable process under the following circumstances 1) It should be noted in the description (lacking that at pre-buy time is in violation of FTC rules)2) You, the buyer, should know that if you ever have to have these fixed, exposure to a jewelers torch is rather likely to cause the glass/bromine to POP, destroying the quality of the clarity. Some jewelers gaurantee the fracture fill, meaning they will put it back, but with no guarantee, the diamonds aren't worth anything, since there is a very good chance your diamonds will turn to industrial grade at some point.3) Repeated exposure to common jewelry cleaning machines (sonic, for instance) may cause the glass/bromine to POP as well...see #2.4) With bromine instead of glass, you are likely to see a degredation of color over time. Bromine is cheaper than filling with glass.Fracture filled diamonds are not bad as long as you know what you are getting into. They make otherwise unaffordable solitaires affordable. These earings, though, are not disclosed and the settings themselves are very cheaply made. <end>  Not a good color stone for white gold.  I want to start out by saying that the price can't be beat. I checked a local jeweler and he didn't have any diamonds this size for less than $850 a pair. However, stones put in white gold settings should have better color than this because of the contrast. The yellowish tint of the diamonds is pretty obvious. I would recommend that you buy a smaller, better-color, stone rather than these. <end>  Poor Quality  14K White Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (3/4ctw, J-K, I2-I3)I received these earrings as a Christmas gift and we were really dissappointed in the quality. The diamonds were cloudy and one was, it looked like off center.I sent them back and bought from someone else. <end>  Studs  quality is great for the price it offered .. my wife liked it so much !! it shipped on time for my wedding anniversary !!! <end>  good buy  i bought these as an anniversary gift for my spouse. i hate shopping for jewelry...i just know what i want and what i want to spend and this product just happened to fit the profile. my wife was thrilled. i should mention the stones were not identical. they were both square diamonds, and probably had the same weight but they were not identical. but wearing them, who's gonna notice. considering the price i feel i got a good deal and my wife was very pleased. <end>  Ugly pieces  I got them on sale for much cheaper, but i'm still disappointed. Color is acceptable but the construction and material (even when it's white gold) feels weak. The clarity is worst than described which is in the end of clarity scale. Cut is extremely poor but there's no way to check this since only AGS lab can certify cut grade for princess cut diamonds  (i'm gonna return it and look for something more fancy, at least I in color, VS1, platinum bezel and has a good cut  )it's still a cheap pair of diamond studs but i won't dare giving this to my mom  ( <end>  JUST OK!!!  The picture is not the same quality as, I received during this transaction. My girlfriend loves them in spite of the milky looking stones. <end>  Great Seller. Just as advertised.  Great seller. Came just as advertised. It took a little longer than expected, but still within the timeframe advertised. <end>  Diamond Earrings  These earrings are amazing! she has not taken them off since she got them in the mail. Great price and excellent quality, you can pay two times the amount I paid for them in any mall store and you will get less quality and product for your money. <end>
 B000IHVPE0  14K White Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (3/8ctw, G-H, SI2-I1) ||	  too good to be true..  I guess the saying is ture, you get what you pay for. But I still think a seller should be HONEST in their description to save us the trouble of purchasing, mailing back, and waiting for a refund.These earrings should not have been described as SI2-I1. There were a few black specks in the diamonds that were VERY visable to the naked eye. Not alot of sparkle in them, but I would've kept them if they didn't have the black specks.They did provide a full refund,so i guess I can't complain too much. <end>
 B000IHVQ4Y  14K White Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (3/4ctw, H-I, I1-I2) ||	  Diamond Stud Earrings - 3/4 Carat  This product was delivered with a "broken" fastener for one of the earrings. It was so loose it was not on the earring and was in the box separately.As soon as we found that this was not acceptable, we returned to the vendor for a refund. The refund was credited to our credit card quite promptly so this part of the transaction was handled well!The product was shipped and received promptly also.V. W. WitwerSan Antonio, TX <end>
 B000II1BUC  Amazon.com  Prada Women&#39;s Plex Jim Pin, Nero  Clothing ||	  PRADA PIN  Gorgeous pin--the plastic is thick and glossy and the colors and shape are great. The large size really makes a statement, and the pin goes very well with Bakelite jewelry. <end>
 B000II33N0  Amazon.com  Miu Miu Women&#39;s Set of Four Plex Pins, Arancio  Clothing ||	  Tacky plastic buttons  They look so much better online, they are basically tacky plastic buttons.

 B000IJRZSI  14k White Gold Journey Curve Pendant (1 cttw, H-I Color, I1 Clarity) ||	  Journey review  I was extremely suprised about the quality of the pendant. The necklace has already broken (too thin) but the pendant is absolutley beautiful. <end>
 B000IK070K  14k White Gold, Round, Diamond Classic 4-Prong Pendant (1/3 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Solitaire pendant  Wasn't what I expected. Was not satisfied with this. Too small. I need to look at other sizes. <end>
 B000IK09Q2  10k Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (1/10 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  So Small you can barely SEE them  When I opened the package I first thought they'd forgot to include the merchandise. This is truly the cheesiest item i've ever purchased through Amazon and will never ever buy this sort of thing sight-unseen again. <end>  not received the stuff  where is my stuff, i still not received yetplease response my review, and make me happy to buy from amazon.com <end>  Decent but small  The earrings look nice but don't stick out much off of the ear. I thought they would be bigger but they are diamonds, right? <end>  Smaller than you think!  I got this for my wife and thought I was getting a good deal, but unfortunately these were so small I was embarrassed giving them to her and was afraid they would slip right out of her little ears. <end>  Only have my self to blame!!  Read the reviews, they are so small it's a joke. I bought them on impulse as a little something extra for my wifes christmas present. When I opened them I just had to laugh. I read the reviews and most of the people said the samething. I just gave them to her before christmas so we could share the laugh!!!!!!!!!! <end>  Picture and description very misleading  These are made for infants only... even then you have to be careful because the backing is not secured. I would not recommend this purchase for an adult who is seeking studs. <end>  Good deal for the price  I think these are nice, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. As others have noted, they are small and the color and clarity are not quite comparable to "fine jewelry", but guess what? They cost a lot less than fine jewelry. It's diamonds and gold, and even amazon can't sell precious stones for pennies on the dollar if they're perfect. I looked at a set of the SAME SIZE earrings by a big name jewelry co. and they were ON SALE for almost 3 times the price of these. If you want something perfect, these aren't for you. If you want something nice and affordable that you don't have to worry about (my wife would freak if she lost a $200 earring), they're great. <end>  Very small  Bought this as a Christmas gift but when they came they were so small I couldn't find the second ear ring in the bag. Needless to say I sent these back. <end>  CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?  I ordered these as an "extra" gift for my Mom. It would have been an embarrassment to give these to her. They are so small that they would go through the piercing hole in her ear. Very, very disappointed. I am returning for my $46.00 refund. <end>  Bling Bling  I am really enjoying my earings. They are just the right size. A little small but, that is what I wanted. My husband doesn't like jewelary but, he really likes these errings. They were also a great buy. I got them on sale for about $40 or so. I would def purchase them again. <end>  LOVE IT!  i bought this pair of earrings as a christmas present for my girlfriend and she loves it!!!! though there's a small problem... it's a little bit undersized, i thought it would be much bigger. <end>  Very good for the price!  I bought it for my niece and she loved it...It's small but beautiful!I think its the perfect gift for any woman!!! <end>  no sparkle at all  i was looking for a tiny diamond stud to put on my ear lobes, the size and fit was perfect, but i don't believe they are real diamonds. the gems are so dull, my mineral water bottle has more sparkle than it. <end>  Earrings  I like the earrings.10k Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (1/10 cttw, IJK Color, I2-I3 Clarity) <end>  Smaller than they appear  I purchased these for my wife but ended up giving them to my daughter due to the tiny size. <end>  Loved these!  I have three holes in each ear and I really needed some tiny diamond earrings for the top holes. These are wonderful! They are small, but exactly what I wanted. Such a great buy for this price! <end>  I was husband of the year anyway  Saw these on the Deal of the Day two days before Valentine's day at the bargain price of $29.95 with free overnight shipping. Couldn't pass it up. They're tiny little diamond chips, so the image is misleading (hey, you have to be realistic about your expectations... I knew that 1/10 ct tw meant that they would be small, so I don't have much sympathy for someone who thought they were getting the Hope Diamond for under $30 based on the picture), but that didn't matter... she was surprised and thrilled to get something since we usually don't exchange Valentine's Day gifts. It was the thought that counted, and it made her day. <end>  Great For Second or Third Holes  I bought these for the third piercing hole in my ear lobes. They work great for this purpose. Are they the largest, shiniest, most sparkly diamond earrings ever? No. They are small and semi-sparkly, which is what I expected for the price I paid. Are they small earrings that are made of real gold and can be left in all the time and not irritate your ear? Yes. <end>  Tiny but still sparkles!  I bought these on sale, so it was a good bargain.Yes, they're very tiny, but they do sparkle, so I'm satisfied!Real diamonds sparkle, but CZs just blind you! So it doesn't always matter when it comes to size! <end>  too small  this item is too small and the quality was not so great so i had to return it. i think this would only b good for lil kids <end>  So tiny, these earrings are nearly Invisible!  Purchased these earrings for $29.99 around Christmas during a Gold Box deal. For thirty bucks, I figured why not? Well, when the package arrived, I opened it to find a small pouch. I am not exaggerating when I say it took me five minutes to find these tiny, tiny earrings in the pouch. I had to turn the pouch inside out to find them! Even for thirty dollars, I don't feel these earrings are right for an adult. Maybe a toddler or infant. Wound up sending them back, thanks to Amazon's super return policy. <end>  Quiant little diamonds for a decent price.  I wish the diamonds were bigger (of course who wouldn't) however the price was really good and the shipping was very fast. I think my sister will be pleased with her Christmas gift. I really appreciate your service. Thanks to everyone who makes Amazon a great way to shop on-line. <end>  Disappointed  I was VERY Disappointed With this purchase. They are SO SMALL you can barely see them. They look like they should be for a nose piercing they are so tiny. <end>  A little small  While I suppose I shouldn't expect much for $30, the picture of the earrings on an ear showed that they would be bigger than what they are. They are tiny little things, though overall they look nice. I was just expecting an earring that was at least twice the size. <end>  1/10 diamond stud earring  I bought pink gold cancer ribbon earring and bought these earring in the white gold took them to my jeweler had him take the ear piece off of the pink gold earring as it was at the top of the earring, he put these in the top of pink gold ribbons.in the hole of the ribbon, they are the perfect size and beautiful. so I now have an orginal pair of earring made especially the way I wanted them. I am a cancer survior and was so pleased when I found the ribbon in the rose gold.good price and also beautiful. small but what I needed very very clear. <end>  much smaller  the earrings were much smaller than what they appeared to be on the website, other than that they were fine. <end>  Very small earrings  They were nice earrings but too small, so you must check the description very well before purchase something. <end>  Pretty good for the Price  I bought these for my girlfriend for valentines day, the price was right and she loved them. Only thing is they are very tiny and can have a small tendency to fall out of her ears. All in all a good gift for someone special, and havent had a problem with them at all. <end>  it was ok  It looked good. But again for the price i am not complaining about the size of it, but i wish there are a better way to quantify the size of it. <end>  pastey  my 10 yr old son bought this for his mom and if i had my way they would be returned,the stones look pastey and nothing like the picture <end>  Way smaller than I thought they'd be.  Hope the wife doesn't kill me! On a budget, and it seemed like these would be a nice gift from the photo, which is pretty misleading. Oh well. No going back now, it's too close to Xmas. <end>  beautiful  I thought I had left feedback earlier. I am sorry if this brought you any inconvience.The earrings were lovely!! They were packaged very well, and came in great shape.A plus is the grade for this seller  -) <end>  diamond earrings  These earrings were very small, which I expected and was fine with me. After all the price and quality was great. I love my little diamond and gold earrings. I'm thinking of purchasing another pair, I lost one in the Bathtub when the back caught on my hair & went down the drain. I was very sad. Excellent buy for the money. <end>  Good for a younger person  This product was very cloudy and much smaller then expected. I understood that it was 1/10th kt but I was still expecting the coloring to be of better quality. Just not what I wanted. This product may be better for a younger child but not good for an adult. <end>  those earings  anon timeas promised, but far warning the earing are so small it was hard for ne to hold on to them, the picture of them from the site is bogus and a real real close up <end>  Liked it  These earrings are exactly what I was looking for - for second piercings. Perfect size, good setting and enough sparkle. <end>  dissapointed  The earrings I purchased were very disappointing, because of their size. They are baby-size!You need to advertise the size of the product! <end>  VERY TINY - not worth it  The image online DEFINITELY magnifies these earrings. I've owned 1/10 ct stones before and I'd have to say I'm in the process of taking these to a jewler to have them verified. There is barely no setting to them at all. They are so tiny and so cheaply set that they could very possibly slip right through the hole in your ear if you're not careful. Were they worth the money even though it was a really good price? NO. Don't waste your money or even your time looking at these. <end>  Desepcionante por el tama&ntilde;o del articulo.  He comprado este producto recientemente y al principio pens&eacute; que estaba a buen precio pero me decepciono el tama&ntilde;o de los mismos, realmente seria bueno que en la presentaci&oacute;n pongan referencia al tama&ntilde;o pues es decepcionante, la calidad en si es buena y el articulo muy hermoso no hay que confundir, pero lo decepcionante es el tama&ntilde;o son demasiado peque&ntilde;as, las compre para un regalo a una bebe y la suerte que fue para una bebe. Solo volver&eacute; a comprar nuevamente joyas si tengo una referencia del tama&ntilde;o ya sea con una moneda u otro articulo. <end>  Too small  I guess the price should have been a clue, but these earrings are so small that they have slipped out of my ear on 2 occasions. Probably OK for child. <end>  perfect  The earrings were exactly what I wanted. They shipped quickly and arrived on time. I love them and would order again. <end>  diamond ear rings  Not sure that they are diamonds in gold. They hurt my ears,when theyre not suppost to. I cant take fake,my ears hurt unless they are gold. <end>  Bad diamonds  The diamonds look like dirty glue dots. The backings were so small, they are very hard to handle and the metal is sharp to the touch. <end>  10K White Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs  The earrings are very tiny. The diamond is barely visible, the picture is not true to size. If you are looking for an earring to wear alone, I would not recommend, otherwise they are perfect for a second earring or if you are looking for tiny. <end>  THey are great  just what I wanted I have sensitive skin and these work great for me I have a larger set and these fit my second hole just like I like and the metal does not bother my skin <end>  10 k diamond studs  the stone was sooo small, i would have been embarrassed to gift to someone. had to sent them all back. <end>  Wear them almost everyday!!  I love these earrings!! i wear them in my third hole. They are very petite like me! I will see if I can purchase another pair of diamond cut earrings just a little bit bigger, next time. <end>  Love them  I see the bad reviews, but I loved these they are the perfect size and they do sparkle. I wear them everyday. <end>  pretty  These were given to me as a gift. I think they look amazing. I would buy these myself if I didn't already own a pair. Happy to recommend. <end>  Poor choice  The diamonds ares almost micoscopic. They are so tiny that it is hard to put them on and take them off. I regret buying them.Jeanie <end>  29 bucks is a LOT of money when it comes to the earrings.  I know that 29 dollars is not a lot of money and I should have not be expecting them to look great blings,but believe me everyone, these earrings are NOT WORTHY 29 dollars.Even cubic zirconia shines more than the 2 tiny diamonds.The only thing I like about these is the size,I wanted something tiny but I was expecting some light reflection coming out of them.NO,the stones are as blurry as dirty water.These earring are overpriced and not worthy. <end>  Tiny but nice!  I went out on a limb and decided to surprise my wife with these for Valentine's day. I purchased the white gold version for her, and to my great astonishment, my wife was pleased by my jewelry choice - a first!They come in a smallish box, with a smaller felt bag - that holds the tiny earings (the picture in Amazon must be under a micron microscope!).They are tasteful, and understated, <end>  Tiny but shiny  Very small, but I knew that going in. Nice sparkle and nice setting. Exactly what I was looking for for the second piercings in my ears. <end>  Do not buy this!  I always knew I was going to get a tiny stud but hoped it would be not as bad as it is!!!I got this for my 2 year old but the stones (not worth calling them diamonds!) are so dull and smoky that it is not worth wasting your money on this.You get good 10-14kgold with cubic zircona at Claires which looks much better than this and at half the price.Anyway learnt my lesson not to buy so-called cheap diamonds online;-) <end>  Wasn't expecting much but....  I wasn't expecting much for a small dimond with I2-I3 clarity. For those of you who do not know much about dimonds, I2-I3 means there are 2-3 flaws in the dimond visible to the eye. I got these dimonds for my baby daughter. I liked the idea that they are small, but they are way to cloudy and do no sparkle at all! Returning to Amazon for a refund. <end>  Tiny doesn't even begin to describe the size of the earrings  I had read some reviews that said the earrings were going to be pretty small and having only paid about $40 I was not expecting too much. However, when I got them I was surprised just how small they were. Not only was the gemstone small but the overall setting was tiny as well. It had been my intention to use the earrings to supplement another gift, but it would be too embarrising to do so. Hopefully, I wont have any problems with Amazon's return process. Save your $40. <end>  rip off  I was very disappointed the diamond was so small I needed a magnify glass to see it. The prongs was so small they could get lost in your ear. <end>  The product image is deceiving  For only $40 I didn't expect to get something huge, but turns out this pair of earrings needs a magnifying glass to tell there is a diamond in it. They definitely don't shine or look anything like the product image, even under the macro lens of my DSLR camera. <end>  studs  These are so not worth the time. The stones are so small it makes no sense to wear them and dont' even think the thought of giving them as a gift - the receiver will be vex with you for life. LOL <end>  Very cloudy  I wanted a small pair of diamond earrings. I knew the size can be very small... but I didn't expect the stones to be this cloudy. They don't even look like diamond. Don't buy it if you are looking for some sparkles! <end>  Don't fall for false advertising  The actual studs are much smaller than what they appear to be in the pictures. Also the diamonds are poorly cut and have a milky hue with no clarity or sparkle. They look like pieces of smoked glass rather than real diamonds. <end>  Great Price!  For a set of diamond earrings, this price can't be beat. A little small, but they're still very beautiful. My girlfriend will love them <end>  oNLY ONE EARING NOT TWO!!  WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO SHIP THE OTHER EARING PLEASE!! pLEASE SHIP ANOTHER EARING AS SOON AS POSIBLE. tHIS WAS A xMAS PRESENT. <end>  Misleading to say the least  I did not think the earrings would be huge but I did expect to be able to see them with the naked eye. These are too small for even a newborn. I would not order them for anyone older than 5 days old. I think if I put these in my ears they will go through the hole in my ear. If you want more bling than these earrings just buy a stick pin and put it in your ear it will be larger than this diamond. Huge disappointment.!!!! <end>  Adorable  These earrings are adorable!! If you aren't into large earrings these are great to get. Guys it's the perfect gift to get for your girl, especially if you're stumped and don't know what to present to her. These earrings were made to make your girl sigh in amazement. <end>  Is it real diamond?  I got this box that says the jewelry was made in China, diamond is cloudy Its cheap and serve its purpose of a gift for my teen cousin; however its something I personally would never buy for myself. <end>  smart  It is very tiny,and not as shining as I suposed. However, it is diamond,right? According to the price .Much money for better thing. <end>  really...  I ordered these for my girlfriend for christmas. Me, being 17, read the description of the product and it sounded fair and in my price range. After ordering, I mistakenly read the previous reviews. A majority of them say they are small, but in no way could they have described to me how small they are! I don't even think these would look big enough on an infant let alone a teen or adult. If the diamonds diameter was at least a centimeter I would have found 50 dollars reasonable, but the stone is only at best a millimeter. BUYER BEWARE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM EVER!!! Ive bought alot of things on here and this is the only thing Ive ever regretted. I am returning this to the seller and going to a local store to find a better quality product. <end>  False Advertising!!!!!!!!  The earrings look nothing like the picture.if your getting the earring for your nose then i guess its ok. the diamond is the size of a grain of salt. If you blink youll miss them..for 43.00 no way overpriced!!!doubt there even real!!! ticked off... <end>  Description has been updated, but still misleading  When I ordered this product, the description did not contain "J-K Color" or the tables describing different sizes and clarity ratings. I was relying on the picture and the regular price of $220, which made $45 seem like a bargain.I returned this product after it arrived. These things are microscopic and extremely cloudy. There is no way you could magnify them to any extent, under any lighting, where they would look like the picture in the description. If you saw these for $220 in a retail store, you would be in Chile. <end>  My girl looks good!  Amazon sent them quickly and triple wrapped. They're good quality and they look great on my honey. ...And the price was awesome! <end>  Very small diamonds  I bought these for my daughters to wear as everyday earrings. When they arrived they were so small that we could not find them in the black velvet bag. When we did find them the backs did not fit tight so the earrings would not stay in place. I will have to return a special Christmas gift. My girls were so sad as they have always wanted real diamond earrings. I will now only purchase earrings that have a screw back in the future.p.s. these are beautiful and would look great on an infant child. <end>  I hate it  bad service and price. Very Orden and full shipped. Excelent presentation. Good work. Its very nice item. Full services and Very type. <end>  Diamond Studs  I lost my diamond stud. Although it had no sentimental value I wanted to replace it. I think if I were to purchase a diamond stud again I would move up to the next size. However, these were a great value at the price and I'm happy with the purchase. <end>  too small and cloudy to be worth anything  I agree with the review that said these earrings are overpriced and ridiculously small. The picture is very misleading. These earrings are tiny to the point of being invisible. <end>  Not worth even 5 $  Small tiny earrings.The stone should be diamonds, but I saw diamonds before, and those looks more like plastic.Very very disappointing. <end>  TINY  THE EARINGS ARE NICE WHEN YOU HAVE A MAGNIFING GLASS!!! I LOOKED AT THE PICTURED AND THOUGHT THATA WAS THE REAL SIZE... THEY ARE USEFULL IF YOU WHAT A PIERCING ON YOUR NOSE ... <end>  Only if you have several holes  Not worth $40 bucks ...brought earrings for my son for xmas you will be better off buying them for you 6 month old child and older. Will use them for trial and error for my son to see if he will be responsible to get some a little more fancy....Thanks <end>  Picture is misleading, but for the price...  The earrings shown in the picture are very clear, but I knew at the price and the specs listed they wouldn't be that nice. The earrings I received were very cloudy, true to the listed clarity and color. Don't let the picture mislead you, with diamonds you always get what you pay for! I only knock it a star because of the picture, since the item really is as described, not shown. <end>  Should have known  For the price I should have known they would be "very" small! They will be perfect for my 5 year old grand daughter though! <end>  review of earring  nothing much it a gift to lady friend and it seen like she love the earring cause she is wearing them <end>  comment  very cute but very small, the picture presented varies greatly with the original size.the earrings are like for a girl under 5 years for big size mismatch.but they are very cute and I'm still happy with the purchase. <end>  too small  i got this for my fiance for valentines day and when i recievied them they where way smaller than i expected so now out out last second shopping for v-day. not cool im very dissatified <end>  picture way bigger then actual item  these were so small they went throw the holes in my ears, returned them was the best use for the item. <end>  so pretty I love them  I really love theseAs other reviewers have noted, they are small; but what would you expect for $49.00 gold and diamonds?they are really shiny and I love wearing them, in fact I haven't taken them out since I got them. <end>  Sooo tiny  Even though the purpose of these earrings were for my 13 yr old daughter .. she asked for stud earrings, however, they are barely visible. I was very disappointed when I opened the box. Also the backing on one of the earrings bent very easily when we took them out of the packaging. <end>  10k white gold round diamond stud earrings  Can't complain about the service that, as always, was faultless - but the image of the earrings needs to clarify the actual size. The earrings are very small (approx.twice that of a pin head). I did expect them to be small for the price they were, but maybe not qite as tiny as they are. Probably still good value as they claim to be actual diamonds set in white gold. <end>  Stud Earrings  They are nice but smaller than what I expected. They could be suitable for a very young girl who is less than 10 years.I am glad that were good for my daughter.Thank you.Saeed <end>  NOT AS PICTURED  I purchased these far in advance for Christmas, and hid them for safety. Still not found. Would not have used as a gift as these were MICROSCOPIC in person. Disappointed in item <end>  Disappointed  Not what I expected, sorry that I was unable to return this item. In the future, I would not purchase earrings from Amazon. <end>  Smaller than I thought  The sparkle was beautiful, but the earrings were SO tiny that I didn't even think they were in the pouch they came in...they were supposed to be a gift and I was embarrassed to give them because they were so little... <end>  Earrings  Very small, otherwise OK.Don't know what else to say, but this thing is requiring more word, so here they are. <end>  Good for newborns  So tiny! I got them for my mom but I had to give it to my newborn niece. Cannot see the diamonds...just a little spark in the middle. So remember  "you get what you pay for" <end>  tiny diamond studs from Amazon  These are perfect for what I wanted. I needed studs to wear all the time including sleeping in. I don't even know I have them on, so comfortable. I didn't want my ears to close up for when I want to wear showy earrings.Because of the quality, I don't have to worry about them losing luster or causing irritation. <end>  Buyer Beware  One star for fast shipping, but these were pinhead sized and definitely not worth 1/2 the price. Kudos to Amazon for removing the misleading picture however I do think the add is still misrepresenting the value of the earrings. <end>  Nice but SO SMALL!  I guess it's my fault for not knowing what exactly this size looks like in real life,but in person, these are soooo small that they actually look like a nose earring or newborn earrings. I would suggest something larger if you want them to actually be seen. <end>  Diamond Stud Earring  I was not very impressed with the 10k white gold round diamond stud earring. The stem was a little long and when wearing them touch the back of my ear all the time. They were not as pretty as you showed them. <end>  diamond earrings  The earring is not as big as it appears in the picture but is good for the purpose I need which is as a second earring to compliment another earring. It would be too small for the primary earring for an adult however, would be nice for a child. I purchased them at a really good price and feel with the quality and all I received my money's worth. <end>  10k diamond  They are awfully cute. They are dainty being 1/10 of karat but lightweight compared to my 1/5 of a kart which is 3 times larger. They beautiful as light weight earring for everyday that you want to be a little dressy and not a lot of weight that could rip the piercing larger. <end>  A Christmas gift  My GF has 11 holes in her ears, so I bought x3 sets of these for her at Christmas to cover just over half. She was very happy with them, and I got them on sale for about $35 a pair, so I was ecstatic!! <end>  quick to ship  Picture and product differed in what I expected. I gave them to a friend who had a baby and they were jsut the right size for a 2 month old. <end>  ABSOLUTELY AWFUL  These earrings are NOT WORTH the price. They are so tiny there is no shine or reflection. Smaller than a nose ring. And, the packaging was DISGRACEFUL. <end>  exchange for a larger size.  This was to be a gift for my mother. After receiving them I thought I would exchange for a larger size. I had a hard time with returning item as I did not take computer receipts, and the girl did not know how to return an online purchase. I was going to buy a 1/2 ct. but the price on the earrings was missed marked. <end>  returned these YELLOW diamonds.  No sparkle. Buying these was a HUGE waste of time. I tried cleaning them & they were still dull. Bait & switch. The pics look beautiful and I was sent garbage. <end>  really sparkle  Bought for my sister for her anniversary. These diamonds really sparkle and made her very happy. Definitely worth the upgrade over the lower quality diamonds. Also, they appraised for much higher than purchased for. <end>  These match the description PERFECTLY.  Yes, these diamond studs are small...but if you have paid attention, you'll notice that they are 1/10th of a carat total weight. They are supposed to be small. If you want something tiny for a second hole, these are perfect. If you are looking for a show stopper, you probably need to try something with a larger total carat weight. <end>  price change  Not sure what happended but these earings have gotten very poor reviews but the price went up from 26.00 to 51.00 not the product I'm going to purchase. Bad reviews = raising the price to this company???? <end>  Items are smaller that the picture shows  Although the earrings are nice, don't be fulled by the picture the diamonds are very small, but for the price I paid should have expected them to be. The quality is what was advertised, but looking at the picture one could think they are bigger than they actually are. <end>  Smaller than I anticipated  I returned the item because they were much smaller than I anticipated. Picture is somewhat misleading. However return was simple and easy. <end>  Too small  After buying the diamond stud earring I was disappoint with the size of the earrings looking at the picture will fool you telling the truth is the answer a buyer want not to be fool <end>  Very Tiny !  I returned these as they almost slip through the whole in your ears. You could lose them very easily. <end>  Not worth the time or money.  I was not happy with these when they arrived and sent them back. The earrings were so small! The picture makes them look bigger. <end>  Great for those short of $$!  I bought these for my girlfriend because I was short on money at the time. She loves them! They are small diamonds, considering the Amazon photo is zoomed in bu 5000%, but these made the both of us happy! <end>  Earrings  I have three pierced holes in each ear. This earring is perfect for the top hole to be followed by other earrings in the other holes. I think this would be too small to use as the main earring. <end>  Was hoping for a decent earring, but...  I started looking for a pair of earrings to wear in my second hole. When I found these, I thought they would be great, they were the right price, and looked like a nice pair. However, when I received them and put them on, the backings were too loose for the post (so I had to put stoppers on the backs)and I lost both earrings within a couple of days. They also infected my ears within a day. I expected an earring that's advertised as 10k Gold to not cause an infection, but I was wrong. Buyer beware! These really aren't worth the money! Find a different pair of earrings that may cost a little more. <end>  Garbage  I wasn't expecting anything special for the price, but these are completely worthless. The 4 prong setting they're in is both larger and sparklier than the stones. I was hoping to get a tiny little piece of sparkle, and instead, a grey little chunk of rock in an ugly, unpolished chunk of metal. You're much better off buying plastic than this poor excuse for the real thing. Do not let the picture fool you, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the product that will arrive. <end>  10k yellow gold round stud earings  These are the perfect size for permanent wear. I am allergic to most metal and the previous studs I've ordered were gold coated. These wear well and cause no allergic reaction. They are greatl. <end>  Better than expected  I ordered a pair of round diamond stud earring for my wife as part of a set for our anniversary. I was surprised to see the quality above what I expected with the product. Fast shipping and recieved almost a week before expected time of arrival. I will be ordering from them again in the future. <end>  Tiny earrings  Those earrings are very nice but I did not realize how tiny they are until I reveveid them. I use them every day but you can hardly notice I am wearing them. The service at Amazon was satisfactory as before. <end>  Tiny but cute  These do sparkle a little and the color was pretty acurate in the description. Not clear but not yellow either. They are pretty small so be sure the person who wears them is not the gaudy, flashy type. <end>  Little earings, big savings, and great joy  At first sight they are really small, but that makes them elegant in a delicate way for girls and younger womens, it s a great choice for a newborn or for a graduation or even for a fiance, nice earings for the price paid. <end>  Diamond Stud Earrings  They are very small , & shiny . I don't wear them , My wife does . She could write a better review . <end>  Son peque&ntilde;os, pero bonitos  Cuando los compr&eacute; pense que eran m&aacute;s grandes. Son un detalle perfecto para una reci&eacute;n nacida o ni&ntilde;as peque&ntilde;as. Se los puse a mi hija de a&ntilde;o y medio en su bautizo y le quedaron bonitos son brillantes pero insisto muy peque&ntilde;itos. De todos modos es una buena compra <end>  still hasn't shipped!  I purchased this about two and half weeks ago along with some other things. the other things have arrived, and yet this hasn't even been shipped. the estimated delivery is over two weeks, which means I will have waited over a month to receive the earrings by the time I finally get it. That is bad service. I will write another review rating the actual product when I receive it. Had I known it would take so long, I would have just paid more and went to the jewelry store down the street. <end>
 B000IK09RQ  10k Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Studs (1/10 cttw, K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  way smaller than they make it look online  Yes, i guess it's my fault, but I was disappointed to see how small these really were. I know better now and will not buy jewelry online anymore. <end>  perfect gift after all  I bought this as a gift to my mother. I was nervous because my brother bought her larger diamond earrings. He told our mother to only wear his earrings at church. I encouraged her to wear mine often. She said &#34;These are perfect for daily wearing.&#34; I am very glad I bought these. <end>  Pretty but small  They appear to be much larger in the description. Expensive for the size. Made in china And not packaged nice for giving as a gift <end>  its okay!  when i got it i was surprise its too small than i thought. but i think its okay anyways. be careful next time <end>  Earrings are way too tiny  would not recommend for someone who wants a real diamond look as they do not look like real diamonds..perhaps because they are so small. also the back broke pretty easily the first day and the diamond fell out of my ear. <end>  Swindled  The picture is deceiving. I thought they were going to be bigger but they are smaller than a pea. Probably won't be buying much jewelry from here no more. <end>  Too Small  way too small. Picture is misleading. Pretty but I think they will go right through my daughters holes in her ears. <end>  10k Yellow Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Stud Earring  I ordered two pair. They are both small, which I expected for the price. One pair is pretty. The other is milky in color. I was not very happy with that pair. I decided to keep those and give the other pair as a gift. I am a little embarrassed with the gift being so small. <end>  very nice  I purchased these for my daughter as a space filler. The only mistake I made was showing them to my other daughters. Now everyone wants them <end>  diamond earrings  There's nothing really wrong with them other than they're small my fault for not realizing that. Packaging could use some work though because both posts were bent due to someone using a necklace display instead of an earring display inside the box. <end>  I love it!  Great earring studs for my 3rd hole. i gave it 4 stars coz I was kinda expecting slightly bigger ones. <end>  Earrings  These earrings came well packed and very quickly. They are beautiful. I gave them to my granddaughter that was only 4 months old at the time. I could not have purchased anything more perfect for her.Thanks so much. <end>  Diamond stud earrings  I ordered this pair of earrings as I already had one pair, but lost one earring. I received this pair of earrings and one diamond stud was beautiful, the other was so cloudy I won't wear it. It looks nothing even remotely close to a diamond. Very disappointed. Granted they are only 1/10 cttw, but perfect size for upper ear piercings where you want to wear something delicate and subtle, but still a bit classy. This set does not fit that bill by any stretch. <end>  10k White Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Stud Earrings  I have extremely sensitive skin and can never find an earring that I can wear in my second hole that won't make my ear react to the metal. I was concerned buying these at first, but once I received them and put them in I have not had one single problem. I absolutely love them! <end>  delighted  I have purchased diamonds online before and did not have good luck. Although I was hesitant to try it again, I ordered from here. I went for a quality check with the diamonds to verify. I was delighted in the quality I received! <end>  Beautiful  This is my 3rd pair of diamond stud earrings. I am soo happy with each pair, they are beautiful, clear and sparkling, I wear them all the time, (I have 6 holes in each ear, all have diamond earrings) <end>  quality is not better  The earrings are petite and well made; pretty if you don't look too closely. The diamonds don't look like the illustration, but cloudy. I expected them to be small and certainly not perfect - however, I am disappointed that the quality is not better. <end>  small with defect  The earings were well crafted but one diamond had a defect so I returned the set. They were also much smaller than I expected (a good size for baby jewelry). <end>  kathy  what a dissponintment this earings where!, they are so small even for a baby, and i paid 62us for this tiny earings that wont even show o shine  ((( so sad. <end>  Not sure  Never purchased earrings on line however i gave it a shot and wasnt to happy, the earrings are so tiny but it will not keep me from going threw amazon. <end>  Read the description and got exactly what I wanted  I have 4 pierced holes in each of my ears and the baby diamonds I always wore were stolen when I was robbed. I have very sensitive ears and everything else I put in the 3 top holes would dig in and infect my ears.I saw these 1/10 ct. white gold earrings here for $30 and thought perfect! Sure, the quality of the diamonds isn't great, but since they were 1/10 ct. it didn't matter. They actually look a lot nicer than I expected and I never take them out!If you don't read the description, the picture is deceiving... but they actually look as nice as the picture... if you are looking for very small diamonds earrings for a child or for a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, what have you hole, read the description here. It actually is deceiving, because the quality relayed here does not do the earrings justice. <end>  READ CAREFULLY These are I3 Diamonds!  I3 is a category of diamond that in the past would only have been used for industrial diamonds. (e.g. they would be ground up and used to make saw blades) However because of the demand for cheap diamonds, I3 diamonds are now being cut and used in jewelry. This is why the prices for certain types of diamond jewelry have become incredibly cheap.Diamonds are graded as follows  FL, IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3The grading description for I3 is as follows  "I3 diamonds have large and extremely easy to see inclusions that typically impact the brilliance of the diamond, as well as having inclusions that are often likely to threaten the structure of the diamond."I am all for look over perfection, but I would think twice before buying a diamond graded below SI2, unless this is for your young daughter who might lose them somewhere... <end>  These are REALLY small  I purchased these for my wife when they appeared in the 'deal of the day' section, and did not read the description very carefully. This is definitely a case where the top down view is decieving. I expected a simple, modest, pair of earings she could wear at work.These were tiny -- really baby sized earrings. Look at the side view before purchasing, and note the size of the backing. It's a small backing, and the earrings themselves are the size of a ball point pen.As long as you are aware of the size, I didn't see anything wrong with the quality. They seemed fine. But I expect them to get lost very quickly. <end>  Diamond Studs...  The studs were cute, but a little small. I would not agree that they are the size of a pin-head or . (see the other reviews) but they are certantily not big. I returned them b/c I was too afraid of loosing one. If you are in the market for a second pair of earrings or nose ring, I think they'd be perfect. I think Amazon should be take pictures of these earrings that are "too scale" because the picture is decieving. <end>  A title for my review...  I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend. I was going to Germany to visit her, because she is studying Engineering in Berlin. The trip itself was a Christmas present, but I went ahead and got these, too, because I wanted to make it a little special. It was an important trip for me too.I specifically waited until we went to the Reichstag (I really wanted to go there) and gave them to her.At first I thought they might have been a little small. However, they were very clear and the white gold pushed them quite well. Either way I am satisfied with my purchase. My only complaint would be the that they were not shipped in a nice little box or something to present them in. They just came in a pouch. <end>  Perfect  These earrings are the perfect size for a second hole or for someone who wants just a little sparkle in their ear. Definitely look at the diamond size chart. I am very please with the product and the look of these. They also are very comfortable and secure on the ear. I wanted something small, yet pretty for my second hole. I found them.  ) <end>  Very Pretty  They are tiny but for thirty dollars what can you expect for diamonds? The princess cut shows off more of the small diamond than a round cut. I bought them for my mom for christmas for her second earlobe piercing. They add just enough sparkle to accent her main earrings. She loves them and for an earring that small, grade doesn't really matter. I would recommend these for anyone looking for a small accent earring. <end>  Exactly What I ordered/Expected  The description of these diamond earrings does not lie. They are 30 dollars- free shipping. We are all aware of diamond prices and the quality of the diamond increases the price. So given the price AND the description, they do a great job of giving you the product you ordered. I have 1/5 in my second ear piercing and the 1/10 look SLIGHTLY smaller than it. I actually think they look very similar in size. The only difference is the clarity. Obviously the I3 do look "foggy". Not clear but not awful ether. They do sparkle, but not as much as a clear cut would. This is a good earring for someone not very particular about quality. The size is modest look, like most have mentioned it is perfect for second or third piercings unless you're going for the small stone look. I highly encourage you to purchase it if you want a cheap pair of diamond earrings. Again, read the description and you will not be disappointed with the purchase. <end>  Adorable!  These were a Christmas gift for my 8 month old daughter. They are the perfect size and fit comfortably. I think they're just adorable! I like the size but you could go bigger and it would still look nice on a baby's ear. <end>  Decent piece of diamond for my baby  I purchased this diamond earring for my baby, color and size are okay for the price I paid. <end>  Great, exactly like the picture  This is the first diamond earring of mine. I like it, and it is exactly the same as the picture. <end>  super tiny  these ear rings are super tiny. they are meant like for a baby and since they are baby sized, they should probly have the back that screws on. Didn't like them because of the size and I find it a hassle to return so gonna have to give them away as a gift to someone with a baby. <end>  It's not fancy, but it's cute and matches everything!  This is actually Ben's wife  D. I provided picture up there for you guys to see how big these diamond earrings really are ( go back on where the pic. of the product's located, underneath it there's a link called "customer's pictures" or something to that nature. Personally, this is the perfect size for me. It's not overwhelming and it matches all my clothes. I wear black rimmed glasses most days, so it's not awkward looking at all. It matches casual and "dressed up" clothes - which I'm very happy about  D. For the price (29.99), it's obviously not the Hope diamond - it's more of the lower ends diamond chip kind - but's it's still beautiful in it's own modest way  D I wouldn't recommend it for infants/babies though. The backing's way too long for them. It might hurt them when they take a nap/sleep. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase. Just keep in mind that it is tiny ( about 1/4 the size of a #2 eraser head is the best way that some other reviewer has described it), but it's great for everyday wear. <end>  dee  The earings arrived as advertised,and on time. I gave as a Christmas gift. I will shop at Amazon.com again <end>  Great for second hole  I received my 1/10 ct princess cut earrings today and I love them! They are perfect for what I needed which was a small pair for my second hole.This ended up being a great deal since there was a sale when I bought them and I ended up buying a round stud set as well with these princess cut earrings for less than I would have paid for one pair of diamond earrings at the mall. <end>  Good value  These earrings were a good value, also because I got a discount.The diamond is sparkly, and I like the small size. I purchased the yellow gold. I don't like the large backings, they were uncomfortable, and I had to use smaller backings from another pair of earrings. Otherwise I recommend these, but wait until there's a 25% or more discount! <end>  Small but very good  I thought they were very small but have not taken them out as they go with everything!! <end>  Wonderful nose ring, just the right size  I have searched online as well as my local jewelry stores for a princess cut diamond that was small enough for my nose. The prices I heard for the same cttw, color and clarity was an average of $70 higher. You can't beat what you get for this price. They were perfect ! <end>  You Get What You Pay For!  I bought these earrings for my girlfriend for Christmas. I thought  hey, they're only 50 bucks, why not. When they arrived, they were just about the smallest things I have ever seen. They are barely bigger than this period---> . I guess I got what I deserve for buying diamonds off of the internet, but at least my girlfriend still loves me ;) <end>  Returned  Was not as I expected so went on line, printed return label and sent the item back UPS for a credit. <end>  valentine gift  earrings are wonderful my granddaughter will be delighted the price was great they arrived on time and the way they were shipped no one would have guessed they were earrings <end>  earrings  earrings were much smaller than I expected, however i did give them as a gift and my niece absolutely loved them. thanks <end>  Nice but....  They are the tiniest diamond earrings I've ever seen. I wore them nonstop a week and no one ever saw them. I do like them. <end>  Quality item, but lots smaller than the pic leads you to believe  There's no easier way to make one's wife cry at Christmas than by giving her diamonds. I purchased this item pretty close to Christmas, and was pleased with the speed at which it shipped. My only complaint is, although I knew the picture on the website was enlarged, the seller could do a better job of representing the actual size of the stones, as they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be. Still, I'm happy with my purchase, as was my wife. Thanks! <end>  Small but cute  I bought these for my six mo old niece.... Cute and shiny. Fast delivery, very happy with this product. One thing the picture obviously big... When u get them really small. But worth it the diamond is shiny.. So I am happy. <end>  Pitifully small, not worth the money.  I received these to give ithem as a gift, but quickly realized they were too small to even give as a gift. My secret Santa requested these ear rings.she would not have been happy. Do not buy unless you have a microscope. <end>  ehhh....  They are REALLY small, like maybe big enough for toddlers. They seem to be real though... seventeen, eighteen, ninenteen, twenty. <end>  The photo is misleading!!  The photo shows the diamonds to be about the size of the backs of the earrings. This is nowhere near the size of the earrings that showed up. They are tiny little stones. I am so disappointed. <end>  Not what they appear to be  These earrings are way too small. I expected them to be bigger since the photograph, the illusion, seemed to be an acceptable size. I am not satisfied with this product. They are nose rings, NOT Earrings. They are also frail and dainty. Unless you are smaller than 5'0 and 100 pds. then these may not suit your ears. They may suit your nose though. <end>  Sad to say...they bother my ears  (  I cannot wear cheap earrings. I started to develop an allergy to sterling silver which for years did not bother me. I decided to buy these white gold earrings and these were my first (real) gold earrings. I'm sad to say they bother my ears. Granted it takes a lot longer for the white gold earrings to start irritating them then sterling silver earrings; however, I was hoping they wouldn't bother my ears at all. My guess is that the post isn't white gold or the post is white gold and I have a problem with gold as well.  ( I have another white gold earing coming in today (from another company) and I'm hoping that doesn't bother my ears.About the earring itself. As others noted they are small. I went in knowing they were small but I was still surprised as how small they are. Let's put it this way...the earring back is bigger then the entire earring. I was afraid when I took off the back that I would pull the earring through my hole, which has happened in the past with similar size earrings. They do add a nice little flair. I wore them in my second hole. I still plan on wearing them when my flair ups go down because they are nice. You cannot tell they are a lower quality diamond with your eye because the diamond is so small. <end>  Super  Bought these for myself, however ended up giving them to my son. I didn't really need them at all, so he is getting great use out of them! <end>  nice but small  A very nice set of SMALL earrings! You get what you pay for but the picture was very deceiving.... They make them look like they are a lot bigger than they really are. Look nice and worth what i paid... <end>  Not that good  I does not expect that much for this because I bought this ar low price, but I never though it was this bad.It does not have sparkle. Better buy a cubic ziconia or swarovski if you are looking for an earing that sparkle.i <end>  get out those magnifying glasses...  The photos do not do justice to these earrings - they are so small, that you can't even feel them in the velour bag. They have to be shaken out.Sent mine back right away. <end>  Diamond Stud Earrings  They were exactly what I ordered, what I expected, and shipped on time. The wife was happy to get more diamonds, I was happy to have not spent a mortgage payment on them. <end>  Good Buy...  I was skeptical about this purchase after reading some of the reviews but the studs are nice for everyday use as I am a male that works in a semi-corporate setting; they have even been called cute. They are noticeable but not flashy and the diamonds and gold tested real. It seems like some people are expecting large flawless diamonds; never at this price. I'm not a specialist but I do own some high end jewelry this is a good buy for the price. <end>  So pretty!  Got the earings for a great price. They look nice and come in a nice pouch but wished there was a card that went in the pouch. I feel like im gonna lose them if I take them off. <end>  Diamonds are forever!  It's a very nice earring. My wife loves so much that I can't unplug it from her ear. The Best cost/benefict product. <end>  Satisfied  Very satisfied - I wanted a small diamond earring for the second hole in my ears and these are perfect. <end>  Good set of earrings  The earrings are small but what do you expect for a 1/10 ct. They are a good price though. Felt that it was a good buy. <end>  Nice but tiny  These cute dainty little studs are great as second hole earrings. They are teeny tiny, but I expected that, so I was not disappointed. I also bought a round pair and discovered that the princess cut appear alightly larger than the same carat weight in round. <end>  Exactly as expected!  After reading the reviews, I was worried that these would be tiny enough to slip through earring holes and that they'd be cloudy... Neither is true. Although these earrings are not huge, (you can see the exact size in the customer pics posted in the info) they definitely would not slip through someone's ear holes as some have stated! Great for the price and actually ordered a second pair because I love them so much! <end>
 B000IK1YTI  14k White Gold, Princess-Cut, Diamond Classic 4-Prong Solitaire Pendant (1/10 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), 18" ||	  Great Gift  She will LOVE THIS. This was a gift for my mother and she loved it. Very nice deal as well. <end>  i wish i had this diamond necklace!  i like this diamond necklace. it is really nice. if i had a diamond this would be the one! <end>  Picture is incredibly deceiving, the diamond is super tiny  There is not a whole lot to this diamond. The picture is an incredibly large-sized zoom of the diamond. The I2-I3 clarity is mediocre - this will translate into a tiny sparkle. Even for an incredibly low price, it would be best to invest in a 1/3 or 1/2 ct diamond for $200 more and save yourself the trouble of wasting $50-100 altogether. Essentially, this necklace will disappoint every expectation.If you're a guy and you want to impress your girlfriend/wife/fiancee with a simple gift to see her smile, DO NOT buy this diamond. She will open the box expecting something half-decent only to be stunned by the minute size. She will then continue to squint her eyes, bring the box closer to her face, and force a smile. You do not want the pity kiss that is to follow. This diamond is not the gift you want to give to make her day. Instead, save the cash you would spend, take her out to somewhere nice for dinner, watch a new release in the movie theaters, and give her a massage when you get back home. She'll love it infinitely more than this jewel. You might even save a couple bucks in the process.For the ladies, I would recommend saving the cash spend on this necklace to buy a larger gem necklace. For the winter holidays, Blue Topaz is very stunning and for the same price, you can get a decent 1/2-1 ct Blue Topaz necklace with a great design in 14k white gold. <end>  Very decieving.........  My son bought this necklace for his girlfriend; its their first Christmas together & he wanted to get her something nice yet not too expensive. I did a search for him, he liked this necklace & I ordered it. First, I paid for overnight with required signature ~ I got it two days later & UPS left it on my porch! There was no gift card enclosed, altho the invoice stated one had been sent. (I found on the invoice where the company had printed "Merry Christmas, Brittany" ~ guess they figured we could cut this from the invoice???) The necklace is extremely tiny & very fragile ~ Britt wore it for four hours, went to bed & woke up to find the chain had broken. (this isn't a "careless" 8 yr. old, she's 22) The pendant is VERY tiny & in my opinion not worth buying another chain to hang it on. I am very displeased with this necklace & feel the ad was extremely decieving. What you thot you were getting is not what you get! I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this necklace & I have every intention on shipping it back! <end>  Stupid Chain!  For the price the diamond is nice, but don't buy based on the picture. The actual diamond is much smaller.I'm really pissed off at how tangled the chain came. It should have been packed better. At first I didn't even think the chain came because it wasn't in the little bag, but just thrown in the box. I almost wished I hadn't bought it because I can't seem to get the chain untangled. How much pricier would the chain be if they just invested in a better method of packaging? Not much I think. <end>  This necklace is a rip-off. Dont waste your money like I did!!  Dont buy this necklace. I purchased this necklace as a gift for my ritzy grandmother from my kids thinking it would be nice, yet inexpensive...I was wrong with both. Its too tiny, I thought for sure when I saw it that there must be some kind of mistake. ANd for the price I paid, I wouldnt pay $10 for this necklace. I would have returned it if I would have gotten in it with-in 30 days, but I am overseas with my family and another family memeber shipped it over here to us. So, I am out of luck with returning it...but dont buy this, NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Amazon has definetely deceived the customer with the picture of this necklace, should be on a model to see the actual size. Lesson learned and passed on! <end>  Poor Quality  The entire jewel bit felt like plastic and the chain came tied in several knots. The chain is very fine, making it impossible to remove the knots. <end>  Tiny  ... its Tiny! Maybe I didn't read the fine print but this thing is TINY! The whole pendant is about half the size of my pinky nail. The chain, pendant, diamond, its all nice, but just be aware you're getting a very very small necklace. <end>  Good value, but the picture makes it look alot bigger.  I haven't given it to her yet, so I guess I can't tell you how good the necklace is. But it was a great deal. The picture is much bigger than the actual size. Pay attention to the dimensions. <end>  Picture Is Decieving.  My husband recently purchased this necklace for me as a First Anniversary gift. When he opened the package to give it to me his jaw dropped. He couldn't believe how incredibly small it was. I honestly wasn't too impressed with it either. (I don't even like big, extravangant jewlery. I like stuff small and simple, but this was miniscule.)The diamond pendant is comparatively the size of the kind of earring studs that are used to pierce the ears of infants. That is to say, it is about 1/4 the size of the rubber eraser on the end of my No. 2 pencil! As for the chain, it feels cheap and fragile. If someone wore this regularly, they would surely break the chain.I think this isn't even worth the time, money, or unavoidable disappointment. Go ahead and splurge for something a little bigger.The only thing worth commending Amazon on this necklace is that when it had been stolen off our doorstep, Amazon shipped us out a new one free of charge and it wasn't even Amazon's fault that UPS just left it there, (in the hall of an apartment complex, no less.) <end>  Never been so DISAPPOINTED.  WOW, i was so deceived by the picture. It was probably pictured with a a camera that zooms in as if you were looking into a microscopic lens. If I were you, I would look up a size chart before buying any jewelry online. It was my own fault that I didn't look it up.The diamond was so small that a single rice grain is probably a little larger than the diamond. And the chain that comes with it is probably the same size as a thin thread. This gift was supposed to be for my mother, but now I will give it to my baby sister since it fits more for children.I have never been so disappointed with my buys from Amazon, but I will probably not buy anymore jewelry online again. Lesson learned. <end>  tiny, not sure if it really worth buying,  yes, it looks like white gold, not sure why it is called princess-cut, unless princess-cut meant tiny. You should go for something more NOTICEABLE if it is for your serious girl friend. <end>  Super Small, Not as Pictured, Returned Mine  The diamond is extremely small and does not stand out like it does in the picture. Its appearance is similar to a necklace you get out of one of those machines with plastic eggs that have toy jewelry inside. When the necklace is worn, the diamond is barely noticeable because it is so small - it looks like you're just wearing a chain. The chain is very thin - I have never seen such a thin chain. It would be extremely helpful if the pics showed a model wearing the necklace so you could get an idea of what it really looks like. I returned this necklace because I will not be seen wearing it. <end>  Don't thnk about this.  The old addage that if it looks too good to be true it probably is applies here. When I opened the box I could not even see it at first! Whisper thin, the diamond no bigger than the head of a pin, when I lay it against my skin, it vanished. My fist reaction was "they have to be kidding". I returned it. <end>  14k White gold, princess cut, diamond classic 4 prong solitare pendant  I bought this necklace for myself. It is everything I expected.I wanted something I could wear everyday with anything. It is dainty, strong and very pretty. <end>  Super Tiny!!!  I was so disappointed when I received this necklace. What a waste of money. You need a maginfy glass just to see the diamond! DONT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!! <end>  read the carat size  the pictures are larger to enable you to see the details, you should know that when it says 1/10th of a carat it is not very big. Always read the size of the carat, unless its 1/2 carat you should know it is too small for an average womens neck, i.e. too small, and certainly the price will tell you, read all information Amazon has provided, <end>  Looks can be deceiving  This item was great! Looked bigger in picture so it wasnt what I was expecting once I opened the package. Great service, but remember. Looks can be decieving. <end>  small  The Pendant is to small... I was fooled by the picture... and when I got it I could barely see it. <end>  smaller then expected  image does more justice to the pendant then expected. Received item and laughed! granted it is a 1/10th carat, I still expected it to be prettier. I may give it to one of my nieces when they start kindergarten in 3 years! Very disappointed! <end>  diamond necklace  I bought this item and returned it with a few days. I opened the box and as soon as I saw it I knew I would return it. I never took it out of the box. It was so tiny one needed a magnifing glass to find it. It was aweful <end>  C'mon people do your research!!  Don't blame Amazon for your inadequacies! If you are buying a diamond online do your research as to what it should look like. I received this necklace as a gift and yes, it is tiny but it's nice because it's very simple and understated.Also you paid 69.99 for this necklace!!! I'm not sure why ya'll are expecting the Hope Diamond, get real. <end>  Christmas present  Bought this as a Christmas present and she loved it. When I received it , I thoughtthe diamond in the Pendant would be a little larger but it looks great <end>  All first time buyers???  Have any of you ever bought a diamond before??? Or ever seen one in person??? It says ONE-TENTH OF A CARAT and doesn't say "picture is actual size"!!! Geeeeeeeez....this product doesn't deserve 1 star reviews because you're all clueless as to how big 1/10 ctw. is. <end>  A tiny stone  I'm very dissapointed, photo is absolutely different of the product that I received or at least I was waiting for.Don't waste your money. <end>  Not enough value for the Cost , The chain is to fragile, Amazon does not recognized their return policy  This product is very bad quality. the chain is very fragile. Iif it gets tangle, good luck getting it untangle. I returned this item for this reason. I do no think that I got a good value for my money. I returned the item within the 30 days return policy. Amazon received it on the 25 of January and I have not received my refund. Even though, Amazon.com has a statement online extending holiday purchase until January 31, 2010. <end>  Very feminine  I really like this necklace. It's pretty much what I expected. Very delicate and feminine which is what I was looking for. I wanted a necklace that I could wear every day as well as in the evening to a nice dinner. I did not have a hard time with the packaging. It was not tangled at all. No knots or kinks. I suppose my only complaints would be is that the chain was not as shiny as I would like, but I think if I polish it with silver polish it will be fine. It was a little pricey for the size, but as long as it's what I was looking for I'm happy. If you want bigger spend more and get bigger, but if you like small and delicate, it's perfect. <end>  Nice but extremely small  This is a lot smaller than I expected. The quality seems ok but on the picture it looks a lot bigger. I know that the size is listed in the description, but it would really be helpful if items like this would be modeled by someone in the picture, so that you can really see what it will look like on a person and see the actual size. It is very fragile and delicate, the necklace itself is very thin. If I had known it was this small I would have selected something else. <end>  dont be ignorant  Be wise with your purchases. The ones that have left bad reviews are the ones that had no idea what they were buying. The price on this should have been the first indication as to what you are going to get. A cheap diamond is exactly that. There is a direct correlation between the price and quality of a diamond. A higher price will mean a higher quality. There should have been no surprise there, especially when they give you the details of the rock. A princess cut is a square cut diamond. A 1/10 carat diamond is small, period. J-K color means that there is noticeable color, in other words not a colorless white diamond. (A D denotes a perfect colorless diamond and the scale goes down from there) I2-I3 is the lowest clarity there is. It means Included and that there will be visible imperfections. Most of the finer jewelry stores wont even carry these diamonds. As for the gold, 24 karat is pure gold. The 18k, 14k, and 10k denotes how many parts out of 24 are pure gold. 14 karat would mean that 14 parts out of 24 is actual gold or in other words 58% is pure gold and the rest is a combination of other metals. If you know what you are purchasing before hand you will be less likely to be disappointed.I did not write this as a review of this product in any way, I was just trying to drop some knowledge. <end>  Perfect for everyday use  I absolutely love this necklace. I've worn it every single day for the last four months straight. The diamond is so clear and it really sparkles. I wear my necklace when I sleep, exercise and shower without worrying about it breaking or turning my skin green. Its great by itself or layered with other necklaces. 1/10th of a karat is very small but the diamond shines brilliantly. I have received a lot of complements on this necklace. <end>  Save yourself the headache  My husband bought this for me and sadly doesn't read reviews! If he had he never would have gotten it. Not only is it small but I never even got a chance to try it on,as it came in a giant knotted ball. I brought it to our jeweler and even he could not unknot it. Definitely pass on this one. <end>  picture is very close up  You can barely see the diamond, the setting is most of the display, bought it for my wife, sad when it got here and she opened it... this is really really tiny, and the chain is the thinest chain I've ever seen... <end>
 B000IK5S6I  14k Yellow Gold, Round, Diamond Classic 4-Prong Pendant (1/2 ct, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Great Price ... beautiful piece of jewelry  I bought this item years ago when Amazon had a special extra 50% off ... Got this piece for $200 and got lots of compliments wearing it... The stone is a good size and sparkles... However, I did not like the chain; it is a little short, like a choker. I think it broke. Definitely buy another if Amazon runs the special again  ) <end>
 B000IK5ZCU  IGI Certified 10k Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Studs (3/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Just an o.k. purchase  I bought these earrings for myself. When I got them, I was underwhelmed. Not much to them. Great purchase for a juvenile-too small for an adult. <end>  Diamond earrings  I have been wearing these earrings since i bought them two years ago. Love them! the clarity was not great but its what i could afford. <end>  Two studs were clearly two different sizes!  I know, what do you expect for diamond studs that are so inexpensive, right? Well, I expect them to look like a matched set, no matter how mediocre the quality. One earring was clearly smaller and narrower than the other--more of a rectangle than a square. I have resorted to wearing one in my second hole on one side only, because they look dumb as a pair. <end>  Good bargin  They looked just like they did in the add, I would have paid more for the same size at Waslmart and sales tax too. <end>
 B000ILDATY  IGI Certified 18k Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (1 cttw, H-I Color, SI1-SI2 Clarity) ||	  Great Earings  These are great earrings for a very good price. I checked them out with a loupe and there were two feathers under 16x magnification one in each earring. Color is good and they do come with a certificate.They look great and the 1/2 carat each size is perfect for every use.The certificate stated they were larger by about 10% in size. <end>
 B000IMIDDG  18k White Gold, Round, Diamond 4-Prong Solitaire Pendant (1/2 ct, H-I Color, SI2 Clarity) ||	  Beautiful classic, backed by Amazon's stellar service  I'm very happy with this product. The diamond looks great. The packaging was elegant as well. The pendant itself is in a simulated wood-grained box, which itself is inside of a dark blue cardboard box. Present this to your significant other, and she'll know that something good is inside! <end>
 B000IQB5FA  20 Row Multicolor Freshwater Cultured Pearl 4-5.5mm Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  You had better have a small wrist  I bought this for my wife, who is 5'7" and normal weight/bone structure. She can barely stretch it around her wrist. Not recommended for anyone with anything above an average female wrist. <end>  Must have small wrist  Beautiful bracelet, I was so hoping it would fit. Unfortunately, it is too small. Can some sort of extension be added so this can be wearable? <end>
 B000IQCETG  Freshwater Cultured Pearl and Peridot Endless Necklace (5-6mm),100" ||	  It was every bit as beautiful in real as online. Good service.  Beautiful product, great service. <end>  I returned  The necklace would not lay flat...the strand was slightly wavy instead of straight. Just truly uncomfortable. <end>
 B000ITWHW2  One Silicone Double Flared Skin Eyelet  4g, wearable length  1/4", Clear (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  Comfortable, nearly invisible!  I have tried the Kaos Softwear 6g sized skin eyelets before - these 4g ones are definitely easier to get in. The soft eyelets are a great product, they look fantastic, you can't even feel that they are there. The downside to that is you can't feel if you lose one - and the clear ones are hard to spot on the floor if they pop out. But at this price I don't mind buying extras. These clear ones are handy when wearing any porous material such as polymer clay coils - they protect the inside of your holes from becoming stuck to the jewellery. Like any non-porous jewellery they will collect gunk and need cleaning but this is fairly straight forward to do. I'll be stocking up on a few more colours! <end>
 B000ITWHYU  One Silicone Double Flared Skin Eyelet  6g, wearable length  1/4", Black (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  Don't even know they are there!!!  Just purchased 4 of the Skin Eyelets from Steel Navel in 2g, 4g and 6g. First off shipping was very prompt and all items were exactly as described.As far as the Skin Eyelets they are pretty sweet. They are so lightweight you don't even know they are there. I work in a cold storage facility and not wearing metal in my ears is really nice. The cold used to sink right in before. Another nice thing about these is they don't cause the usual foul smell that other jewelry does. They are flared just enough to hold them in. I have had three in for a week and have not had any come out when sleeping or showering.Putting them in, especially the smaller sizes was a little tricky. In fact I could not get the 6g one in until I had a brainstorm. I folded the Skin Eyelet side to side twice and put in in the non-flared end of one of my single flared tunnels leaving just enough to grip out of it. I slid the tunnel in enough to grip the Eyelet from the back and held it as I pulled the tunnel back out. The Eyelet unfolded and was in as easy as that with some slight adjustment. The bigger sizes are a little easier to get in without any kind of assistance.All in all I am happy with these. How long they will hold up is hard to tell. But for now this is all I will wear. So much more comfortable than metal. <end>
 B000IU1R40  One Silicone Double Flared Skin Eyelet  2g, wearable length  1/4", Clear (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  These will really freak people out!!!!  Just purchased 4 of the Skin Eyelets from Steel Navel in 2g, 4g and 6g. First off shipping was very prompt and all items were exactly as described.As far as the Skin Eyelets they are pretty sweet. They are so lightweight you don't even know they are there. I work in a cold storage facility and not wearing metal in my ears is really nice. The cold used to sink right in before. Another nice thing about these is they don't cause the usual foul smell that other jewelry does. They are flared just enough to hold them in. I have had three in for a week and have not had any come out when sleeping or showering.I really love this clear one. It makes it look like nothing more than an open hole. I have already had several people look at my ear and tell my I am missing a piece of jewelry. Even when I say I'm not they don't believe me until they look close and see there is a clear Eyelet in there. Mission accomplished.Putting them in, especially the smaller sizes was a little tricky. In fact I could not get the 6g one in until I had a brainstorm. I folded the Skin Eyelet side to side twice and put in in the non-flared end of one of my single flared tunnels leaving just enough to grip out of it.

The bigger sizes are a little easier to get in without any kind of assistance. In fact the 2g went in by folding it twice, putting it in the hole and letting it unfold. Popped right into place.All in all I am happy with these. How long they will hold up is hard to tell. But for now this is all I will wear. So much more comfortable than metal. <end>
 B000IWK10Y  Floral Design 925 Sterling Silver Gemstone Post Earring ||	  love them  I love my earrings. They are very unique, and look just like the pictures. If you are looking for something that no one else might have, get these earrings. They really do sparkle <end>  gorgous and classy  These earrings are absolutely gorgous and they are great for special events or to wear with a nice dress outfit. I bought them to match a necklace and braclet I had got for a christmas party. They matched perfectly and went very well with my dress also. <end>
 B000IWOVNM  Diamond Eternity Band In 14kt White Gold. Size 5 ||	  Nice ring  The ring is very pretty and just as advertised, SHE is very pleased, so am I! <end>
 B000IWZVRW  Sterling Silver Vintage Design Butterfly Necklace ||	  For Kids only!!  I bought this because I love butterfly and sterling silver jewelry. However it was more like a choker than a necklace. Would recommend for kids only. Would've loved if it had about 3 more inches in length on it. <end>  Length not as advertised  This is a very pretty necklace but it is way too long. It is 20 inches, though the ad said 16. I had to pay a jeweler an extra $20 to shorten it 4 inches. I would have preferred to return it, but my husband wanted his mother to keep it. Therefore we ended up paying an extra $20. Would not buy from them again. <end>
 B000IX9X0M  7-inch Italian Sterling Flat Bar Link Chain Bracelet ||	  sterling silver flat chain bracelet  While the sterling silver is very bright and looks well made it would not take much to break it because it is so thin. I was going to give it as a present but worried if my friend wore it once it would break. The price was good but the product was to delicate. <end>
 B000IY8CU8  Pugster Gears Stainless Steel Necklaces Pendant For Men ||	  Nobody else will have one of these  This is a pretty unique looking necklace. Despite what the product information said the two I ordered DID come with the ball chain necklace. Its slightly smaller than I expected but I actually prefer the smaller size. Its also more shiny than it looks in the picture but that's fine with me too. I am happy with my purchase, the pendant wasn't exactly cheap but it doesn't look cheap either. The ball chain necklace it comes with is about as cheap as they come, I am going to upgrade this and you may want to do the same. Keep in mind the hole for the chain is fairly small, I don't have exact measurements but beware if you plan to switch the chain out. On a side note the gears do spin freely and the writing on them is quite crisp. I think this piece will appeal to a wide range of people who are looking for something unusual. I like that it stands out but isn't so large to just jump in your face like some oversize steam punk style jewelry <end>  beautiful glass  The Murano glass is quite beautiful. I think I would prefer a different "chain" although the fabric one is satisfactory. <end>  beautiful pendant  This was a little gift for my girlfriend for no particular occassion. She really likes it and wears it very often - it's probably her favorite pendant. It looks rather elegant, which is uncommon, considering its price. Pearls in the wings reflect light not unlike butterfly scales, which adds to its appeal. <end>
 B000IZ76CC  14k White Gold, Round, Solitaire Lever Back Drop Earrings (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  DIAMOND JUBILEE  We ordered these earrings as part of the gift for my Mom's 75th Birthday. They are really very stunning, and she has been wearing them with joy and pride since receiving them.They are substantial at 1/4 karat each. They are well matched diamonds, large enough to appreciate without being gaudy. Very classy. The white gold lever back loops are of good quality and craftsmanship. They are easy for her to put on and take off, and because of the lever back she does not fear losing them.We are extremely pleased with the quality of these earrings at such a reasonable price. They helped put the diamonds in Mom's diamond jubilee. <end>

 B000IZEJSG  Silver Gold-Tone Golf Ball Club Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  cufflinks  These are great for the golf lover. My newphew was blown away by these cufflinks.They are made very well and look great. <end>  Good quality material. Attractive.  We ordered these for as a birthday gift for the golfer that has everything "golf." He's a pro and instructor. This was his first pair of golf cuff links and he likes them. They are not heavy, the metal is of good quality, and they look nice. <end>
 B000IZGCTU  Clearly Charming Gray Ribbon Diabetes, Brain Cancer Awareness Italian Charm ||	  Undersize  It was not what I expected. It was very tiny I mean small and I guess you have to buy a whole bunch in order to make them like a chain, cause I couldn't figure it out what it was about. <end>
 B000IZGHJU  Faucet Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Beautiful cuff links  We first saw these cuff links in a shop window in France. The ones we ordered from Cuff Daddy were a match, but much less expensive. They arrived as promised in a lovely presentation box. <end>  It's nice  The cufflinks are nice, yet the way that they are very well finished. A good value for money. <end>  Very Nice  Bought these for my boss as a replacement of ones I previously bought him where the stem broke off from the &#34;faucet&#34;. They arrived quickly, and I was impressed how well they looked for the price as well as the nice box they came in. My boss likes them a lot and they look very professional for his position. The seller was great to deal with and helped alot with my repurchase. I would definitely buy from them again and recommend others to purchase from them. <end>  Love these!  And they do not catch on jacket sleeves as some cufflinks do. Nice look and quality. Cute novelty. The rounded edges are nice. <end>
 B000IZGHK4  Airplane Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  My son loved them  Nice quality, exactly what we wanted! Couldn't be happier with all of the cuffs we purchased from Cuffdaddy! Footballs, air planes and basketballs  ) <end>  Great for the world traveler  I got these for my boyfriend who wears french cuff shirts often for work. He also travels a lot and I thought these were a clever gift. They look pretty sharp and the quality is nice. Sometimes with cufflinks like this they are very bulky, but these lie &#34;flat&#34; nicely and aren't too &#34;flashy&#34;. <end>
 B000IZGHOU  Rectangular Satin Waves Silver Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Nice cuff links set for the money  Nothing super special, but they look nice and the price is right. Not terribly difficult to get on and off by yourself. Overall happy with my purchase. <end>
 B000IZRDLQ  14 KT Yellow Gold 8 MM X 6 MM Mystic Fire Topaz Gemstone Leverback Drop Earrings ||	  mystic fire  The gold was beautiful and the stones were pretty also, but didn't have quite the fire I had hoped for. I got them as a gift for my mom and she loves them. She has also gotten many compliments on them <end>
 B000IZV7M2  Musical Irish Angel Jewelry Box ||	  Musical Irish Angel Jewelry Box  It's a pretty music box that I ordered for a gift, but I was a little disappointed on it's quality. It's more fragile than I had hoped and I would have looked further if I had checked a little closer. I would have gone with a painted wooden one instead. <end>
 B000IZZ2B4  Sterling Silver Platinum Plated Sapphire and Diamond-Accent Earrings ||	  Stunning  These are absolutly stunning and a great bargain too! I was very happy with the appearance of these earrings. They would complement any dressed-up occassion. <end>  loved these  bought these for my Mom. she loved them, I loved them, great value for money. <end>  Very fancy!  I think these earrings are a great deal for the price. I've had compliments on them, they feel good, and they stay put. <end>
 B000J013ES  Sterling Silver and 14k Gold Blue Topaz Ring, Size 9 ||	  It's a nice ring but doesn't look like the picture  First off, it's a light blue or light turquoise stone, not a bright blue stone like in the picture so I was kind of disappointed. Pretty, but not what you see in the image. Secondly, there is very little color contrast between the gold-toned side pieces and the rest of the ring in silver. Being that the ring is much smaller than what you see in the picture, the gold really doesn't show up much. So in essence, it looks like a silver ring, not two-tone.That being said, it's a nice ring. Well-made and pretty and true to size. I have been wearing it fairly often. <end>  Really Nice Ring  I am very pleasantly surprised by this purchase. The ring looks even better in person. It is well made and the topaz stone is a beautiful color. I highly recommend. I am planning to buy another for a friend- I am so happy with the one I purchased for myself! <end>  Big bang for your buck!  The ring is really pretty and is sized exactly as stated. You get a lot for your money when you purchase this ring. Nobody will mistake it for a David Yurman, but so what. <end>  My daughter's first birthstone ring  I am impressed with this ring. It is made very well and is solid. The stone is vibrant and is cut nice. This was a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter who also shares her birthday with Christmas. She was thrilled because not only is it pretty but it is "real". She says it is also very comfortable to wear. The stone is level with the setting and therefore does not catch on anything. <end>  So pretty!  I just received this after reading all the positive reviews, and I could not be happier! It's just so pretty, the blue is like a turquoise-water blue, it really pops out on your hand. It does sort of remind me of a David Yurman type ring with the scroll around it. I'm very happy with the quality, and for this price, you honestly cannot go wrong. <end>  Color not deep  Got this ring today. The color is NOT the deep blue shown. More of a very light blue and the cut on the stone does not show it to its best advantage. You see a large flat area at the center of the stone so there is very little "sparkle" and "fire". The setting is nice but the lack of a deep blue colored, well cut stone keeps this ring from being a 5. <end>  Nice, petite little ring  I bought this ring on sale, so for the price I paid for genuine blue topaz and sterling sliver, it is a excellent deal!!! The blue color of the stone is lighter than the picture and the gold area is small, but it's a keeper. I am very satisifed with my purchase. <end>  it's not deep blue showed in the picture. returned it, having not received refund after 40 days  it's my first return, but it went bad. No refund after 40 days. The topaz is light blue, not deep blue, very disappointed. <end>
 B000J02LBW  4g (4 Gauge) BlackLINE Flesh Tunnel Plug Earlet ||	  4g (4 Gauge) BlackLINE Flesh Tunnel Plug Earlet  I like the look of 'em, but they seem a lil pricey(remember the cost you see is PER PLUG!) <end>
 B000J03NQ4  Sterling Silver and Pink Rhodonite Open Drop Pendant, 18" ||	  Beautiful Necklace  I ordered the earrings that go w/this necklace & couldn't believe how nice they were & the quality was great, that's why I ordered the necklace, the necklace was just as nice, I would highly recommend. <end>

 B000J0FP74  Cherry Enamel Childrens Screwback Earrrings - JewelryWeb ||	  cute, but not great quality  when i first got theese earrings i was very excited. they are very cute and a perfect size for my 2 year old daughter, too bad when i took them out and got a closer look they are hollow on the back and quite filmsey. the post was bent just from removing them. i am keeping them since they are so cute on her, but had i known i would not have bought them. too pricey for being so cheap.... <end>
 B000J0GCNU  21st Birthday Gift - Twenty First Birthday Wish Bracelet ||	  Twenty First Birthday Wish Bracelet  I was extremely happy with the product. The bracelet is made out of high quality swarovski crystals with a sterling silver clasp and 21st charm. It shipped quickly and was beautifully packaged in a ribboned purple box. It also contained a 21st birthday insert card with a well written sentiment. It was perfect for this special occassion. I loved it! <end>  Beautiful and good quality.  This is a very beautiful bracelet and very good quality. Perfect gift for a young woman who's turning 21! I recommend it highly. <end>
 B000J0HPJK  Ladybug Enamel Childrens Screwback Earrrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Beautiful and Dainty  Well finished product. Great customer service if you need it. They stand behind their products. <end>  Small but cute  These earrings are tiny but very cute. I would recommend them for a baby, but am concerned with my pre-schooler. I wish there was more disclosure of their actual size. <end>  Decent  We were tryingto replicate a family handme down. It did the job, but wish they were a little cuter. <end>

 B000J1C076  Sterling Silver 34mm Hoop Earrings ||	  Versatile and stylish  I love these earrings! They're light; I can barely tell I have them on, but they look beautiful with anything from jeans to a sundress. <end>
 B000J1C0JO  14k Yellow Gold Floral Dangle Earrings ||	  a little bit twisted  My wife loved them, although I thought they were more rigid and that they looked always as the picture shown. Actually, as they are made from little chains, they twist and turn and give it a little bit of a "disarranged" look. <end>
 B000J1MOZY  Clearly Charming June Pink Alexanderite Color Girl Child Baby Birthstone Italian Charm ||	  charm  Great charm. Was very impressed with quality. Will order again from this company. I recommend this to anyone looking to buy a charm. <end>
 B000J1ORIQ  August Peridot Color Boy Child Baby Birthstone Italian Charm ||	  good, but the size was not what i thought it would be.  it was a lot smaller than i expected, but still really cool and great. i think this item was a great item and looks very pretty. <end>
 B000J2KWK2  Sterling Silver Purple CZ Ring ||	  Fabulous Ring!  This is an elegant ring with sterling band and beautiful color. The stone is like pink ice with a little purple. It's just gorgeous! What a great buy too! <end>
 B000J2KWKC  Stelring Silver Light Blue & Clear CZ Ring ||	  Sterling Silver CZ Birthstone  Very pretty ring at an affordable price.Would be happy to give as a gift-- also Silver Speck was very prompt in delivering. <end>  Gift for Niece  This was a birthday gift for my 16 YO niece. She loves the ring and was very happy to have received it. <end>  Aquamarine Ring  I loved this ring when I first saw it online and admired it for some time. Unfortunately, it was much smaller than it looked online and I was really hoping for a larger, statement type ring. I ended up having to return the ring since it didn't really stand out as I had hoped. If you however, like a smaller, more petite look, the ring is definitely very pretty. The color of the stone was very nice, clear and vibrant. I just needed something to really stand out in size and sadly this wasn't it. <end>
 B000J2KWUM  Sterling Silver Rectangle Lab Created Pink Sapphire and Simulated Diamond CZ Ring ||	  Missy  Very disappointed. I'm sending it back, band has tarnished. I don't think it's silver as described. Too bad, it's a cute ring and my daughter loved it. <end>  sterling silver pink sapphire diamond border  Sterling Silver .925 PINK SAPPHIRE border Ring Size 10This ring is very beautiful the pink sapphire is brilliant as are the diamonds the size 10 is perfect the setting is delightful. Obviously I love it looking forward to many complements as I have just received it. The price is more than reasonable <end>
 B000J2KX4W  STERLING SILVER Prong Set cz Simulated DIAMOND RING S7 ||	  Looks way expensive  This ring looks very expensive. The stones are much prettier than the picture. I have been getting a lot of compliments from people. Its my favorite piece of jewelery ... <end>
 B000J2KX7E  Sterling Silver Oval Pink Shell Oxidized Beaded Design Ring ||	  Gorgeous  I love this ring. I get many compliments on it and I wear it every day! <end>
 B000J2KXLK  Sterling Silver Turquoise stone Ring ||	  Great Ring...  I received this ring as a Christmas present and I love it. It is not too big and is nice to wear. <end>
 B000J2KXTM  DESIGNER Silver Simulated Diamond Basket Weave Ring S7 ||	  Unbelievably beautiful & realistic ring.  I didn't expect too much when purchasing this ring because sterling silver immediately turns black when I wear it. It was explained that this ring has a Rhodium coating and would keep it protected. I sleep, shower and swim & never take it off and it remais as beautiful as the day I recieved it. I wear it on my right hand and on my left I wear a real 1 carat (T.W.) channel set ring in 14 carat gold. I receive more compliments on the Sterling & CZ ring than on the real one. I have purchased other CZ rings and in time the brilliance of the stones are dulled and there is nothing that can prevent or fix it. Not so with this ring. I reccommend it to anyone that wants a stunning ring without having to pay a high price for the real thing. <end>
 B000J2KY46  GENUINE Blue Topaz Citrine 3 stone Silver Ring S5 ||	  Disappointing  This ring looks much better in the photographs than in person. Colors are dull and dirty and in less than 2 months the majority of the sliver had worn off leaving a dull and dingy band. The only decent thing I can say is that it arrived promptly. <end>
 B000J2M2XW  Sterling Silver & Oval Tiger Eye Stone Ring ||	  LOVE!  I LOVE this ring. Very pretty stone & nice quality. I am only giving it 4 stars because it looks like a more substantial size stone in the pictures, but it is a sweet very pretty ring otherwise. <end>
 B000J2M32C  Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst Bali Design Ring ||	  Sweet  This ring is sweet and bright. The stone is small, but it is nice for a child; however  the stone fell out of my daughter's ring, and I'm trying to replace it (not as easy as it looks.) I wonder if that stone falling out is a fluke, because the stone in my ring seems to be in very well. It is quite a pretty little ring. <end>  The Bali Ring  This was a Christmas gift. It is hard to imagine that a ring of this quality could be 5 bucks, but that's how much I paid for it. My sister loves the ring's antique look. She says that she never wears rings, but she'll wear this one because it is so pretty. The size range in this ring is very accomodating also--it is usually harder to find rings like this in the larger size, 10. <end>  Great Ring!  This ring actually looked even better when I got it than I had believed it would. My daughter liked it so much that I gave it to her. <end>
 B000J2M36I  Sterling Silver Oval Garnet Gemstone Ring ||	  Much Nicer Than Pictured  I recently returned a garnet ring I had purchased from another company. While the stone was nice, the setting was very poor. When I received my refund, I decided to try this ring, despite the photo. I got it this morning and couldn't be happier. The setting is solid and of a very fine quality silver. Much nicer than the photo provided. The stone is a deep red without a hint a brown in it, and I love the "east-west" setting. This ring is sizeable without being a "knuckle-duster". It's just big enough to be seen, yet not too big to wear to work every day. It's elegantly simple and doesn't overpower my small hands. It even compliments the rather ornate wide band I wear on the other hand. Don't hesitate to order this ring  you won't be disappointed. <end>
 B000J2M4LW  Silver GENUINE BLUE TOPAZ Heart bali bezel Ring Size 10 ||	  Sweet and Simple  While shopping for holiday gifts this ring came up as a 'special' for only [...] How could I pass it up? I'm a sucker for rings most of the time so naturally I got it. It's so pretty and the pale blue stone goes with lots of my wardrobe. The fit is good and once on your finger you kind of forget you're wearing it. I'd recommend this ring for anyone looking for a pale blue topaz, or who likes heart shaped rings. <end>
 B000J2MAM0  Genuine Tiger Eye Chip Stretch Ring ||	  Very nice ring  This is a very nice ring the stones look genuine colors are rich but is not a good ring to wear if you cleaning or working with your hands is good for wearing to dinner or movie or just sitting around the house <end>
 B000J2O5RI  Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst Ring ||	  amethyst ring  It is a very nice ring, but the amethyst stone looked brighter in the pictures online. I was expecting a very purple stone, but it is rather translucent. Overall I am satisfied, but I wish the stone was darker <end>  Perfect quality!  A lot shinier than the pics, they don't do this ring justice! Read some review about the stone (which IS genuine and the reason i bought it) being translucent-I am totally satisfied with the stone glimmer and the 'bling' of the silver.+1 for fast shipping and highly recommend this seller and the item! Thank you so much! <end>  Christmas present  My daughter loved the ring! She received it in a timely manner and said she loves it so much. Thank you.Veronica <end>
 B000J2O6MC  Silver CHANNEL SET cz Simulated Diamond RING Size 7 ||	  Stunning, Classic, Elegant, Beautiful & Quality  I was given this ring by an ex several years ago and let's just say the ring far, far outshone and outlasted that romantic endeavor.The stones are flawless and almost put natural diamonds to shame (by virtue of being perfect, affordable, and these stones also have the added bonuses of no mining required, which means no humans have to be oppressed or enslaved to get them and the earth doesn't have to be stripped and ruined either).The sterling silver that this ring is made of does NOT tarnish, period; many times when I'd cleaned the house using bleach and forgotten to remove the ring never resulted in a moment of the metal being anything but the brilliant, beautiful sterling silver that it is.The fit is true to size; this ring is comfortable to wear and will make you smile every time you see it. This ring draws many, many compliments, too.If you're considering this ring and think the pictures show you how lovely it is, you're wrong; the picture comes no where near to capturing the amazing beauty this ring has to offer.In short? BUY IT. <end>
 B000J2O7O4  Silver 24K Gold Vermeil GENUINE MOP Flower Ring Size 6 ||	  The ring is beautiful, but...  This ring is beautiful and came very quickly. It was a present for my mother.I was very disappointed to find that two of the cubic zerconias were missing and one side of the band was extremely bent.All of these companies claim to be checking the items before shipping, but it is obvious that they are not!My mother loves the ring and I have sent it back for an exchange. Other than these flaws, the ring is very well made and it's a perfect size. <end>
 B000J2ODGQ  Genuine Amethyst, Aventurine, Rose Quartz, and Crystal Chip Ring ||	  Pretty but not functional  This ring is pretty but impossible to wear. It is way to bulky and your finger has to be spread away from the other fingers while it is on plus the chips constantly poke into you. One of those ideas that must have been good on paper but just do not translate. I have worn it on a chain before as a pendant and it did look nice that way for a fun casual look. <end>
 B000J2Q0A8  Sterling Silver Genuine Peridot RING S-5.5 ||	  Very Surprised  I was looking for an inexpensive ring to go w/ the 2prs. of peridot earrings I brought, I saw this ring it isn't my style of ring, but I said for 6.00 how can I go wrong, if I don't like it I can always give it to my daughter. Well I love it and my daughter wants one too. It's not large or bulky. It fits my hand perfectly. I will see what other stone it comes in and get those also. Oh yeah I must get my daughter her's too. <end>
 B000J2Q0D0  Genuine Blue Topaz 925 Silver DESIGNER TANK Ring S10 ||	  EXCELLENT EXCELLENT  I recently received this ring and is very please with the quality, finish and fit of the product. I would recommend it to everyone <end>
 B000J2Q0EY  Sterling Silver Marquise Shape Citrine Ring ||	  Just as pictured but one year later the silver plating wore off!  I ordered this ring because I love the marquise shaped citrine. The ring is big enough to be substantial but doesn't overwhelm my small hand (ring size 6). The metal is nicely polished and the stone is a nice honey color. Although the sides of the band are thicker than most rings, the ring still fits very comfortably on my hand. Great value for such a large gem.The silver plating has now wore off the band sides. I was under the impression that this ring was solid silver, it obviously is not. <end>  Great Every Day Ring  I was looking for a good ring to be my fall back every day ring and this is it. The thickness of the silver band gives it a nice casual appearance that looks great with jeans yet the marquise cut makes it work just as well with a suit or dress. Citrine is the gemstone of success and I like to wear it when I am at work. Citrine is also a wonderful manifestation crystal by motivating you into taking action. It also brings optimism and cheerfulness. The stone in my ring is a very pretty shade of yellow and the cut makes it sparkle. I have bought several rings from this company over the years and have been delighted with them all. <end>
 B000J2Q166  Sterling Silver Opal with Lavender CZ Side Stones Ring ||	  I LOVE THIS RING  I was very pleased with this ring. It is my birthstone, and I absolutely love it. It is exactly how it looks, and it arrived in a cute little blue drawstring sack. I LOVE IT !!! <end>  grand-daughter loved it!  This pretty ring was my grand-daughter's Christmas gift from me. She loved it! The ring is very pretty and seems durable. <end>  I do not recommend.  I was very disappointed. The opal is just a sliver....not round and full as pictured. It also was not set down in the setting properly. I returned it. I got a replacement....it was worse than the first. I returned it. They were very cooperative with the return and issued a full credit. <end>  Very disappointed  I purchased this ring as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter. I wanted to buy her a birthstone ring that was relatively inexpensive but still pretty enough that it would excite her to have a "grown up" piece of jewelry. The actual ring itself was misshapen (more oval than round- as if it was bent by previous wearing), the stones didn't even remotely match, and it looks very cheap- like something you'd get out of a gumball machine. I'm definitely going to return this. I paid $30 for this item- not super expensive for what would have been a child's ring, but WAY too much for what I received. Cheap and ugly  / <end>
 B000J2Q1BG  Silver Garnet Red Simulated Diamond Princess Ring S10 ||	  Very shiny crome  I was dissapointed with this purchase since I feel the ring is cheap-looking, but in fairness I must admit it looks very much like the picture. The metal is very shiny so it's obvious it's not silver. <end>
 B000J2Q1LG  24k Gold Vermeil 2 Tone GENUINE BLUE TOPAZ Leaf Ring S7 ||	  pleased  I think this is a darling ring. The color of the stone is pale but overall it is very attractive. <end>
 B000J2Q1NY  24K Gold Vermeil Simulated CZ Mens Ring Size 10 ||	  nice ring, but not happy with it  This ring looks great once you open the box. but put it on and within a few days it turns, and becomes more silver than gold. the stones still sparkle, the ring scratches easily. Poorly made, wish I had put my money elsewhere. <end>  Neon Glow  Sublime elegance . Simplicity viewing . Wraps around finger showing a neon glow in the sublight . Well thought out spaceing of stones giving it the appearance of a full catche of stones , larger than they are . Simplicity in motion and make up and gives full elegance on which ever finget it rests around . Clean lines giving it a very masculine dominance when socializing with friends and acquaintenances . Quality stands out from across the room . Smooth lines makes it a comfortable wearing ocassion . Stones are placed high from the surface allowing maximum radiance in any lighting situation . Each stone geometrically shaped to retain equality in sizeing . Superb smothing of edges allows comfortable fit in any hand/ finger gesture or configuration . Beautifully crafted piece og jewelry this 24K Gold Overlay Simulated Diamond cz Pave Mens Ring . <end>  beautiful ring...  I bought this ring a month ago, and let me just tell you guys...you wont regret purchasing this product. Its not flimsy or cheap looking, and I've only received positive comments about the ring. The only thing is that after a few days of wearing it, I noticed a few scratches on the underside of the ring...but hey, it happens right?  ). I definitely recomment this product, it makes a great gift as well. <end>
 B000J2Q8UA  Sterling Silver Blue Flower Design Spiral Junior Ring ||	  A little disappointed  I received my ring and was a little disappointed that the ring is not completely blue (like the picture shows). It looks like I got a blue flower with green leaves. So it makes the ring look blue and green. Very small ring. Not worth $6.99 but more like $3. <end>
 B000J34ELE  18kt Gold Over Sterling Silver Triple Rolo Link Chain Adjustable Necklace 16+2in ||	  very pretty and sparkly  The necklace is very nice quality and shows off well on the neck. It's not long, it sat right around my collar bones. But I rarely wear yellow gold. I thought I'd try this...but I felt the gold was a little too shiny/bright yellow. I guess I like brassy, copper-y and silver jewelry better. <end>
 B000J36GUQ  18kt Gold Over Sterling Silver Filigree Diamond Cut Earrings W/ Tear Crescent Drops ||	  Ok  I was looking for filigree earrings. I found these. i am not in love with these. but ok to wear once in a while as these are little heavy. after two to three hours you start feeling them.workmanship is also not excellent but ok. I want these to sell under $20. <end>
 B000J387Q2  CZ WEDDING RINGS - Simulated Diamond Cubic Zirconia Engagement and Wedding Rings ||	  real good product for the price  Bought it three weeks ago, We had to exchange it because the size was too big. Be careful to check the size a second or third time when ordering rings as the tab down is touchy. The ring is a real good prduct for the price. The gold is a little too gold though,silver would probably look more "real" but for a substitute ring or just something safer to wear when you don't want to lose your best, this works real fine. Don't think that a 35.00 ring is going to be confused for a 3,500.00 ring, it just ain't going to happen but for a night out or at the beach or park it is perfect. <end>
 B000J39GZS  Fons & Porter Quilters' Flat Head Pins, Beige, 100 Count ||	  Flat is better  I love these Flathead pins! You can iron over them and they are great for thick layers because of their longer length. I will use these pins for practically all my sewing projects. <end>
 B000J39O8M  CZ WEDDING RINGS - Simulated Diamond Cubic Zirconia Engagement and Wedding Rings ||	  real good product for the price  Bought it three weeks ago, We had to exchange it because the size was too big.

 B000J3HR2W  Fresh Water Pearl and 0.15 ct. Diamond Earrings in 14K White Gold ||	  Diamonds and Pearls  I just love these little earrings. The prettiest pearl and diamondstuds I have seen in a long time. <end>
 B000J3ZLOI  10k White Gold Blue Topaz Circle Pendant, 18" ||	  Nice  I purchased this necklace for my daughters 11th birthday. It was nicer than what I thought for $45. It is a smaller circle than you typically see at the jewelry stores, which was nice for me because it is for a pre-teen. I had also purchased the one with blue topaz and diamonds from amazon and liked this one better. The blue is a pretty color where on the other necklace it was washed out. <end>  lovely quality  The quality of the stones is very nice- better than the photo. They have a true sky-blue color, nice clarity, and lots of sparkle.It is a petite pendant...about the size of a dime... but the stones themselves are still a good size and give it a nice presence. This is to be a gift, but I'm sorely tempted to keep it for myself! <end>  Love it!  I bought this necklace 2 years and I still wear it all the time! The blue topaz looks exactly like the picture. Great find especially if you can get it on sale! <end>  very pretty pendant  The delivery was fast came inside a blue velvet bag , nice box. mail box very secure.the pendant is pretty, is small and perfect. i love the stones. i am very happy with this deal thank you. price very good. <end>  Perfect and delicate  This is super delicate look and a well done piece of jewelery. This is one of my favorites. Blue topaz and white gold makes a nice combination in my opinion. It is delicate and small though, don't expect something that will stand out around your neck. <end>
 B000J42UIW  14k White Gold Diamond & Blue Sapphire Filigree Hoop Earrings ||	  Good looking piece for the price  Each of the earrings is about the size of a dime; They are not too small. There are 4 square sapphires and 4 round diamonds on the surface of each earring. They are set up so that all 8 gems (on each earring) are visible from the front, so that you get maximum effect for what you have. (The "back end" of each earring does not contain any jewels).I am happy with the quality of the jewels. Of course I'd love for them to be bigger, but I am not displeased by any obvious imperfections or "off" colors.I actually made the earrings "a set" by also purchasing a White Gold Diamond and Sapphire Pendant for about the same price as the earrings. The full name of the pendant that I purchased on Amazon was "14k White Gold Sapphire and Diamond Pendant .21ctw (SI1/2 H-I)". I think they both go really well together.The packaging that the earrings come in is nice. It consists of two parts -an inner box and an outer box. The outer box is a nice blue paper box, and the interior box is a more traditional blue suede jewelry box. I did not feel the need to rewrap this item in a different container because it was nice the way it came.Please note that you can also get these same earrings with rubies, instead, if that is your thing... <end>
 B000J42UK0  14k White Gold Blue Topaz & Diamond Ring, Size 6 ||	  Lovely ring  I got this ring for my right hand- just an impulse buy on a day when they had a great sale. It was delivered right away. It is a little bigger than it looks- and a little bulkier. The blue stones in my ring are very pale blue. But it is a very pretty ring and I felt that at the sales price I paid, it was a bargain! <end>  beautiful rng  I have to get it resized but it's really beautiful and I'm glad I bought it. <end>
 B000J44QKW  Blue Moon Aventurine and Garnet Bracelet ||	  Great bracelet  Love this bracelet. Small dark blue flat gemstones mixed with red beads. Fits a 7 1/2 wrist great. Love the moon on the toggle. Wear it often. Highly recommend. <end>
 B000J4C0NW  Three Stone Cubic Zirconia Necklace ||	  Very disapointed  I have to say i was very disapointed with this necklace.It looks really pretty in the picture and i purchased this hoping to wear it to a marine corps ball.When i recieved my package i opened it up to find that it was just a pendant there was no chain for it.The aligment of the pendant was off to it was crooked and was not what i was expecting. <end>
 B000J4DD2O  Silver * SEAHORSE CHARM * Sea horse Fish ||	  Great Charm  This is a great charm, sterling silver, good detail, I made a necklace and a set of earrings from them. <end>
 B000J4DD2Y  Sterling Silver SAIL BOAT CHARM Sea ||	  different charm subbed  Charm substituted was not as cute and was single sided. I'll use it on my bracelet until I find better, but I'n not thrilled. <end>
 B000J4DD8S  Sterling Silver Mosaic Funky Turquoise Pendant ||	  Nice necklace!!!  Great transaction, arrived on time and my friend loved it! We were at a music festival that weekend and she got several compliments on it! Thanks! <end>
 B000J4DDLK  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz Horse Shoe Pendant ||	  Nice as expected  The pendant itself is lovely, though I feel the chain is a bit thin. All in all, a nice piece of jewelry. <end>
 B000J4DDNI  Vermeil (24kt Gold over Silver) Black Genuine Sapphire and Genuine Diamond Accent Pendant ||	  too small  this necklace looked nice on the internet so i purchased it. when i received it in the mail i was really disappointed, the chain is too thin and the pendant is too small ( for my taste) so i had to return it <end>
 B000J4DIJW  Sterling Silver Amethyst Flower Marcasite Locket Necklace, 18" ||	  AWESOME!!!  Beautiful necklace! Prettier than the picture! Great customer service as well. I emailed them, and responded within 4 hours--even on a Sunday! Perfect gift! <end>  Gorgeous Locket!!!  The photo of this locket does not show its true beauty!! What a surprise to see the sparkling clear sets that adorn the front of the locket along with the amethyst sets! I was originally drawn to its antique and dainty appearance and its unique shape and design. It is truly an elegant piece of jewelry - no one will believe it was inexpensive!! Great buy for the price and a terrific addition to your jewelry wardrobe! <end>  Very nice!  This was a gift for a friend. She loved it! I inspected it when it arrived, before I gave it to her, and I found myself wishing that I had gotten one for myself as well. <end>  Beautiful Locket  I Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas and can't wait to give it to here! It sparkles and it's so pretty - More beautiful then the photo! <end>  Very fragile  I recieved the locket today to inspect it before I give it to my friend. when I looked I couldnt believe how thin the chain was, It feels like if i hold it up it will just snap. Also the little hinge that makes the locket open is extremely loose and fragile. its beautiful and i have no doubt she will love it. But im going to get a new chain for it and find some way to fix the hinge. <end>  pretty  This locket is really nice. Bought if for a x-mas present and my mother really liked it as well. I would recommend this to anyone if you like purple. <end>  Nice necklace  Got this for my mother in law for mothers day and she loved it. The locket is really nice quality and was surprised how nice it was considering the price was not expensive at all. Good buy, recommended! <end>  pretty  not so sure the hinge is going to last but i like the design and weight, i have not put pictures in it yet and i am not sure how the pictures will stay in there is nothing to keep them in, i would imagine you just have to make sure the pictures fit tightly <end>  GREAT - the Wife likes this  The Chain is pretty brittle, but the locket itself looks fantastic. Shipping was a little slower than I expected. The locket is hard for her to open but she likes it a lot. <end>  Nice Locket  I got this for my wife as a present. She loved the locket, sadly the chain is very frail and broke after about 10 days. If purchasing understand that chain will probably need to be replaced. <end>  Great value  Very pretty, although I wouldn't go so far as to say prettier than the picture. It was smaller and much more fragile than the picture however. It does sparkle very beautifully, but it's hard to tell that there are actual gemstones on the locket from a few feet away. The stones themselves are pale purple, not as bright as the photo, but I found I liked them better in person; they're more delicate and subtle. Still, a wonderful Christmas gift, and if it doesn't break within a month of casual use, I'd say well worth it.  ) <end>
 B000J4DIK6  Sterling Silver Amethyst & Marcasite Heart Locket Necklace, 18" ||	  Sent broken item, careless with my exchange and were not curteous.  While the pendant itself is beautiful the first time it was sent broken and tangled. I wrote a lengthy letter explaining that this was intended to be a Christmas gift and I needed an exchange right away. I asked that the exchanged item be made sure that the latch worked properly, easily opening and closing without breaking. The exchanged item was very difficult to open and I was afraid it might break. Eventually, it opened using jewelry pliers. The hinge looks fragile and not made well. For something that is supposed to be a locket, it does not act like it. Beyond the poor construction, the only paper sent back to me was a copy of my invoice with a sloppy "exchange" hand written over it. A simple courtesy letter apologizing briefly would have sufficed, especially since I had to pay shipping to send it back to them. No level of recognition was made to me. Any business should know to at least have a stock letter to the customer in dealing with any problem. I do it for my own clients and I expect the same of every other business, no matter how big or small. I will not be buying from them again. <end>  Jewelry is stained after only minimal wear!  The piece is beautiful and it's comfortable to wear, looks GREAT. But after only a couple months the pendant is worn out looking and stained. Looks awful. I won't wear it anymore. <end>
 B000J4DIL0  Sterling Silver Filigree Marcasite & Genuine Blue Topaz Cross Locket ||	  Nice, with a couple of flaws  I've been looking for a locket for a while now and purchased this not all too long ago. For the most part, it is a nice one. It has a sturdy feeling to it when closed and a nice weight. The stone is clear and well set, and if it were to fall out, it would fall out in the locket; it's open-backed. The silver is thick and relatively impervious to applied pressure. It isn't flimsy. What I did note however is a problem with the backing to this locket, and I doubt I just got a poor piece. I've noticed Silverspeck has many different variations of the same sort of pendant, and the backing here doesn't quite fit. I'd gather the fronts and backs are made separately and not much time is granted to make sure once the two halves are put together that they fit well. When opening the locket the hinge is liberal and loose; it swivels somewhat generously in all directions, and it isn't something I can fix.The edges of the backing also protrude past the front giving it a sort of "overbite" in some places, which is marginally noticeable. If you plan on putting anything in the locket, be aware there may be some large cracks or spaces when it is closed. For example, I wished to put a single, looped circle of horsehair in here, which comes out pretty thick with the twining, and I was worried about it falling out if the tape failed. Old heirloom lockets I've had rarely, if ever, had this problem, but things by default are not made that well or meticulously anymore. So if there's anything thin and special you plan on putting in it, this may be relevant. Even so, it's a solid and quality locket aside from the points I put down. Is it worth the price? I'm still not sure on that. But it is a pretty piece if you don't expect perfection. <end>  The locket is exquisite  You are buying the locket here - not the chain - yes it comes with a cheap chain, but the purchase is all about the locket. The locket is much more beautiful in person. I bought this for my Sister-in-law who prefers "estate-like" pieces & it was a hit. Definitely the right choice for her. I was torn about which stone to choose because you could go any which way - but ultimately decided on the blue topaz which is her birth stone. She loved it - and the locket really is gorgeous - you will not be disappointed in anyway with this purchase it is much prettier in person. As for the clasp issues mentioned with some of the other lockets the locket was very secure - there was no way this baby was gonna fly open! <end>  blue topaz locket  Beautiful locket; cheap chain. The chain broke after wearing it for 4 days. The links in the chain are very weak. <end>  Thanks grand kids loved it  Thanks this was a gift and they seened to like itwill look at ordering other items when they are needed <end>  Marcasite and topaz  I like marcasite and the topaz gem stone set this off. This was a gift to a granddaughter.If you like marcasite, I highly recommend this item. <end>
 B000J4DK90  Sterling Silver Genuine Sapphire & Diamond Cross Pendant ||	  STANDOUT QUALITY!!  I purchased this cross to make a rosary for my daughters wedding (since sapphire is her birthstone). She had a destination wedding in Italy,and everybody loved it (especially the bride!). I actually bought (2) crosses like this,one was on the rosary, and the other one was on "a double rosary called a "lazo",that is also used in the Catholic wedding. <end>
 B000J4DLBW  Sterling Silver Genuine Marcasite Stone Elephant Pin ||	  Good Luck Elephant Pin  My Mother-in-law had a Good Luck Elephant pin that she wore to casinos for years. After her passing, my wife looked for her pin for years without success. After much searching, I found this pin on Amazon in time for Christmas. My wife is thrilled. The pin is beautiful, albeit somewhat smaller then I thought it would be. The price was reasonable compared to some of the other pins I saw. Time will tell if the "Good Luck" function really works. My wife feels lucky to have it, so that's good enough for me.Thanks Amazon. <end>
 B000J4DNHO  Sterling Silver Toe Ring with Channel Set Pink CZ ||	  perfect  Very sparkly, shiny and well made. the silver is thick and not too plyable. I've had it on since I've gotten it 3 days ago. I dont feel it at all. I love it.It was here in less than a week. <end>
 B000J4DNHY  Sterling Silver Toe Ring with Channel Set Multi Colored CZ ||	  Really expensive looking silver toe ring.  Look like a princess when wearing this toe ring, glitters and glistens day and night, wear it always and get it right. <end>  Brighten summer toes!  This is one of several toe rings I bought, and I have to admit that I am overall VERY PLEASED with it. It is well made, fits nicely, and has very good sparkly stones. The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that the stones are very, very light--much lighter than the image. It looks a lot like the faux diamond one rather that a multi-colored one. However, it is very attractive, and I have no intention of returning it. It has made a nice addition to my summer accessories, even it I was expecting something a little more colorful. <end>  No go.  Did not receive the item I requested. Because of the low cost of the item, I didn't return it. <end>
 B000J4DPTK  GENUINE LEATHER CHAIN Sterling Silver .925 18 in. ||	  loose end cap  I received this item and it is what I was looking for but the end cap needed repair before I could wear it. It had come loose. <end>

 B000J4DRL6  Sterling Silver Pink & Clear CZ Square and Circle Tennis Bracelet ||	  Very shiny and sturdy  Very sparkly and the sterling is very shiny and has held up its shine despite contact with water. The gems are good sized and very sparkly, looks great layered with other bangles. <end>  Freakin Beautiful!!!  i don't care what any of the other reviews said. this bracelet is BEAUTIFUL!! i bought this for my friend and it really is VERY identical to the picture displayed. The actual color of stones look exactly like the picture. They're not darker at all. That's what i was mainly concerned about before i got it..but it looks PERFECT! haha When u first look at it..in real life..u'll be stunned  D This bracelet is a VERYYYY NICE buy, plus shipping was pretty fast too! <end>  a bit disappointed  this bracelet is very pretty i loved the way it looked on the internet but i was a bit disappointed with the actual colour when i recived it. what made me even more disappointed is the fact that i only wore it once and a stone fell off. <end>  Pretty in Pink  Very pretty and sparkly. I received many compliments the first time I wore it. The pink stones are darker than the picture. About 7 1/4" in length, 1/4" wide. I also have it in black,Sterling Silver Black Sqaure and Simulated Diamond CZ Circle Bracelet, and red,Sterling Silver Red Sqaure and Simulated Diamond CZ Circle Bracelet. <end>
 B000J4DS0Q  Genuine Freshwater Cultured Pink Pearl 4mm Stretch Bracelet ||	  cute!  Bought this for my newborn daughter and I love it. Get compliments on it all the time! Looks so cute with any outfit that she is wearing. Sometimes I wear it also because it stretches and I have thin wrists, I also get compliments. Very happy with it and the price was GREAT! <end>  GREAT PRETTY WANT MORE  I BOUGHT 3 COLORS AND I AM SO HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. THEY ARE A GREAT VALUE AND GO WITH ANY OUTFIT. I AM BUYING SOME FOR CHRISTMAS WITH EARRINGS TO MATCH. GREAT GIFTS AND CHEAP. I LOVE THEM, THEY DON'T LOOK CHAEAP AT ALL. MY FRIENDS WILL ENJOY THEM ALSO. GREAT BUY !!! <end>  Very Thin Pearl Bracelet  The fresh water pearl bracelet was a great deal but is very thin in person. I would recommend buying it as a first bracelet for a lil girl. <end>  4mm cultural pearls bracelet  As a previous customer of Silver Speck I purchased 3 sets of 4 mm cultural pearls and a Genuine Amethyst Peridot Citrine Crystal Chip Bracelet. I have been so pleased with my earlier orders I was not suprised that the chip bracelet was stunning and loved by my daughter on her birthday.It was then with much suprised to find the cultured pearls were 2mm not 4mm as advertised. I wrote to Silver Speck and received a reply from Brenda that the pearls were 4mm but if I was unhappy that I could return them and my account would be credited with in 5-10 days.I wrote back that the time involved and cost of mailing was not worth the cost and that they indeed were 2mm and sent a photo of the pearls next to a set of 4 mm pearls laid on a metric ruler.She replied the same as before.I see no reason why they should not pay for the shipping as it was their (error?) mistake.It is a sad way to end an business relationship. <end>
 B000J4FCI2  Sterling Silver slide pendant w/ round bezel set Genuine Citrine stone ||	  Needs a new photo  Please, take a new pic of this necklace, it is so much prettier in person. Also, take side shot to show how much silver is used. For the price, I never expected it. Even the chain is beyond what most companies give us. I will definitely shop with this company again. <end>
 B000J4FD2W  Silver HALLOWEEN PUMPKIN CHARM Cool ||	  Symbol of my nostalgia!  Quick shipping(i found it in my mailbox after 10 days or so after having place an order). The price was great as well. The pendant is cute and tiny halloween pumpkin, little, but still well made. I've had it since 2007 and I alwas wear it not only on Halloween parties but almost all autumn time, as it reminds me of something mystic, warm, beautiful , about hidden miracles, about eternal love and many-many other associations. Besides of all that, this is the best halloween pumpkin pendant ever. I never found something(even just similar to it) like this again. I've got my silver jewerly halloween collection, this item was the first and by now I have all classic halloween symbols  a cat, a spiderweb(a ring), a witch(a ring), two small spiders, a bat. But best of all I dearly love this pumpkin. It's some kind of talisman for me- lots of changes, lots of events since the day I've got it... <end>

 B000J4FKDO  Sterling Silver Floating Heart Pendant, 18" ||	  Absolutely Beautiful  My granddaughter wanted a floating heart necklace for Christmas. Looked at other reviews and was a little hesitant to buy, however, this was beautiful. Someone said the chain was flimsey, but I pulled on the chain and it was strong. My teenage granddaughter has been wearing it since I gave it to her and will not take off. Great piece of jewelry. <end>  heart pendant  nice chain is a little thin but charm is pretty. I ordered two i am happy with them for the price but may use another chain. <end>  Surprisingly really nice!  Because of the low price, I was not sure what to expect with this necklace. It's sooo nice! Chain is not flimsy, but delicate...and heart is the right size. Looks like a nice Tiffany knock off. This is a Valentine's present for my step-daughter and it's perfect. <end>  Nice simple necklace  Bought this for a now ex-girlfriend. The necklace is not very showy, but has a simple beautiful elegance to it. Seems very durable. Much stronger than our relationship, in any rate. <end>  An inexpensive replica  Very pretty. My daughter likes it a lot. It's slightly larger than the Tiffany heart it resembles. My daughter can wear this while my Wife wears her Tiffany pendant and I don't have to worry about my daughter losing hers too much. <end>  Gorgeous  I bought this for a gift for my best friend. I must tell you, I have the tiffany version of this necklace. When we opened it, I was like WOW- this is just like my version but WAY less expensive. Overall  buy it, wear it, love it. <end>  Very cute  I got this for my 14 yr old sons 1st girlfriends birthday present, and was surprised at how nice it was for the price. I want one of my own, and I am pretty picky when it comes to jewelry for myself. <end>  Heart necklace  I love this necklace. I don't wear much jewelry but this is dainty and I can wear it everyday its simple and sits just perfectly. <end>  chain should have been little more thick  i was expecting little more. not 100% satisfied. Not sure how stong it is. i dont want to test it anyway. <end>  Its ok  The pendant is small, i am not sure if it is real sterling silver.....it looks weird. I am a little bit dissapointed <end>  nice pendant, bad chain  Pendant was what I was looking for. Small, pretty heart. Chain broke within 3 wearings, but that didn't matter much. <end>  Awww, so happy  This is beautiful. Was a gift from my husband 20+ years ago, but lost it. Love wearing it and the silver is beautiful. <end>  Heart Pendant  Arrived in cute little bag and shipped fast. Great for women of any age and everyday wear! Gave this to my Mom and she loved it, wears it all the time. Can't beat the price. <end>  Crappy chain  I was very excited to get the necklace because it had decent reviews and the price was perfect. I put it on as soon as I got it a gave a slight pull on the chain to make sure it was on and it immediately broke! It is very disappointing, especially because I was planning on wearing with with my husbands dog tags while he deploys! The heart pendant itself is cute, but now I have to go buy another chain! <end>  sterling sliver heart necklace  i like this necklace it fits its description as shown online... but very thin necklace... its affordableand i can wear it with any type of style clothing i wear and reasonable <end>  Beautiful  This item was beautiful. I am getting married in March and we are using this as a gift for his daughter. <end>  Fun  This was a pretty little necklace for my daughter. She loves it, and I like that I know she is wearing real silver instead of the junky play jewelry. <end>  For a 9 year old girl  I got this for my niece for Christmas. I wanted to give her something special to keep until she gets older. Something that she would look back an cherish. SHe loved this necklace. <end>  A Hit with my wife  I bought this heart as one of the presents for my wife for Christmas. She is delighted with the heart and the necklace. The necklace is quite dainty, befitting a real lady. <end>  great for the price  the chain was a bit flimsy but otherwise a great purchase for the price.

 B000J4FMP0  Genuine Rose Quartz Stone Sterling Silver Filigree Rectangle Pendant ||	  GENUINE ROSE QUARTZ STONE STERLING SILVER FILIGREE RECTANGLE PENDANT  Excellent product from this seller; would definitely buy from them again. Lovely and delicate rose quartz stone, backed on a beautiful and intricate filigree pendant; very soft looking; excellent gift idea!! A+++++++ to the seller!!! And incredibly fast service!! <end>  Pretty in an old-fashioned way  I wanted a simple rose quartz pendant to wear to work on days I 'need' this stone. I feel this piece has an old-fashion charm to it. The stone is not perfectly aligned into the mould but it's not noticeable within the usual social distance. Reasonably priced, it would make a meaningful gift. p.s. I wanted the lapis lazuli pendant but they only had it on silverspeck's website. <end>
 B000J4FMV4  Sterling Silver Reconstituted Blue Turquoise Stone Bali Beaded Oval Pendant ||	  pretty  The quality is excellent and the color is nice, but I wish it would have been a little bigger. <end>

 B000J4FSE0  Sterling Silver Bracelet with Scarab cut Genuine Aventurine, Onyx, Rose Quartz, Tiger Eye, Lapis ||	  Gorgeous Sterling Scarab Bracelet  Bracelet was just gorgeous even more beautiful in person than in photo. Will shop with this seller again! <end>  Pretty Bracelet, Poor Quality Scarabs  The silver bracelet offered a very pretty setting, but I was so disappointed in the quality of the scarabs. Typically, scarabs have a nice sheen, but these were dull and lackluster. Silver Speck refunded my money. <end>  Pretty but would have preferred a lobster clasp. The colors of the stones are just wonderful. I would recommend this product but  I would aslo tell them it has a spring clasp. It has some weight to it, so you know you have it on,but not heavy.I love it and sterling silver it becoming a favorite. <end>  Scarab Bracelet  I bought this bracelet for my friend for her Birthday and she absolutely loved it! The stones are so pretty! <end>  Love It!!  I love this bracelet and the shine on the scarabs are great. I just wish you used a lobster claw clasp inside of a spring clasp closure and the scarabs should be a little deeper cut. Nevertheless, it's nice a bracelet for the price. <end>
 B000J4FSEU  Lovely! Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Chinese Motif & multi color Genuine Jade and Genuine Onyx Bracelet ||	  Bought as a present/Recipient very happy  I bought this for my daughter who had lost one she bought in China. She thought it was a very good approximation of the one she had lost and liked it very much. It is very pretty. <end>  Love It!  This is an absolutely beautiful bracelet. And it arrived promptly. I wear it often, as it goes with everything. Would buy from this seller again. <end>  Good deal  This bracelet is a good value...the gold is very thin though so I'm very careful not to twist it. The colors of the jade are very nice and go with all outfits, so I wear it every day. <end>  Horrible Quality  I purchased this bracelet for a gift. It appeared to be a beautiful bracelet but it fell apart! The pieces of jade separated from the gold/silver part of the bracelet. When the gift was opened, the bracelet fell apart. The recipient glued it with a jeweler's glue but 10 days later another piece came apart. Horrible, horrible quality. I was very embarrassed. Purchasers BEWARE! <end>
 B000J4FSP4  Sterling Silver Bracelet with Simulated Tanzanite CZ & Simulated Diamond CZ ||	  Awesome bracelet  This bracelet is very pretty and it is definitely worth the price. I was very happy when I opened it and saw how nice actually is...the "tanzanite" stones are a great purplish/blue color, the clasp is nice and the bracelet is a good weight-not flimsy. Love it! <end>
 B000J4FSRC  Sterling Silver Purple & White CZ Estate Bracelet ||	  Unique Look  Plenty of sparkle and nice vintage look. Simulated amethysts are lighter than pictured, but still have plenty of color. Length 7 1/2". Width 3/8" for the wider link, 3/16" for the narrower link. <end>

 B000J4FTVC  Sterling Silver Twisted D Cut Chain Bead Anklet 9" Made in Italy .925 ||	  I returned it and was never notified of the amount taken off my credit card. That was over 4 weeks ago.  The anklet was nice, but my daughter wanted to return it. I never got an e-mail stating that it was returned, nor did I get it taken off my credit card as of yet. <end>
 B000J4FU0W  Sterling Silver Black & White CZ Square and Circle Tennis Bracelet ||	  Lots of Sparkle!  I also have this bracelet in the pink,Sterling Silver Square and Circle Pink CZ and Simulated Diamond CZ Tennis Bracelet, and the red,Sterling Silver Red Sqaure and Simulated Diamond CZ Circle Bracelet. I ordered this one because I received so many compliments on the pink one and I'm not disappointed. Every stone sparkles like crazy! It's much prettier than the picture! 7 1/4" length, 1/4" wide. <end>  Not pleased  The bracelet is not what I expected. I was getting the bracelet to go with a black stoned sterling silver ring I have. The bracelet looks like costume jewelry, it is not something you would wear with a nice piece of jewelry. I have not returned it, because I hate going to the trouble of doing it. <end>
 B000J4FU3E  Sterling Silver Created Pink Opal and Genuine Diamond Acccent Bracelet ||	  Perfect  The bracelet is just as pictured. The opals are a very pretty pink. It is a great bracelet for the price. <end>  Beautiful bracelet  This bracelet is beautiful. The pink opals are gorgeous. The closure is secure and it is a nice length. This is a thin bracelet and would work well for a younger person also. I always wear more than one bracelet at a time, so it pairs well with other pink bracelets. <end>
 B000J4FUGG  Sterling Silver Oval Genuine Sapphire and Genuine Diamond Accent Leaf Bracelet ||	  looks awesome  it looks awesome and is very pretty , the only thing i would like is if it had 1 or 2 additional links, as it is a smaller bracelet <end>  Pretty for the price  The silver bracelet is very beautiful and the sapphire are on the deep blue side. The diamonds are very small and are not in very leaf. For the Price is was a great buy. <end>  not the best thing I have bought  This bracelet is technically what it is sold as. There were 2 tiny diamonds on the one I received and it took me forever to find them. The sapphires are very included. It does not look bad on the wrist and if you don't plan to have people looking at it too closely it is fine. It does have a nice over all look when being worn. The silver work is good, heavy enough to wear often. The clasp is really nice and has a safety catch. <end>
 B000J4FUYS  Genuine Carnelian Stone 6mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  I am in love with these carnelians!  I love carnelian and this bracelet is a wonderful addition to my jewelry collection. The stone beads are round (not faceted) and uniform in shape and size. The color is also impressive. The beautiful pouch that came with this bracelet was definitely a bonus. Thank you SilverSpeck! <end>  Too orange looking  Liked the bracelet and the beads. Very nice quality!Beads just looked too orange and was looking for more red like the picture . <end>  Great bracelet!  The smaller carnelian beads have a clear beautiful orange color. It would be great if the elastic was the same color of the beads. Very beautiful. <end>
 B000J4FYDA  Sterling Silver Reconstituted Blue Turquoise Bali Beaded Bangle Bracelet ||	  Very lovely. Good Quality for the price  This is a very nice silver bracelet for the price. It might not fit over a larger sized hand, but otherwise it's a lovely casual piece that works great with my other silver bangles. <end>
 B000J4FYEE  Simulated Pink Cats Eye Stone 8mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Disappointed  I guess I'm not a fan of cat's eye. The cat's eye on the beads was not as white as in the picture. It looked gray and I didn't like it. <end>
 B000J4FYF8  Reconstituted Blue Turquoise Stone 8mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Pretty Shade of Blue  This bracelet isn't as blue as the picture, but it still is a nice blue shade of turquoise.

 B000J4FYGM  Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Hammered Bangle ||	  nice bangle but flimsey  this is a pretty bangle. its just kind of flimsey. but nice for the price <end>
 B000J4FYIU  Sterling Silver Diamond Weave Bangle Cuff Bracelet ||	  WOW  Much nicer than I expected. It is nicely made and quite large. It is polished to a high shine and has a delicate lacy appearance when on the wrist. It is my boldest bracelet to date and I am glad that I added it to my jewelry wardrobe. <end>
 B000J4FYT4  Sterling Silver Bali Beaded Bangle ||	  Is it really silver ???  Looks beautiful but i do not think that it is genuine sterling silver. It goes black and dirty pretty fast and needs to be cleaned very often. Comparing to other silver bangle from other store, which stays shiny all time, this bangle is disappointing. <end>
 B000J4FZMK  Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst Peridot Citrine Crystal Chip Necklace ||	  Amethyst Peridot Citrine Necklace  Nice necklace though larger size stones than the other necklaces I oredered. Fast shipping and packaged well. Recommend to all. <end>  Nice item  The stones appear to be genuinely genuine, but the clasp broke as soon as I tried to put it on. I was able to fix it though. The only problem I have with it now is that I have a large neck and it doesn't hang lower than I'd like. <end>
 B000J4GF38  Sterling Silver Genuine Onyx and Carnelian Double Heart Pendant ||	  Sterling Silver Genuine Onyx and Carnelian Double Heart Pendant  Gave it to my gf ... she never wore it again ... lolxxxxSo much for a Valentine's Gift <end>
 B000J4GFS8  Sterling Silver Sky Blue Enamel Butterfly Pin ||	  Smaller than Inspected  This beautiful pin was smaller than I expected. I should have checked the size before I order it. "My fault". <end>
 B000J4GLYQ  Sterling Silver Lavander cz Stone Cross Pendant ||	  Beautiful Pendant!  I was expecting this pendant to be "cute", but to my happy surprise, it is beautiful! I bought it to wear casually with tee shirts and such, but it is so pretty and of such high quality, I wear it w/ my work clothes and going out as well! Additionally, the chain that came with it (which I did not think was included!), is wonderful! I love it, and again much better quality than I expected.An incredible value for a very high quality piece! <end>
 B000J4GM3G  Sterling Silver Marcasite Flower Locket with a Genuine Garnet Heart ||	  Beautiful scent Locket  This locket is so much prettier in person then in the picture! The silver has a beautiful shine to it, and the garnet just radiates red beauty. I'm using this as a scent locket, and it has plenty of openings in the front to let perfume waif out. <end>  nice looking  you get what you see. Very nice locket. Might have some problem when i'll put some pictures in it since there is holes around the heart. <end>
 B000J4GOL6  Sterling Silver Genuine Diamond Accent and Genuine Ruby open Heart Pendant ||	  Ok, but a little small  The diamond and ruby heart is lovely for a young lady, but too small for me. The chain is very fragile. Very fast shipping. <end>  Perfect  I bought this for my mother on her birthday an she absolutely loved it. Although it would be better if it was a bit bigger it was still very pretty an i was satisfied with the smile on my mother face when i gave this to her. <end>  Daintily Beautiful  I just received this pendant in the mail and other than having to untangle the chain when I first opened it, it's perfect. The heart without the bale is about the size of a penny which is just perfect for me since I like dainty jewelry. The rubies and diamonds are pretty and the silver is highly polished with rhodium plating. The chain it came with is also comfortable and all in all, it is a lightweight, comfortable, beautiful necklace and it looks just like it does in the picture online. I am pleased  ) <end>
 B000J4GOUM  Sterling Silver Genuine Rhodocrosite Stone Bali Beaded Circle Pendant ||	  Great  This item turned out to be just as pretty as pictured, and if you watch rhodochrosite on e-bay, you'll know that it's usually more expensive than this piece and not as attractive. The chain is very nice. There is an oval shaped rhodochrosite pendant (ASIN B000J4FMKU)that I suspect is just as pretty if not prettier. I've had a very good experience with just about every item I've bought from SilverSpeck. <end>
 B000J4GP8S  Sterling Silver Genuine Lapis Stone Bali Bead Pendant ||	  she loved it  This was a gift for my teenage daughter who loves the lapis stone. Great price for what you get! Very pretty and elegant. <end>  Finally  I have been looking for the lapis stone for years. I believe I am correct in saying that it is mined in only one country  PERU. I bought two small pieces to see if I would like them and I do. There is a story behind the lapis stone, that it is a spititual stone, has spiritual qualities. I have read up a great deal on this and obviously believe it. I will be going back to Amazon .com to pick out a pricier one in the near furure. See my next item of lapis. <end>
 B000J4GPG0  Bow Ribbon Simulated CZ and Simulated Tanzanite CZ Filigree Silver Pin ||	  pathetic  not what i expected.....i will have to resell it,and trust me, I will get my moneys worth. this is baby jewelry...I have far better CZ jewelry. Never again, once taken, forever shy.... <end>
 B000J4GS3A  Etched Smiling Sun Sterling Silver Toe Ring ||	  toe ring  The person I gave it to hasn't taken it off yet! Sturdy and cute! <end>
 B000J4GS3U  Sterling Silver Funky Toe Ring ||	  Funky toe ring  This funky toe ring is small so don't order if you have fat toes, looks good on but feels unsafe, ( I have fat toes! ), it's well made and very strong. <end>  Tiny  I was kind of disappointed with this because it's really small. I don't think my toes are fatter than anyone else's but this ring cannot fit even near the base of my toe. I have to put it on the smallest part and even then the adjustable part doesn't come close enough to be secure. I can't even get it past the nail on my pinky finger. I have a feeling it will either break or im going to lose it. It also disappointing because I was looking for something that would be secure and sturdy. It looked in the picture like it would be something that would meet my needs. In reality, it's really just a sliver of silver that's tiny. It did, however, arrive pretty quickly. <end>
 B000J4GUG0  5mm Genuine Freshwater Cultured Pink Pearl Sterling Silver Beaded Infant Baby Girl Bracelet ||	  Adelyn's grams  My granddaughter has not had this off since the day she was born! Her mother just loves it. Unfortunately it's about time for a bigger one. <end>  Prettier then I thought  I got this bracelet for my three month old daughter! As soon as I got it, I put it on, it was PERFECT. It's beautiful, fits great, with room to grow. Love the color too! Well crafted, don't feel worried it might break. The only down side, I think, is the clasps is a little hard to do, especially with a wiggling newborn. But once I practiced more, I can get it on rather quickly now. All and all this bracelet looks more than it costs, and I don't feel guilty for buying something she can't wear for too long, when I didn't pay much. Other bracelets, like this one, cost almost 50 dollars! I plan on keeping it safe, so she can pass it down to hopefully her little girl  ) <end>  Simply elegant  i bought the 4.0 for my 3m old baby girl and it is simply gorgeous. I love the color and the size of the pearls. <end>  bracelet  I love the the color and the style. This product was actually for my toddler but when I received it, it was too small for her chunky, arm. So I decided to give it to a friend, she loved it and receives compliments on the bracelet all the time.[...], [...][...], [...] <end>  so pretty  This bracelet is very pretty and has held up well so far. Every time my daughter wears it she shows it off and says "pretty bracelet." <end>  Very Cute!!  The bracelet in itself is a little bit smaller than I thought. But when I put it on my niece's wrist, it looks adorable. The price is pretty good, too. I would recommend this to anyone. <end>  Beautiful Bracelet  I ordered a size to small and they were very quick to send out a bigger one. The pearl isnt as pink as it shows but still very nice. <end>  precious  These pearls are nicely made and simply precious. I got this bracelet for my 4yr old (~30lbs)--she hasn't taken it off since Christmas (over a month) and it hasn't changed at all. It probably won't fit her for much longer, though, so it would probably be better to buy for someone even younger. <end>  so pretty!  a perfect little bracelet for a perfect little girl!! just the right size for a newborn! added a cross and name medallion in sterling for a finishing touch! <end>  I freaking love it!  i just got this bracelet exactly 10 minutes ago in the mail for my Daughter first piece of jewelry and she's a little 2 month old chubster lol but it fit perfectly and beautifully with a little room to spear. i absolutely love it!!!!! its just adorable!!! <end>  Another great item for great granddaughter.  I purchased two braclets for my great granddaughter, and was very impressed; so was my granddaughter. I was also nice of Amazon.com to have them shipped to my grandaughter's apartment in another town. Will surely be ordering more gifts, especially with the holidays coming up. Thank you Amazon.com. <end>  Pretty Bracelet  I ordered this bracelet for my niece when she was born and wasn't sure it was going to fit her when I got it (I got the smallest size). She ended up being an 8 lb baby but it still fit, though probably not for long, and looked pretty in her hospital pictures. It's a great price and I highly recommend. <end>
 B000J4GVUA  Sterling Silver Fox Tail Bracelet ||	  nice, but too long  This bracelet is too long to wear around my wrist and I do not have small wrists. <end>
 B000J4GWR2  Sterling Silver Millefiori multi-color Murano Glass beaded Square Bracelet ||	  adorable  This bracelet is adorable. I do wish the size had been listed as it is only about a 7 inch bracelet. I bought it as a gift but wanted to keep it for myself. <end>
 B000J4GWYU  Genuine Rose Quartz Chip Stretch Bracelet ||	  beautiful  I love Silver Speck and their chip bracelets are beautiful. I have several different ones and get compliments on them all the time. <end>  Sweet  For a small single bracelet, it is sweet. The color is very pale, I wish it were brighter, but it still is sweet. <end>  very good  very pretty and it has a very soft and soothing energy. i get a lot of compliments on it too. <end>  Rose Quartz Bracelet  The rose quartz chip bracelet was as looked in the pic and described. The price was good. And I was happy to git it. It's so smooth and pretty. <end>  Very Pretty Rose Quartz  Huge fan of Rose Quartz and this is the perfect bracelet. Can also make a great gift for anyone that also likes rose quartz as well. I received it in a short time and wore it the very same day I received it. <end>  very pretty!  i bought three of these,and three of the same make but different stones.i bought the rose quartz for what it stands for.i have one,and got two for the lil girls next door.i paid 3/each.they look good enough to wear on a nice dinner,but yet casual,they stretch a good amount,and the string is some sort of plastic string,and it looks like it's put together with a quite a few strings to avoid breaking.they have held up through showers and household tasks.i love it,and the littls girls do too.perfect stocking stuffer,party favors, or for active lil girls <end>  G  These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit. Since they were so inexpensive, I was able to give everyone a gift. <end>
 B000J4GX9E  Genuine Hematite, Onyx, and Sterling Silver Beaded Bracelet ||	  Disappointing quality  This bracelet looks beautiful, but after I received it I was very disappointed in the quality. The beads are of good quality and very pretty, but the silver connection rings look like pieces of cheap twisted wire that do not fit into the clasp. The beads were so tightly strung that the the bracelet would not straighten out flat. I returned the bracelet for a refund. <end>
 B000J4GXA8  Genuine Hematite Healing Stone 4mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Do not like it  I'm not sure if this is real hematite, because it is not magnetic. Other hematite that I have purchased from other sellers is magnetic. I also do not like the way it looks. It looks cheap, and you can see the seam where it was glued together. It does not look right. I would not wear this item, but I do not have time right now to worry about re-packaging it and sending it back, so I guess I will just have to consider it a loss. Other than that, shipping was fast, and there were also no problems with packaging... just did not like the item. <end>
 B000J4H1NQ  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Champagne & Clear CZ Teardrop Estate Bracelet ||	  gorgeous jewelry  i have gotten so many compliments on this jewelry and some are very interested in ordering such a gorgeous item. the description fits the item and more. thanks. <end>
 B000J4H2GM  Sterling Silver 4mm Genuine Lapis Stone Bead Beaded Chain 15-19" Necklace ||	  Beautiful lapis!  Lapis lazuli is a beautiful stone that has been mined by man since prehistoric times. Indeed, in ancient Mesopotamia, it was considered the queen of gemstones, and was highly sought after for jewelry. Now is your opportunity to own a piece of lapis jewelry for yourself!This handsome necklace is made of lapis beads, strung along a genuine silver chain. Its beautiful blue color looks excellent with formal, semi-formal, and even completely casual outfits.

 B000J4H2ZS  Sterling Silver Spring Green,Blue,Yellow, and White Millefiori Disc Murano Glass Necklace ||	  My one looks a little different in real life  I am a little disappointed with this, it does not look as good in real life as it does in the picture. In the picture it looks nice and clear and bright but mine is a little less clear and a bit blurry. It is still cute and I'm sure many people would love it but I personally would not have bought it had I seen it in real life first. On the plus side, it is not as heavy as I thought it might be. Don't be put off from getting it, just be aware that it is a little more muted in real life than in the picture. I would definitely recommend this seller though and all of the other products I have bought from them have been higher quality than I expected. <end>

 B000J4H6KO  Sterling Silver CZ Square Stud Earrings ||	  Style with a small price.  I was quite surprise about the quality of these earrings. They have some weight to them when you first pick them up. Not heavy, but more weight than I thought for such cheap earrings. They look better than some cz earrings I got from Sears and I paid 10x's as much for those. I am very pleased. <end>  Love these!  These are the perfect size. Nice basket setting, very believable. I would buy them again in a heartbeat! <end>
 B000J4H6UY  Tanzanite CZ Sterling Silver Hoop Earrings ||	  Nice Earrings  These are very pretty earrings. Not too big, not too small. Though the stones are tiny, they are nicely colored and stand out well against the silver. The earrings are comfortable and stay on. Great gift for anyone with pierced ears. <end>  earrings  these earrings are very nice, look just the same as on the computer very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Great Earrings!  I love "Inside Out" style hoop earrings. I was specifically looking for Tanzanite and found these. They really look like Tanzanite and they are just the right size of hoop! I would love them even more if the stones were just a little bigger, but for the price, I am very happy with my purchase! I also bought some larger Tanzanite CZ stud earrings which are very nice. <end>  very nice item fairly priced  i bought these as a little gift for my fiancee...she adores them and they look fantastic...highly recommend this for silver and tanzanite lovers...i will buy from this company repeatedly <end>  Comfortable earrings  Great little pair of very comfortable earrings. Great product, great price and fast delivery <end>  earring closure  the stones were very nice, but, the earring closure is not tight and secure.

I was looking for a pair of earrings to match my ring, and these were the perfect fit. <end>

 B000J4H712  Celebrity Pink Genuine Swarovski Crystal Dangling Silver Earrings ||	  Sparkling  These are lovely dainty sparkling earrings. Great for day or evening wear.Just wish the packaging said Swarovski Crystal. It would be more impressive whem giving as a gift. <end>  Awesome  I ordered this as a gift for a very nice friend, it arrived on time and my friend loved it. I would suggest you to make it possible to have this item gift-wrapped or should come with a gift note. Still, they made a quick shipping and that's what matters.  ) <end>  pretty, pink earrings  These earrings were also a Christmas gift. They are delicate, pink, dangling crystals....well made..a bargain for the price! <end>  Gorgeous  I have a necklace that matches these earrings so I am glad I found them.

 B000J4H7N0  Silver Drop Genuine Mother of Pearl Earrings ||	  The design is unique  Liked very much the unique design. The only thing is that the part that goes through the ear is very long. I plan on cutting off part of the length and smoothing the edge. But other than that, I really like them! <end>
 B000J4H85C  Sterling Silver Pink Genuine Sea Bamboo Coral Chip Earrings ||	  the color was like red  when i recieved it, the product was red not really pink either they sent the wrong ones or thats the color its really is <end>  not pink  these earrings are nothing like the picture. the are not chips, but rouned stones all around the same size and they look like they are dyed a dark red/orange. they will be fine for Christmas,., <end>  Yes, I agree - the color was red - earrings were also unequal lengths  I guess I doubted the review and figured why not take a chance for such a small amount of money. I wanted pink coral earrings to match a bracelet and figured if they were red they would match some jewelry with a bit of red coral. I don't think I could wear them because of the unequal lengths of the drop. You do get what you pay for. <end>
 B000J4H9UG  Vintage inspired Sterling Silver Four Circle Earrings ||	  Meh...  They're alright, but they're a lot smaller than I thought and they look and feel pretty cheap actually. <end>
 B000J4HAYG  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz Stone Oval LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  A Gift for a Friend  I have ordered these earrings for myself and loved them so much, I wanted to order them as a gift for my friend who loves blue topaz. The earrings came packaged so nicely that I only need to add a card. They are comfortable to wear and look terrific for the summer clothes but also would look great in any season. <end>
 B000J4HCN0  Sterling Silver Filigree Chandelier Earrings ||	  Great earrings, great service  The earrings are amazing. The picture doesn't do them justice. They are filigree work, very fine and detailed. They were about the size I expected and not heavy at all. Amazing product. I absolutely love them. <end>  Beautiful and Simple  I have worn these chandelier Earrings to several occasions. So simple and elegant. I have gotten many compliments on them. It's so versatile you can wear it just about any where. It looks great with your hair up or down. <end>  Nice construction but shade of silver makes them look cheaper than pictures indicate  They look like the picture for the most part, well constructed, but they are a real light silver which makes them look cheaper and doesnt really match my higher quality silver. <end>
 B000J4HDAC  Sterling Silver Murano Glass Red Oval Flower Millefiori Heart Earrings Valentine's Day ||	  Perfect!  I got these earrings as a Valentine's gift and love them. They are perfectly feminine and charming. I wear them all the time and get tons of complements on them! <end>
 B000J4HDIY  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst and Diamond Accent Hoop Earrings ||	  Amethyst and Diamond hoop earrings  The earrings are dressy but versatile. They seem to be well made. My only concern is the security of the catch. If the catch slips open they will fall right out. <end>
 B000J4IBFS  Silver Baby ELEPHANT CHARM Animal Cute ||	  JDex  I got this for my mom for Christmas for her charm bracelet as a token for my new baby. It came in a timely manner and as expected. <end>

 B000J4IBVC  .925 Silver AIR PLANE CHARM Jet COOL ||	  Adorable & Good Quality!  This is so small! I love it! I thought it was going to be bigger but I love that it's the size that it is. I bought it for my boyfriend because he's obsessed with airplanes and he put it on his keychain and loves it too. There is no back It's just empty but that's no problem. It's very good quality I believe and I dont regret my purchase at alll ( <end>  airplane pendant / charm sterling silver great product  I ordered four of these to make some special christmas presents for my sons teachers - my son loves airplanes! These were excellent quality, looked even nicer in person. They are not marked .925 and hollow underside. But very good quality and i would definitely buy them again. Very cute on silver chain or to add to a charm bracelet (although it has a closed ring, not a clip).Overall very impressed with this product and the price was very reasonable. <end>
 B000J4IC70  Beautiful! Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Genuine Green Jade Chinese Motif Pendant ||	  Buy At Your Own Risk!  I bought this pendant. It looks very cheap and after 2 days the glue that holds the written script in the middle fell off and the pendant started to fall apart. And some of the pieces weren't even gold. Not Worth It!!!!! <end>  Beautiful yet simple pendant  All I can say is this was MUCH nicer than expected and was greatly appreciated by the lady it was given to. It was shipped by normal freight and arrived in plenty of time. A perfect transaction in all respects. <end>  love  i am a lover of chinese jade! this was a beautiful piece. to me jade should be done in gold not silver & this piece is one of my favorites. <end>  Title completely misleading  After sending it to my boyfriend as a care package, which he loved by the way, and he got numerous compliments on " the gift he got from his girlfriend". Then receiving an email from him saying that the chain left a green ring around his neck when he swam with it in a lake, I am pretty sure they exaggerated the quality of this thing. I gave it two stars instead of one since Im assuming that the "gold over silver" is probably for the pendant only which is apparently beautiful, but I still feel like they should be more specific about their product. If they were I could have easily avoided such embarrasment by just buying a separate chain. Not a good deal! <end>  Great for teenagers  I got these for my nieces for Christmas. They absolutely loved them. A lot nicer than I was expecting, cool looking piece of jewelry for children/early teenagers. <end>
 B000J4II06  Sterling Silver Marcasite Genuine Garnet Heart Locket ||	  Pretty locket  I got this because my mom had got me one just like it years ago and I lost it. It's really pretty and I get compliments on it. I put it on a black cord because I like the look of it better.Thankfully I foud the one my mom got me so now I have two. <end>
 B000J4II24  Sterling Silver Marcasite & Genuine Garnet Heart Book Locket Pendant ||	  Vintage Beauty  This little locket is a beautiful peice of vintage beauty.The quality of the silver is good and it has some weightbehind it, not cheap at all. I really like the gothic/victoriandesign. It's a highly attractive eye catcher thatis as close to an authentic vintage peice as you can get.I put mine onto a 16 inch box chain which made thepeice pop far above the slight chain that it comes with.Great purchase!!!! <end>  Beautiful Locket  This is a stunning locket. Very delicate looking yet sturdy. Thought I would have to change the chain, but will keep it. I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Would highly recommend. <end>  Silver Marcasite and Garnet locket  I purchased this and the heart-shaped lockets to make presents for my daughters. The lockets are beautiful and have received many compliments.They arrived very quickly and the purchase went very smoothly.Thank you! <end>
 B000J4II4C  Sterling Silver Marcasite & Garnet Heart Locket Necklace, 18" ||	  Beautiful locket. Large.  Wanted to order a large heart pendant with red on it for my son's girlfriend last Christmas. Found a real nice looking one in a catalog I received but all the reviews said it was only about 1/2 inch in size so I looked online and found this one. It is about 1 inch in size and very pretty with a nice length chain (the other one sold without any chain sometimes or with a tiny, short one with other sellers. Anyway, she has had it for almost a year now, wears it ALL the time and it still looks great. Should have bought one for myself too! <end>
 B000J4II60  Sterling Silver CZ Cross Pendant ||	  pretty pendant  The pendant is very pretty. Slightly large but very pretty. The chain is very thin and will prob not last as long as the pendant - but I am very happy with the purchase! <end>
 B000J4II9C  Sterling Silver Bali Pendant with Genuine Peridot Stone ||	  Quality is outstanding  I purchased this for my best friend and was amazed by it's quality. It's gorgeous! The chain came with it (although it wasn't mentioned anywhere) and it was shipped quickly. There is nothing worse than ordering something for someone and having it delayed by shipping. It was neatly packaged and placed in a little blue "velvet" bag. Which made giving so much easier. I have purchased several items from this company and have only been disappointed once (when the item was replaced with something else). <end>  Get what you pay for...  Beautiful out of the package, I wore it for about two weeks before it tarnished badly enough to need cleaned. Owning sterling jewelry, I thought it was a little odd, as jewelry doesn't need polished that often when you wear it. So I used my silver jewelry cleaning cloth and was amazed to find the metal is NOT sterling, it's actually penny colored. Okay, to be honest there are a few specks of sterling... the east, west & south dots and the band surrounding & holding the stone are. I contacted the seller twice and have gotten NO response. It looks horrible, I am BUMMED. <end>  Beautiful and Nicely Made  I got this for one of my nieces. It's a beautiful necklace, well made, and she just loves it. All her aunts want one, or one like it. <end>
 B000J4IKAY  Sterling Silver Double Heart Created Pink Sapphire Heart Pendant ||	  pretty good  Bought as a gift for my little sis, from myself and my bro, her birthday is sept so sapphire is her birthstone.

 B000J4IL6W  Sterling Silver Bali Bead Genuine Picture Jasper Stone Oval Pendant ||	  Too small  Item was of good quality but much too small for my taste. I think more size description should be given. <end>
 B000J4ILA8  Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Genuine Blue Topaz Turtle Pendant ||	  Great quality.  The looks and the quality of this necklace was much better than expected. The turtle looks really neat and the chain was strong and good looking. My grand-daughter loved it. <end>
 B000J4INEM  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Created Fiery White Opal & Diamond Accent Past Present and Future Pendant and Stud Earrings Set ||	  Opal Pendant and Earings Set Review  The opals are quite fiery though on the small side. The settings are strong and stylish. This set is rather delicate but of a fine quality. I was after a longer chain, and will change it. The pendant sits just below the collar bone. I was hoping it would sit closer to the cleavage. <end>
 B000J4IQEY  Remarkable Sterling Silver Bracelet with Genuine Onyx Stones ||	  Onyx Delight  A bold statement without being chunky. Surprisingly light. The stones and silver are highly polished. Nicely made, good craftsmanship. Length 7 1/2", width 3/8". <end>

Definitely would recommend you buy from them  ) <end>
 B000J4IRRU  Sterling Silver Genuine Swarovski Crystal Stretch Bracelet ||	  Very striking.  This is a beautiful bracelet. I have a genuine Swarovski necklace that closely matches it and to get the bracelet from Swarovski, I would have paid more than an extra hundred dollars over what I paid for this bracelet. I'm so glad I didn't do that! What a waste of money that would have been! I highly recommend. <end>  dissappointed  Disappointted in this purchase, I bought this for a gift, but too embarrased to give it, I'll lets the kids play dressup with it, or just return it. <end>  Inexpensive, but beautiful.  I bought these as gifts for young ladies I know in Brazil. They are all into bracelets and seemed to be genuinely pleased with them. I thought they were beautiful and not too expensive. Good choice!! <end>
 B000J4IS0G  Stretch Turquoise Stone Chip Bracelet ||	  AWESOME!  Amazing! I was look for Turquoise, and there it was a fabulous piece and the price SPECTACULAR!I wear it everyday, I LOVE IT!! <end>  stretch turquoise stone chip bracelet  I am lovin this stuff, so much so I ordered more for myself and friends. will, no doubt, order more in the future too! The stretch is what makes it perfect for everyone <end>  Should Have Bought More Than One  This bracelet has a true turquoise color with some dark veining. The irregularly shaped stones give it an interesting look. At this price I should have bought more than one. <end>  great  I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction. <end>  Excellent bracelets and worth the money  I read the reviews and I had to give it to a bunch of girls in my family. I ordered 10 of these and it arrived in good packaging and on time. Everyone liked it and for the money, this is a great gift. If you are looking to distribute it for a large crowd, this is very affordable. The stones are attached to a stretchable rubber band. One size fits all. <end>  Great Gift Idea  These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit. Since they were so inexpensive, I was able to give everyone a gift. <end>  Christmas gift  My co-worker loved this gift and matching earring that came with the gift. It was reasonable and helped me to stay on budget. <end>  Nice little braclet  Compliments the earrings I purchased and looks nice with m6y denim shirts. Great little gift for someone or yourself. Inexpensive and comes in a nice little pouch. <end>  simple bracelet  This was my first turquoise bracelet,and worked quite well for me until I got one that is a little flashier. If you are wanting simplicity for your look this is perfect... just depends on what look you are putting together. <end>  Simple and Classy  Looking for a cheap but interesting gift for my eccentric friend, I decided to purchase two types of stone chip stretch bracelets. The Turqoise being one.It compliments my friend's wide array of trinkets, giving her another simple but interesting piece to collaborate with the others. A bit of polished stone is timelessly classy.A good purchase for the price; the shipping is more expensive than the item. Buy it on Amazon though, as other sites and stores charge a bit more for such a plain piece. <end>  Terrific Turquoise  This is a nice little bauble -- good color and a good match to the turquoise chip earrings. My wife may want to get more to combine them on her wrist for a more dramatic look, but I'm sure she is going to like this stocking stuffer on Xmas morning.One reviewer used it for office gifts -- a great idea for $ limit Secret Santa gift giving, or just as a small token of thanks for that favor someone did for you. At $2.99 you can stock up and be prepared. <end>
 B000J4IS1K  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz Stone and Genuine Diamond Accent S and Oval Tennis Bracelet ||	  Well worth it  My GF loved this.

She had just purchased a motorcycle and I thought this would be a nice accessory for her. I was right because she loved it and wears it frequently, even years later. <end>
 B000J4IS6U  Marcasite Turquoise Stone X O Sterling Silver Bracelet ||	  Bit Disappointed  Beautiful bracelet, but the catch on the bracelet doesn't close properly. Using a safety pin as safety catch until I can get to jeweler and have proper safety put in. Should work for money invested in this beautiful bracelet. Am a bit disappointed, but the bracelet itself is a lovely piece of marcasite and tourquois, my favorite stones. <end>
 B000J4IS9W  Sterling Silver Simulated Cubic Zirconia and Multi Color cz Tennis Bracelet ||	  Fun and Elegant  I love how the inner stones are off-center to add some fun to the piece, and the pastel colors are so pretty; with the clear cz stones in the outer frames the overall effect is elegant. I would like to add a white backing so the shapes and colors pop agains my skin as well as they do in the photograph - any suggestions re how to do this? <end>
 B000J4ISJC  Sterling Silver Bead Stretch Bracelet ||	  Bracelet  This is a really pretty bracelet. The size is perfect, not too small, which I was afraid of. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a gift and the packaging for it is kind of "cheap" looking. I was hoping for a pretty box and something that actually notes that it's sterling silver. <end>  Very cute  I love this little bracelet especially as it is quite inexpensive for something so pretty. <end>  CHEAP! FEELS LIKE PLASTIC EMBARESSED TO GIVE AS GIFT  I bought this bracelet based on positive reviews from Amazon, but there were only 4 or 5. I buy many of my purchases on Amazon because of their open, honest, reviews; Amazon even posts those reviews that support buying from other sites, such as Costco. I was looking for a replacement Sterling silver .925 beaded, quality bracelet that would replace her lost Silpada bracelet. This bracelet, in my opinion, could have come out of a "Cracker Jack Box". Certainly not worth the $30 with ship that I paid! The bracelet arrived within one week, but it feels and looks like plastic. Also some of the beads were sticking together and I had to pry them apart, like they were sprayed or something! When I shine a light inside of the beads it is white, not silver. And the weight is very light, I measure .2 oz or 6 grams which feels very light to me. Also, where is the .925 stamp that is advertised on the Amazon website? I would not recommend at all. It is going back... pronto!!! <end>  Great Bracelet  I love it! I think I've worn it every day since I got it! And it stood up to my 1 1/2 year old niece playing with it! <end>  PERFECTION AT IT'S BEST!  I originally purchased this exact bracelet on QVC, and paid almost twice the amount as the Amazon price! After wearing the original bracelet from QVC every day for 2 years without taking it off, I unfortunately got it caught in my door, and needless to say it was history. Beads were scattered about everywhere! I looked everywhere for the exact bracelet and could not find it anywhere but AMAZON!!!I finally have it back and I will never take it off again.This is a classic beauty that can be worn alone or with other bracelets. It is the sterling silver version of the PERFECT pearl bracelet! <end>
 B000J4ISME  Sterling Silver Simulated Tanzanite and Diamond Accent X and Oval Pattern Bracelet ||	  Not what I imagined, ONE microscopic diamond awkwardly placed  There was only ONE microscopic diamond awkwardly placed on one of the "x's" between the simulated stones. It wasn't even in the center of the "x." From the photo, it seems like there are many small diamonds on each "x." Guess you get what you paid for, and in the end the bracelet was too large, so the jeweler was instructed to omit that particular link. Pass it up if you're buying for the glitz of diamonds otherwise the simulated tanzanite is beautiful. <end>
 B000J4ISMO  Sterling Silver Beaded Purple Genuine Swarovski Crystal Cluster Bracelet ||	  Not Adult Size  Very disappointed in this purchase. It's much tinier than it appears. I gave it to a child instead of the adult I purchased it for. <end>
 B000J4ISTC  Genuine Faceted Onyx Stone 4mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  5 stars  I've had this bracelet for over a year and it hasn't lost its shape at all. Most bracelets tend to stretch out but this one has nice quality cord. The beads are very sparkly. <end>
 B000J4IW6G  Simulated Lavender Cats Eye Stone 8mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Lavender Cats Eye Bracelet  This is a nice bracelet, though it is a little darker than in the picture. Other than that it is on a thick stretch string, and doesn't look like it is going to stretch out or break off any time soon. I love how the cat's eye looks, and this piece is no exception. If you want a nice looking purple/pinkish bead braclet, this is the perfect item! <end>
 B000J4IW7K  Genuine Rose Quartz Stone 8mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Common, but cute  It's your pretty standard beaded elastic bracelet, but the elastic seems to be more durable than most of the others I've seen. The stones arrived in great shape, they're very pretty and seem like they're pretty good quality, as well. They've survived a couple days of active wear, to include the usual bumps, bangs and squishes.I would highly recommend purchasing these over your usual cheap-mall-store beaded bracelets. I'm very happy with my purchase. <end>  One of my favorite stones  Rose quartz is supposed to bring love and happiness . This bracelet is lovely. This bracelet if really nice. I really enjoy wearing this bracelet. <end>
 B000J4IW98  Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Thin Three Bangle Bracelet Set ||	  cheap!  I loved these when I first got them; I even ordered another pair. Fast forward a few months and they're starting to break because they're HOLLOW and also starting to change colors. This is just from normal wear and I don't wear them everyday. <end>
 B000J4IWEI  18K Gold over Sterling Silver CZ Square & Round Tennis Bracelet ||	  Every woman needs a little glitter in her life...  For a little glitter and glitz, this is perfect. The clasp keeps it safe on your wrist, and thecost makes it affordable. It is the perfect "fun" braclet, for dress up or just because.18K Gold over Sterling Silver CZ Square & Round Tennis Braceletby SilverSpeck.com <end>
 B000J4IWG6  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Sapphire & Diamond Accent Rectangle Link Bracelet ||	  DO NOT BUY THIS  This Product is awful. Thre are no "diamonds" in it, it is just silver metal. The ovals are not set in a straight line, and as soon as I opened it, it broke right at the middle hindge. The stones are not even close to sapphires, they are some kind of glass. Total misrepresentation, I am sending it back. <end>
 B000J4IWI4  18K Gold over Stelring Silver 13.20ct. TGW Garnet & Diamond Accent Tennis Bracelet ||	  Disappointing  The 24k gold over stirling silver is very pale and looks nothing like 24k.The product was received 7 days after the maximum shipping date.Very disappointed. <end>
 B000J4IXME  Sterling Silver 4mm Genuine Aventurine Stone Beaded Chain 15-19" Necklace ||	  This and three others perfect!  I bought four of the 15-19" necklaces from Amazon--two genuine stones and two simulated stones--and all four came just as pictured and described (beautifully vivid colors). The necklaces hang even, the beading is secure, and the lobster clasps are easy to use. They are exactly what I wanted. Thank you SilverSpeck and Amazon! <end>  Better than a silver chain  This necklace matched the aventurine charms on my bracelet perfectly. The 4mm beads were just the right size for my pendant slide. <end>
 B000J4IY5K  Sterling Silver 8mm Genuine Rose Quartz Stone Bead Beaded Chain 16-19" Necklace ||	  better than pink pearls  I ordered this necklace to go with my pink accessories with a black and white dress. matched my other accessories perfectly as the color shown in image is very close to the real color. The neckalace itself is much more beautiful in hand, as it is made of quartz stone and has some weight to it, so it suspends on the neck elegantly. I received lot of complements for it just by wearing it once. It is the perfect replacement for the pearl look without real pearls. <end>
 B000J4J17A  Sterling Silver Bali Chandelier earrings with Turquoise beads ||	  earrings  The earrings I rec'd were not these ones pictured, mine have an extra layer dropping down. Not bad, just different, depends on what you want. The device to secure them in your ear is difficult to set & I wonder about the durability in the long run. am debating returning... <end>  Not what I ordered  What is shown in the picture and what I received were two completely different items. The second view looks like someone airbrushed off the rest of the earring to give a "close up" which looks more like the item I received. Sorely, sorely disappointed.I will not be ordering from this supplier in the future. <end>  Sterling Silver & Turquoise Bali Chandelier Earrings  The earrings are lovely. However, they are very, very difficult to put on. Nearly impossible, in fact! You will need 15 to 20 minutes to get the job done. So either get up early for work, put them on the night before or have someone help you. It is a shame because they are really nice earrings.Sterling Silver Bali Chandelier earrings with Turquoise beads <end>  happy  I was so happy with the product and service I would deal again with the company. <end>
 B000J4J1FW  Sterling Silver Dangling Genuine Dark Blue Swarovski Crystal Earrings ||	  Beautiful darkish blue silver earrings  I received these earrings yesterday. They look just like the picture, but the lighting is not showing that they are a little lighter, not by much, then what I expected they are still very pretty. I was impressed with these earrings and I would suggest to anyone who likes Swarovski Crystal and Sterling? Silver you will really like them. The quality is great for the price. I am very impressed and happy to have them. I would recommend them to anyone! They also were sent so fast, I was amazed and quite happy about that too. Have fun owning a pair. I plan on wearing these a lot.  ) <end>  Much nicer in person!  I bought these for my Matron of Honor. I thought they were going to look childish, but they turned out very pretty! <end>
 B000J4J2TC  Sterling Silver CZ 40mm Hoop Earrings ||	  Look good but difficult to clasp  I like how these look, but they are difficult to clasp when you put them on. They're also easy to bend because the metal is pretty thin. <end>
 B000J4J35A  Genuine Green Turquoise Chip Earrings ||	  very cute  I got these turquoise earrings to go with my turquoise necklace and bracelet I also got from SilverSpeck. The earrings are not, too, big and not, too, small they are just right for me. I love green turquoise and sterling silver. the shipping was fast got to my door in several days.I highly recommend SilverSpeck 100%. <end>  Very nice for the price.  I really like these earrings. The price was very reasonable. They look cute with casual clothes and just the right size too. <end>  Pretty!!!!!  I gave as a gift and it was received with enthusiasm! The color is true and the workmanship very good. <end>
 B000J4J44U  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz Stone Bali Bead Oval LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz Stone Bali Bead Oval LeverBack Lever Back Earrings  These are terrific. I wish they were slightly darker blue, but I wear them often. I would definitely get more items similar to these. <end>
 B000J4J4H2  Sterling Silver Genuine Tiger Eye and Reconstituted Turquoise Chip Earrings ||	  Pleased with purchase  These are absolutely gorgeous! Bought them to color complement one of my outfits, but on its own it is very attractive. It looks better real than on the display. Can't wait to use them. <end>  A++  Very well made, beautiful, and very affordable. These earrings are a great addition to my jewelry collection. I recommend this purchase. <end>  Nice  Great price for this stone earring. I like the combination of the two stones. Great for casual wear with denim outfits. <end>  Just like in the photo  These are so pretty, just like they do in the photo. Shipping was faster than I expected. Each pair of earrings came with a dark blue velvet bag. And you can't beat the price. I'm very pleased! <end>  I like it !  Good looking. Great value and quality. Keep well in the ear. Longer than I expected, but it is not a real problem. <end>
 B000J4J5LM  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz Stone Teardrop LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Pale and pretty  When I first received these earrings in the mail, I was confused--I couldn't remember ordering any earrings that looked like diamonds. It took me a minute to remember that I'd ordered blue topaz, and to see the pale blue shining in these drop earrings. It reminds me of sea glass made from old Coke bottles, but a bit more faint. The drop is almost the size of a #2 pencil eraser. Overall, I've decided I like them, even though I was expecting something more colorful. <end>  just the right size  These are very pretty very light blue earrings that are good for everyday wear. Not too cheap looking although for only $10 you can't go wrong either way! <end>
 B000J4J850  18K Gold over Sterling Silver CZ 6mm Triangle Stud Earrings ||	  So many compliments when I wear them.  I ordered these sometime back in the Summer and I was afraid they would not be as pretty as they looked on the site....Best purchase I have made for myself. I've been hiding them from my oldest daughter but I will get her a pair for Xmas. They are gorgeous and a day never goes by when all I get is compliments about them and how they look. Thanks again Amazon, 1 happy shopper here and now you will have my family ordering too...Judy M <end>
 B000J4J88W  18K Gold over Stelring Silver Sapphire & Diamond Accent Oval Half Hoop EarringsEarrings ||	  cute  I was expecting some ugly sapphires but i was wrong...i mean they are not the best but they r worth the money...however there i one ugly diamond on one side of each earring and then the vermeil is carved to look like a diamond...not bad for a everyday pair of earrings. <end>
 B000J4J8WS  18K Gold over Sterling Silver CZ 5mm Heart Stud Earrings ||	  Very small, but nice for the price.  They are very small. You can't tell if you're wearing them that they are heart-shaped. But if you need a cute pair of everyday earrings, like for a second piercing in your ear..these are great. Good quality, they haven't discolored or anything. They look nice. I just wish they were a bit bigger. Fast delivery, good price. <end>
 B000J4JQXE  ST GEORGE ROSARY BLACK BEAD ||	  Very handsome Rosary.  I got this as a gift for a young man who asked me to be his sponsor for his Confirmation, who picked George as his Confirmation name after St. George who is the patron saint of the Boy Scouts. It is a very nice and very handsome Rosary; great quality and size as well. Perfect for men, but very beautiful for women as well. <end>
 B000J4KB88  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Created Pink Sapphire & Diamond Accent Rectangle Link Bracelet ||	  Excellent Product 5-Stars!  I recently bought this beautiful bracelet for my girlfriend for our 2 year anniversary. It came just as it looks in the picture and the Pink Sapphire stones shine quite nicely. My girlfriend was ecstatic when she saw it and she has been wearing it non stop. The clamp is very tight so there's no worry about it loosening and coming off and the gold overlay is very pretty and has not come off a bit even though she showers with it. Overall the bracelet is an excellent gift that is very beautiful and great for its price. <end>
 B000J4KBGA  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Marquise Cut CZ Tennis Bracelet ||	  she loved it  My wife saw this on line so I ordered it. She loved it! It's nicer than pictured. She's a big tennis fan and will wear this a lot. <end>

 B000J4KC1Y  Sterling Silver Chunky Puzzle Link Necklace ||	  Jigsaw Necklace  It is a great necklace and only took 5 days to get from the states to here in oz. Bloody bonza work from amazon. Bloody bueaty of a necklace. My missus loved it. Highly recommend buying from amazon. <end>
 B000J4KCUA  Sterling Silver 6mm Genuine Faceted Onyx Stone Bead Beaded Chain 15-19" Necklace ||	  Great buy!  This is a really pretty necklace. So sparkly. Looks nice and sturdy. Perfect length and size of onyx beads! <end>
 B000J4KG5G  Sterling Silver Square Simulated Aquamarine CZ Stud Earrings ||	  could be painful  I do like these. The only problem is that they don't quite fit through the holes of my ear. They almost fit so I could shove them through and endure a little pain, but I'm not quite sure if I'm that brave. <end>
 B000J4KGMY  Sterling Silver 4mm Round Genuine Peridot Stud Earrings ||	  earring  Stones are nice but the posts had rough spots that I had to clean off to keep from snagging in my ears. Once removed it appears that the silver is only a coating. <end>
 B000J4KHBO  Sterling Silver Genuine Peridot 4mm Round Stud Earrings - August Birthstone ||	  Nice  These look great on. They are not large but you can see the color. They work great in my kitchen work. Thanks for a great product at a good price. <end>  Way too tiny.  I got this item for a gift for my sister and they seem to be a good size in the picture but when they came they we're smaller then an earring back. <end>
 B000J4KHPA  Sterling Silver Round Simulated CZ Leverback Lever Back Earrings ||	  Gorgeous earrings  I love those earrings. They are elegat and the right size. I get lots and lots of compliments. Thinking of buying a backup pair. Have some trouble with the shipping at first but the company solved fast. Great customer service. I highly recommended. Usualy I don't writte reviews because I am a slow typer, but I am so happy with the earrins that I decided to do it. I have several earrings ordered from Amazon but this pair have the best appearance, even thei are not expensive. <end>
 B000J4KI9K  Sterling Silver Oval Genuine Sapphire Stone Prong Set LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Not Good.  Maybe the saphire part was okay - good color. But, these earrings fell apart after one wearing. I don't recommend them. <end>  Good 'everyday' earrings  Sapphire is my birthstone. I have an expensive oval sapphire pendant that I can never find 'matching' earrings for..so I was happy when I found these. I can wear them together with my necklace, and you'd never know the difference in cost in my set. They are great for 'everyday', not too fancy, but still pretty! They cost nothing, and the stone is a darker blue, like a true sapphire. Too often the lab created stones look so obviously fake. It says they are geniune stones, I'm not sure how for only $10.00, it is a nice sized stone. Regardless, the quality is still good with a solid setting. The Leverback makes them secure, which is great. I always lose earrings. I highly recommend! <end>
 B000J4KIHM  Sterling Silver Genuine Green Jade Stone Oval LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Jade earrings  Really cute little earrings. Perfect size for everyday wear. Lever backs are sturdy. Would buy from this seller again. (Actually, I have bought from this seller many times before, and have never been disappointed.) <end>  Gorgeous and classic  Love these earrings. They are well made and strong. The jade is stunning and is great when I wear black as the green really pops out. These are quality earrings and will last a lifetime as the style is simple and classic. <end>  sterling genuine jade lever back earrings  These earrings are very pretty. They are a beautiful shade of jade. They are the perfect size and very feminine. I was pleased with my purchase. I would purchase them for a gift The price was very fair for this product. I received my order within two days and, was happy with how fast it was delivered. The earrings were packaged carefully to prevent damage. I am a satisfied customer and I would order jewelry from Amazon again. <end>  Love these.  I really love these earrings. I wear them constantly. They are light and comfortable. The hook stays in place securely. The metal doesn't itch, ok that's weird but I get so allergic when the hooks are not genuine sterling. The stones are a lovely pale jade that goes with quite a few colors. I love them. <end>  Junk  Received these earrings and found that one was noticeably bigger than the other. Can't wear them because one hangs down twice as low at the other. I won't ever buy anything else from this seller. <end>  Great deal!  These jade earrings are so beautiful. My only complaint was that the stone in one earring is a little loose. I'm sure it would cost nothing to have it tightened. Even with the cost of that, these are worth it. The lever backs are sturdy and well made. Who doesn't love jade? Gorgeous! <end>  Dainty but substantial!  These earrings are a great buy and they are beautiful on. They look a lot more expensive than what I paid for them. I get many compliments and they are the perfect pair that go with anything from daytime to evening wear. <end>  Sterling Silver Genuine Green Jade Stone Errings  Great quality and delivery was quick. My wife absolutely loved these Jade Errings. price was GOOD too. Can't buy these for what I paid for them and get the quality I got. Highly recommend these errings. <end>
 B000J4KIOK  Sterling Silver Emerald & CZ Flower Stud Earrings ||	  Emerald Earrings  I got these earrings for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She loves Emeralds & I believe this is her birthstone as well. The earrings are pretty.  ) <end>  Pretty, but ...  No way are they real emeralds. They're absolutely clear and flawless, which you just don't get for this sort of price.I would have preferred the post to be centered rather than at the top of the earring. When they're not centered, the earring rotates on the earlobe and looks odd when they don't match on both ears. <end>
 B000J4KITA  Sterling Silver Dark Green cz Square Stud Earrings ||	  great color earrings!  The green CZ in these earrings is stunning. The silver earring itself is great quality and sturdy. The larger size stone makes them stand out. Now I want more colors and at this price, I could get them all. Totally worth every single penny. Get some! <end>
 B000J4KLYM  Sterling Silver cz Small Mini Yin Yang Chinese Symbol Kid Stud Earrings ||	  Lovely, except...  These earrings are adorable. Too bad they look nothing like the picture. At all. The earrings I received were domed and had no crystal elements, as opposed to the flat-topped earrings in the picture. <end>
 B000J4KM6O  Sterling Silver Filigree Three Graduating Heart Earrings ||	  Simple & nice  I bought this earring to match with the filigree heart pendant. It's small but good enough for a small build like me. It shiny & smooth but fine details within the heart shape is hard to see unless you scrutinise it closely. Should have the design in bigger size. Overall, it's simple & nice. <end>
 B000J4KMPK  Sterling Silver Designer Swirl Hoop mini Earrings ||	  Sterling Silver Designer Swirl Hoop mini Earrings Review  I have had many complements since I started wearing these earrings, so many women seem to like them, I was a little surprised at how large they are though since they're called mini earrings, I'd have said more a medium sized hoop, however that's beside the point, they look great and are very comfortable. <end>
 B000J4KMS2  18K Gold over Sterling Silver 35mm Filigree Hoop Earrings ||	  Pretty hoop earrings  This is a good purchase as long as you know what to expect for the cost. The earrings are large, detailed, and look great on. The workmansship is OK, not great, but still definitely a good value. This is a nice piece of fashion jewelery. <end>
 B000J4MG0O  Sterling Silver 8mm Genuine Faceted Onyx Stone Bead Beaded Chain 16-19" Necklace ||	  Black and Beautiful  This necklace is so elegant and can be worn both casual and formal.Great purchase at a great price. <end>
 B000J4MJ9C  Sterling Silver CZ Three Strand Chandelier Earrings ||	  Cheap looking  Although these are sterling silver, they are very light weight, so they do not hang well, making them look cheap. The strands are linked by very small chains so they don't move/dangle and even get stuck sideways instead of straight down, again making them look cheap. Needless to say, I returned them. I guess you have to buy the real thing... sigh. <end>  Not Quite  The dangles are poorly made and are very stiff. while trying to adjust, one of the stones fell out. Super glued it back in and still wore them. They look nice though. (I had a matching necklace) <end>
 B000J4MJG0  Sterling Silver Genuine Carnelian Chip Earrings ||	  did I order these?  Yes, they are small, but what I got and what's in the picture are not even close! My earrings are all orange stones with none of the lovely shading that enticed me to order them. Talk about being disappointed, that's an understatement. Too bad, so sad, I've been had. <end>  Pretty  I wanted chipped earrings with just the stones and no fancy design and I finally found it here. I bought rose quartz, smokey quartz and carnelian chipped earrings and they are all worth it. Reasonably priced and good quality. <end>
 B000J4MJJW  Sterling Silver Lavender Cubic Zirconia round Stud Earrings ||	  Refreshingly Colored Earrings  Lavender is one of my favorite colors, so I was drawn to these earrings immediately. It is rare to find lavender stones, and these earrings are such a refreshing shade of lavender, every bit as lovely as they look in the photo. They are also elegant  round and not too big, though big enough to show up easily if you happen to have long hair. I love these earrings; they have become one of my favorite pairs in my big collection. <end>
 B000J4MJRE  Sterling Silver Pink Cubic Zirconia and Cubic Zirconia Heart Square Stud Earrings ||	  so cute  Bought those for christmas and i'm in love with them they are my new favorite studs <end>
 B000J4MJSI  Sterling Silver Briolette Pink Cats Eye Heart Earrings ||	  Very ugly earrings  Really dislike the way these earrings look and sit in the ear. No way I would have purchased if seen in person. But I can't fault the listing or seller, it's my own fault. <end>
 B000J4MJT2  Sterling Silver Genuine Diamond and Ruby Hoop Earrings ||	  nice jewelry  The silver is very good quality, same as the stones.. only the rubies are a bit lighter colour than the picture, and one earring doesn't close perfectly, but that's not a real problem! But the earrings do look nice! <end>  Lovely, but small  I bought the earrings to go with the matching necklace, but alas, the earrings are also too small for me. These are very petite and &#34;hugger&#34; style. Fast shipping though. <end>  earrings  absolutely love this product, but wish I could find a bracelet to match this set, I found a great ring, stud, & necklace set to match from a different seller. <end>  Better than thought  For the price I figured that the product would be cheap and cheesy looking. I was amazed at the quality of this product. I bought the earrings for my daughter but after seeing the product have decided that I want a pair for myself as well. I love them and will recommend the product and company to any and all. <end>  doesn't look like rubies  I should have paid attention to the other review. These stones are very light almost pink. I loves the sapphire ones but am really disappointed in these. The diamonds are nice and for the price they are okay earrings. Since they are so inexpensive, I won't return them. After I pay shipping again, it's not worth it. But I won't buy from the company again. <end>
 B000J4MK0K  Genuine Mother Of Pearl & Pink Shell Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  But how heavy are they?  I wish the site would specify the weight of each earring. I like these and others here, but I won't buy them without knowing their weight. If they are too heavy, they hurt. <end>
 B000J4MKM8  Sterling Silver and Genuine Abalone Starfish Earrings ||	  Absolutely darling...  I love these, they are light weight, well made, and the design is darling. They are just plain fun. I have had so many compliments on them. <end>
 B000J4MKNW  Sterling Silver Genuine Mother of Pearl & CZ Heart Shaped Earrings ||	  A wonderful look !  These are very pretty.......the mother of pearl contrasts nicely with the silver. Not too heavy on the earlobe. <end>
 B000J4MKQY  Sterling Silver Intertwining Three Hoop Earrings ||	  Kind of disappointed  I bought these for a gift and was surprised to find them much smaller than I expected. Plus, the links were pretty shabily made (you can see the seam and the links aren't smooth -- they almost look coated). I was pretty disappointed. I've bought several other things from SilverSpeck which were much nicer and much better made, for a lot less money. Alas, I'm returning these. On a plus note - when I called SilverSpeck to return them (even tho more than 30 days had passed) - the guy was very helpful and just told me to send in the exchange info. Kudos on the customer service! <end>
 B000J4MLUO  Sterling Silver Genuine Freshwater Cultured Pink Pearl LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Pearl too small ......  These are pretty earrings, but the pearl is much smaller than I expected. <end>
 B000J4MMG2  Sterling Silver CZ Half Hoop Earrings ||	  They are AWSOME!  They are perfect. Just what I was looking for. I love them so much I ordered two more pairs  ) <end>
 B000J4MN52  Sterling Silver 2ct Blue Topaz & Diamond Accent Oval Drop Stud Earrings ||	  Happy Overall  I have just received my new earrings and so far I love them. The stone is really pretty and the stem of the earing is quite long which I personally like because the earring will stay on tight without coming close to pinching my ear. I bought these to use as my everyday earrings and needed something sterling silver so my ears wouldn't get infected. These are perfect so far. I did see one other review that said the earrings broke. I will post an update if they do indeed break. <end>  Perfect Present  I bought these for my fourteen year old niece who love loved loved them. They are made well and look very expensive. She was thrilled when she opened her gift and wears them almost every day! I have been told that I am, "the best aunt ever!" <end>  dime store quality  Bought these in amethyst as a gift. Complete JUNK. They looked pretty enough, but as soon as they had been opened, and my giftee went to try them on, the post broke right off! I was embarrassed to say the least! If that wasn't enough, a packaging list wasnt included, so I am unable to even return them. Don't waste your money like I did. <end>  Not bad!  The earring are nice for the price, I like them. The gems are shiny and light blue in color. I think these earrings will look much better without the diamond post. The diamonds are tiny, dull in color and barely noticeable. <end>  Broke  I bought this pair of earrings for my daughters birthday, and was very happy when I got them. I gave them to her and she went to put them on and the post broke, she was really sad....would not recomend them to anyone..... <end>

 B000J4MQBI  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Genuine Emerald and Diamond Accent Hoop Earrings ||	  Emerald & Diamond Access Hoop Earrings  While the stones of these earring are beautiful and the quality good, the posts of the earrings are too thick for a normal pierced ear, causing discomfort, which makes these earrings unwearable. <end>  i can not wear it  the earings are beautiful and attractive, but i can wear it because the posts are too thick. my ear got bleeding when try to put it in. <end>  Earrings  The earrings arrived in a few days and I gave them as a gift. The receiver liked them very much <end>
 B000J4MR26  18K Gold over Sterling Silver 18mm Hoop Earrings ||	  Good for the price.  These earrings look very nice. I was a little worried that my ears would react badly because they're very sensitive. Not the case, I've been wearing them all day with no problem. The 'hinge' system seems a little iffy and I'm not sure how long they'll hold out. However, I do like them and they are definately worth the $7.99 I paid. My order arrived in only 3 days. Thanks silverspeck! <end>
 B000J4NAGS  ST FLORIAN ROSARY BLACK BEAD ||	  very cheap quality  I ordered this item and believed it would be very nice quality. I was wrong. The beads are wooden and the black color is coming off some of these. The St. Florian medal is simply glued behind the medal of the Mother. The Crucifix is very slim and low quality also. All in all for the price this is a big disappointment. <end>
 B000J5MMDO  Beautiful Three Tier Earrings ||	  Beautiful Three Tier Earrings  My favorite earrings! Complete style and comfortable. The gemstones are genuine (sterling silver and real gemstones, imagine that).Kathy's attention to detail really shows in this design. <end>
 B000J63IQI  Sterling Silver Blue & Clear CZ Rectangle Contemporary Men's Cufflinks ||	  Good value for the money  I received lots of compliments. These look great with white as well as pastel colored cuffed shirts. Very elegant in appearance. Though, they seem a bit delicate and are smaller in size than I expected. <end>
 B000J68AI4  Long Silver Toned Locket Necklace ||	  The packaging was nicer than the product.  When I ordered this locket, I expected to receive a beautiful, antique-looking locket, that looked the same in the picture as it did in my hand. I was extremely disappointed. The locket itself is made of cheap, thin metal. The "antique" effect is just black paint in the creases. It appears as if the locket was dipped in motor oil, but not thoroughly cleaned. The chain is almost as bad. It is very bulky, much larger than it looks in the picture. AND the chain broke seconds after I got it out of the package (although the package was quite nice). To prospective buyers, don't waste your money. This necklace belongs in the garbage can, end of story. <end>
 B000J6BS74  Silver CZ Heart Charm Earrings ||	  not what expected  These earrings are so small not what I expected. I also don't like the way they latch. Not happy. <end>
 B000J6DH4Q  14KYG Diamond Dangle Earrings ||	  Diamond girl  These earrings are very nice. I like the flexabilty in this dangleand the diamonds may be small but the sparkle is large.For me theyare fun to wear. <end>
 B000J6YFXI  1 3/4", 45mm Diameter.3.0mm Thick. Hoop Earrings. 4.70 Grams of Sterling Silver. . ||	  Damaged  I am not sure if this seller has no quality control in place, or what, but these earrings arrived damaged. They had scratches/gouges on them and what looked to be dripped metal. They were not polished or shiny. I contacted the seller 3 times and never received a response. I filed an Amazon A-Z Claim and was refunded. I do not recommend this product or the seller.P.S. Unfortunately, you have to give an item at least one star. Too bad, because sometimes the items do not deserve any stars! <end>
 B000J9X7DE  3/4" (19mm) Small Sterling Silver 2.0mm Thick Endless, Hoop ,Earrings. 1.54 Grams of Sterling Silver. ||	  Cute  Those are cute. I wish they were bigger, but for the price, I'd get them again. The shipping cost a lot though for something so light. <end>
 B000J9Z3I6  Pugster 316l Surgical Steel Silver Fairy Pink Crystal Gem Belly Button Ring Navel Piercing Bar Body Jewelry ||	  wonderful  This was suppose to be a gift for me from my son. Well I ended up buying my own gift. I love it. the package was wonderful. top quality. I;m totally pleased. Most likely buy more things from this company. My son likes this kind of jewerly. <end>
 B000JBZIAC  Pugster 316l Surgical Steel Belly Button Ring Heart Bling Sapphire Color Belly Rings ||	  Ewww  Really big and gaudy and the gemstones fell out in the box before I even had a chance to put it in. Not worth the price!!! <end>
 B000JC1B8O  Pugster Vintage Antique Silver Tone Floral May Birthstone Flower Green Beauty Cameo Lady Maiden Profile Emerald Green Swarovski Crystal Brooches And Pins ||	  snowflake pin ...expected more  Nice size and nice snowflake pattern but it looks to me like they just sprinkled glitter over the brooch....I expected crystals..If pin has them I can not see them....Very fast shipping.. <end>
 B000JCAO2S  PalmBeach Jewelry 18k Yellow Gold over Sterling Silver Two-Tone Elephant Ring ||	  Beautiful ring  The ring looks just like the picture, nice and shiny! It is lightweight but doesn't seem to compromise it's integrity. The only issue I have is my size 7 fits rather large (fits the same as my size 8 ring, solid silver with single gold elephant, bought from the same company). Great ring! <end>  joyce  Wow..what a surprise this was. The ring is of high quality and great looking. If you love elephants as I do this is the ring. <end>  Not worth it  The ring is nothing like the picture. Too light, not as smooth, not as beautiful. <end>
 B000JCYZ5A  Amazon.com  Beachcombers! Ethnic Indian Glass Bangle Bracelet Of The Month Club With Bangle Stand &amp; Bonus  Clothing ||	  awesome products, great service  This company's products are beautiful and unusual and make terrific and affordable gifts. I've bought several bangle combinations and have been very pleased with every selection. I've also bought three pairs of shoes and they are just exquisite. The service is friendly and quick. The people couldn't be nicer. Five stars all the way. The bangles are breakable yes, but they aren't meant to be family heirlooms. They are inexpensive enough that if you break one or two, it's no big deal. The owners give you a few extra because they know this will happen. The bangles are glass, afterall, but they are beautiful and really fun to wear on a night out. Candace <end>
 B000JD06GQ  Sterling Silver Red Enamel Children's Heart Pendant, 14" ||	  lovely  I've never purchased jewelry on-line before and I'm not disappointed with this purchase. The necklace is delicate and beautiful but tough enough for a child to wear. I purchased as a gift for my godchild and should have purchased more for all the girls. It is SO lovely. <end>  child's heart pendant 14"  This is such a lovely red enamal heart, that I took it off the small chain for a child and put it on a long chain for me and I love it!!!!! the small chain went to a child....so everyone is happy. The heart is bright and beautiful............fast service too. <end>  Striking color  The red enemal heart pendant is strking red in color. It is a perfect size for a child. An adult could wear this pendant as well. <end>
 B000JD06HA  Freshwater Cultured Pearl Pastel Stretch Bracelet ||	  Very Nice Pearls in Lustrous, Soft Tones  The pearls are clear, soft pastels and luminous whites with excellent luster and thick nacre. Yes, the bracelet is a bit loose in fit if you have small wrists as I do, but many women prefer looser cuff bracelets. It isn't likely to fall off the arm given its substance. The individual pearls are in the 7-8mm range, and as pictured, they're strung in five rows. It's a comfortable piece that could be restrung easily if necessary. In fact, there are enough pearls to have this restrung into a single strand choker and bracelet. The colors are what make the piece special. There are light to mid grays, mauves, peach tones, pale golden yellows--very feminine shades to match many colors in clothing. <end>  Very loose  A pretty bracelet that would go with most dresses or suits due to the various colors in it. I thought it would be snug as it's "stretchy", but it's not a tight fit. Slides up and down your arm. <end>
 B000JD06HU  Dyed Pastel Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace, 72" ||	  Fun, Flirty, Feminine Pearls for a Pearl Lover  This necklace is very versatile and the pearls are incredible! They're about 7-8mm in size, mostly oval in shape, with rich luster in gorgeous pastel shades of gray, peach, mauve, golden yellow and white. The 72" length is fun and flirty. I can wear it doubled with a slinky tank dress or layered Coco Channel style with a twinset; it can dress up jeans or relax a suited look. The price is great for the amount of freshwater pearls that are handknotted between each pearl. It's the perfect gift for a "pearl girl" who's relaxed and playful... or just for the young-at-heart. <end>
 B000JD2614  Sterling Silver Heart Dangle Earrings ||	  Nice --But Look Different Than Pictured  These earrings are cute but they are not what I expected. From the picture it looks like they are almost two-toned. I thought half of the heart would be shiny and the other half would be a darker silver--that's why I bought them. They are actually a solid very shiny silver. They also appear thicker and a bit rounded in the picture but they are actually pretty flat and thin. Very cute and nice but not at all what I thought I was buying. The did arrive in a timely manner and nicely packaged. I'll give them a 4 out of 5 because of the deceptiveness of the picture. <end>  Sterling Earings  The earings were a big hit, as they were a valentine gift. When the light hits they really pop. The recipient could not say enough nice things about them, so I figure a five star rating is the best I could give to the product. Thank you for this really neat find. <end>  love it  Very highly polished. Light reflects nicely from surfaces, nice movement in slight dangle. I have worn them every day since they arrived. very pleased with purchase. <end>  A gift for me!  I have been waiting for these to go on sale for the longest time. I bought the matching necklaceSterling Silver Triple Heart Drop Pendant, 18"quite a while ago and really wanted the matching earrings. I received them just in time to wear them for Valentines Day and I love them! I received several compliments from friends asking if it was a new set and where I bought them. Unfortunately the necklace is no longer in stock, but I still recommend the earrings and it shouldn't be too much of a problem to find something sold here on Amazon to wear with them <end>  Reminds Me of Costume Jewelry  This is a nice set of earrings for a reasonable price. However, on the backside of the earrings, the words "Made In Thailand" are stamped in letters large enough to easily read. While the earrings will hang so as to conceal this gaudy stamp most of the time, it will become noticeable over the course of the day.This product could have been an exceptional buy, but the tasteless stamping on the back of the earring itself makes this reminiscent of a child's play jewelry. <end>  Eh not what I expected  (  I got the earrings today and they don't look at all like in the picture in fact they look cheaper than what I paid for so disappointed <end>  EARRINGS  I GOT THEM FOR THE WIFE AND SHE LOVES THEM. I WILL LOOK FOR MORE OF THIS STYLE IN THE FUTURE. <end>  Pretty, but not heart- like!  Very pretty , but quite flat and look more like leaves than hearts! Very shiny - think I will enjoy them! <end>  Earrings  I had these on my wish list for a long time and finally ordered them. In the picture they look much more substancial then they really are. They are super light and flimsy, and would be better for a small child, not an adult earring! <end>  SS HEART EARRINGS  These earrings are just perfect-in size, sparkle and design. I would recommend to anyone who loves the heart shape dangle. <end>  Silver Heart Earrings say "I love you"  I ordered these earrings for my best friend's birthday. She loved them when she opened the package, and wears them all the time. They can be worn for casual or dressy. Silver goes with everything !!! <end>  Very nice earrings  I got these earrings as part of the Mother's Day gifts for my wife. They look very nice and my wife was quite happy with them. <end>  earrings  i absolutely LOVE these earrings. i especially like the style of the hook and the way they stay in place without need of the little rubber stoppers. they are great. i wish i could find more like them. <end>  Agree with most.........  These earrings DO move very nicely and catch a lot of light. However, for the price, they ARE quite thin. I was expecting a much heavier pair for the price. <end>  Sterling Silver Heart Dangle Earrings  These earrings are very pretty, just thought they would be a little heavier, but overall happy with the order and the price was good. They were packaged well and came on time. <end>  Pretty, but not like the picture.  I do like these earrings. The only thing I warn about is they are not like the picture. They are not two toned, and they are quite thin. However, catches the light and pretty - just not well depicted in the picture. <end>  Not What It Looks On Display Image!  Well, I purchased it for my wife thinking it was 2-shaded earrings[as looked in the picture]. However, it's plain sterling silver. It's bent from the middle that gives a shade in some conditions. Moreover, it's extremely thing and the doesn't worth the money! <end>  Beautiful earrings  These are such pretty earrings. The metal has depth to the color and the do not color the skin or cause infections like some metal earrings do <end>  Very nice  I have actually bought two pair of these.. they are very nice, I gave them to my wife as a gift, she ended up losing one after a while, I liked them too much for her not to have another pair! very nice! <end>  Absolutely beautiful!  What a pleasant surprise! The picture cannot do justice to these adorable earrings. They are shiny and just the right size. They can be worn with anything. A great everyday earring or look great with dressier clothes. Because of this and all of the compliments I have received, they are great as a gift. I have since bought some for my daughter-in-laws and they thought I spent a lot more money than I actually did. I highly recommend these for everyone. <end>  pretty for a small gift...  bought them as a gift for my wife, she liked them pretty much, small and cute. great item as an informal gift or can be bought togather with other stuff like pendants or bracelets. delivered quickly and in a very elegant jewelry box. <end>  Dangle earrings  I Bought these for my wife for Christmas and she loves them. She wears them all the time and like to wear them when we go out. I like how shiny and 'rich' looking they are. I'm really glad I got thrm for her. <end>  Great gift  I was looking for a Christmas gift for my other half here and came across the Amazon combination of these earings and necklace with the sliding open heart. I knew this was it, bought the combo and they were a hit with her.The earings seem fairly solid, made very well and are of good quality. I give them 4 stars out of 5 because they seem a little pricey for what they are. For the most part very good earings. <end>  Great small gift idea!  I bought these for a small gift for my girlfriend on valentine's day. They were a huge hit with her and she wears them all the time. Great value! <end>
 B000JD4XXS  Sterling Silver Multi-Square Double Chain Pendant, 16" ||	  Beautiful, perfect.  I convinced my boyfriend to purchase this necklace as a Christmas gift for his Godmother. Now that it's come in, I'm thinking about buying one for myself! It is a really lovely piece, everything you would expect from the pictures and more. The photo doesn't show it well, but the necklace has a "double chain" that adds lots of personality to it. This eye-catching piece will be a great addition to any jewelry collection. Beautiful, perfect. <end>  You'll get compliments on this gorgeous necklace!  Finding this necklace was partly due to searching out one that would match a pair of earrings I bought. Somehow it took me a month to find it, but when I did I ordered right away.First off the earrings I had were these onesSterling Silver Small Cushion-Shaped Drop Earrings. Very simple and casual, so finding a necklace to dress them up was important. If you look closely at the necklace you'll see it actually has one of the "cushions" in the center so it was a perfect match.When I received the necklace I was most impressed by the size and weight, it is definitely a quality piece. The double chain was a nice addition and when measured end to end (clasp included) it was 16". Although the 3 squares are free of each other, it lays flat because of that short chain length. I may try it out on a longer chain to see if I can get more movement out of it.In looking through my jewelry I found a second pair of earrings that I can wear with this also.Sterling Silver Open Square Dangle EarringsWhich makes my purchase all that much better. Whether you give this as a gift or keep them for yourself you can't go wrong. <end>  Beautiful Necklace but Chain is Short  I took 1 star away because the chain is not 16 inches. Mine measures 13 inches, the same as my toddler's teddy bear necklace. I love the necklace and my 11 year old niece is getting great use out of the silver double chain it came on. Since the multi-squares are so unique & are absolutely gorgeous, I am still happy with my purchase. I have plenty of 16 & 18 inch silver chains to put it on but I wish the double chain had truly been 16". <end>  Didn't impress me  I bought this item on 50% sale. The so called double-chain was just okay, not unique enough. The pendant is absolutely out of my taste. I knew its gonna be large before I purchased it, due to the description. But still, the effect of a really big and spuare-shaped pendant dangling around creates a rather dull feeling. However, even if it does not fit my taste, it might be fair looking to some other buyers. I give it three stars due to the fact that I am not impressed by it. <end>
 B000JE7CGW  Ruby & Diamond Pearl Pendant in 14K Yellow Gold With 16 inch Chain ||	  looks as good as the picture  The pendant is what attracted me to buy this product and i did. It looks as good if not better than the image but i felt the chain could have been stronger since the actual pendant is more heavier than the chain! So i now have the pendant hanging from another sturdy gold chain that i had and it looks very cute and nice. <end>
 B000JE9LNE  Diamond Seahorse Pendant in White Gold with 16in. chain ||	  Beautiful Seahorse Pendant  I purchased this gift as a graduation gift. It came in a wooden box, carefully packed and there was no need for gift wrapping. Great price and fast delivery. <end>
 B000JEABWO  Diamond (.18 ctw) White Gold Star of David Pendant with 16in. chain ||	  not satisfied  please send me an RMA number so that i can send this product back. The size of the product was extremely small compared to that shown online. I have bought another item similar to this but at macy's. I would like to send this product back as soon as possible. thank you! <end>
 B000JEAC96  Diamond Initial Pendant "D" in 14k Yellow Gold ||	  Perfect gift  The price on this item has gone up since I purchased it but I have to say that it is still cheaper than if you bought it in a store. It was a gift for my young niece so the length of the chain (16") was fine. For an adult, that is a little to short. The quality of the diamonds was fine and the chain strength was also fine. For an adult with a small neck or a young girl, this is a keeper. I had purchased another inital pendant for my other niece at a jewelry store and may I say, it wasn't half as nice as this one for the same amount of money that I paid in the store. I was sorry I didn't see this one before I bought the other one (the store had a no return policy so I was stuck with the other one). I know this is a gift that she can use and enjoy for a lifetime. <end>
 B000JEC7FS  Diamond Initial Pendant "I" in 14k Yellow Gold ||	  "I" of the beholder  Now, you mays be wonderin why a man named "cousinpaco" would strut around wearing the letter "I" around his neck. After all, it's obvious that "cousinpaco" starts with the letter "c."Well, let me tell you, holmes.When people axe me about it, I simply points to my chest and says "'Cause I is the greatest!"The bejeweled capital letter can also double as a Roman numeral, signifying that cousinpaco is Number One. Numero uno. And that's who cousinpaco always looks out for.Some might call my attitude "sef-absorbed," to which I reply  "Then I guess that makes me super-absorbent Bounty, the quicker picker-upper." Since I's also good at pickin' up the ladies, that statement makes double sense. Of course, that would mean I should gets a "B" necklace, but I don't wanna be confusin' peoples.It's all about the bling.Word. <end>
 B000JEW7J4  10k Yellow Gold Rainbow Ring, Size 6 ||	  Versatile ring at a bargain price  I try to avoid 10kt gold, but I got this on clearance for about sixty bucks so it was worth it as a trinket. Turns out to be much more high quality looking than I expected. The stones are all clear and bright. The variety of colors goes with so many outfits. And the size of the ring makes it striking without being horsey (I have smaller hands/shorter fingers so I have to be careful about that). <end>  A sad waste of gold and gemstones  When this ring arrived, I was impressed with it's size, considering that I paid just under $60.00. There was a great deal of gold, and the semi-precious gem stones were of good size. It might have been a pretty cocktail ring. Unfortunately, the picture and the ring were not the same. The picture has stones that look light and well-coordinated. I had no idea what kind of stone my "blue topaz" was because it was a dark, teal green in color. I couldn't tell the difference between the amethyst and the garnet, which were practically identical. Overall, the colors and arrangement of the colors, made the ring look depressing and cheap. Even the gem stone baquettes above the stones gave it a look of poor design, something not evident in the picture. I'll have to send this back -shame on the designer. <end>  Rainbow Ring  You have to like BIG rings to enjoy this ring. It was well worth the money just in its size and you are treated to all your favorite colors in this one. Love it. <end>  looks like a fashion jewelery  I agree with the opinion that this is a waste of gold. It looks like a fake fashion jewelery, and the design is cheap... Well, I only paid $60 for it. <end>  excellent jewelery baargain  This 10K rainbow ring is beautiful and was a lovely gift for my daughter who is thrilled with it. The workmanship, quality stones, and unusual design make it especially attractive. The sale price made it a steal!Dorene Eilenstine <end>  Magnificent  The pictures of this ring does not do it justice. It is absolutely magnificent. Every member of my household thinks that it is beautiful. <end>
 B000JF4XEA  Carnelian pendant necklace, 'Power' ||	  Stunning  I have never seen something so beautifully made, everyone comments on how beautiful it is, its something i have been looking for for along time, something that's me. your artwork is absolutely perfect, shipping was great too, i would highly recommend this great craftsman work..  -) <end>
 B000JF5XTO  Certified Diamond (Round, Ideal cut, 0.62 carats, G color, SI1 clarity) ||	  Everything was EXCELLENT. Exactly what they promised. It appraised for more than what I paid too! It was GORGEOUS!! THANK YOU!  This was the most fun I have ever had diamond/ring shopping!! It was here fast, It was what they promised, the G.I.A. report called my stone an SI1 w/ slight cloud, but YOU CANNOT EVEN SPOT IT!! The stone appraised for almost $800.00 MORE than what I paid for!! THIS WAS FAST, PAINLESS, AND FAIRLY EASY!! No flim flamming jewelry salesman!! No extreme mark up!! <end>
 B000JFHGGM  Flower Diamond Ring 14K White Gold Ladies New Band ||	  Stone fell out! NOT BEZEL  I received this ring as a Christmas gift. It was beautiful until a stone fell out less than 2 months later. We took it to a jeweler and they said that it is NOT a bezel setting as claimed. They said that although the diamonds are great quality the stones are improperly set and all of them could fall out. We are currently trying to get Gem Affair to handle this matter! <end>
 B000JFKEBQ  Sardelli - 14k Gold Polished & Diamond-Cut 9mm Ball Post Earrings ||	  Love these earrings  These earrings are just the right size to be worn every day. The etching in the photo is more prominent than it really is -- the real appearance is more of a texture effect, not glittery they way it looks in the photo. The almost flat backs of these make them very easy to wear and they fit nicely against the ear. I wear them with everything. <end>
 B000JFLV90  14k Gold Polished & Diamond-Cut Swirl 6mm Ball Post Earrings ||	  Beautiful Earrings  The earrings cut swirl finish really makes them sparkle.Service & packaging were great. <end>
 B000JIJTGY  14k White Gold Pink Tourmaline Children's Butterfly Pendant, 15" ||	  not sturdy enough for a toddler  The necklace is TINY and the chain is rather delicate. The chain does not appear long enough to fit comfortably around the neck of a normal sized 8 year old (who might like this design). The chain is not sturdy enough to last with a younger child. The "pink" tourmaline is rather red and dull looking. The stones in the necklace do *not* match the color of stones in the earrings and ring. Overall, this was a waste of money. <end>  It is tiny  The butterfly is kind of tiny. You need to stay really close in order to tell the pendant is a butterfly. But overall the product seems to be of good quality. <end>
 B000JIMZ42  14k White Gold Diamond and Freshwater Cultured Pearl Flower Pendant, 18" ||	  Diamonds are very small. No sparkle  I liked the size of the pendant. The diamonds are so small, no one would even know they were there. No sparkle. <end>  Dazzling Christmas!  I recently bought this pendant for myself for Christmas - the size, color of the pearl, diamonds and chain I was very pleased with - if you want to dazzle someone, wear this pendant with a sexy black dress! <end>  Beautiful Necklace  I love this necklace. I wear it all the time. It was a great bargain. <end>
 B000JJIO96  16 Inch Long 3mm Diameter Black Rubber Cord Necklace w/Sterling Silver Clasp ||	  Nice necklace.  Looks good on a man, nicely priced. Shipping should be lower due to size/weight of package, though. <end>
 B000JJJFT4  14K US Navy Pendant W/Anchor - GH14583 ||	  Impressed!  I am extremely impressed with the CPO pendant I ordered. I actually retired as a Senior Chief but making Chief was the highlight of my Naval career. This Chief's pendant is very detailed and I recommend it to all my Brother and Sister Chief Petty Officers. <end>
 B000JJQC3Q  Moonstone necklace, 'Romantic' ||	  Better than I expected!  I was a little wary purchasing jewelry from the internet, because I had browsed other reviews on similar moonstone necklaces (though they were not from Novica) and saw many complaints about the backing being hollow or the metal being cheap and looking like something one could acquire from a candy machine...This article of jewelry, however, was absolutely fabulous! It came in a timely manner and the creators even sent a short thank-you note on a lovely postcard native to the area in which the jewelry is crafted. One of the best things about this piece is that it looks hand-crafted but is not cheap in appearance. The stone is breathtakingly beautiful... it almost seems to change colors at times when worn against the skin, but you can "control" the color intensity of the stone by wearing it so that it hangs over your clothing - the colors are most vibrant then. I've gotten many compliments on it and the ability to adjust the length whenever I want without worrying about clasps is also an excellent feature (it has a little metal clamp that clutches the leather cord near the ends, which are securely knotted - to adjust it, one simply has to slide the metal clamp forward or backward).All in all, I highly recommend this product. The leather cord allows one to wear this necklace with more casual clothing, but it's certainly adequate for a fancy evening out as well! Once I recover from the payments my new car demands, I'll definitely be browsing through Novica's other products. <end>
 B000JJWWSK  14K White Gold 1/2 ct. Diamond Bridal Engagement Set (G-H Color, SI2-I1 Clarity) ||	  Beautiful at a GREAT Price  The rings arrived early and were in great shape. They are beautiful and it was easy for my fiance too! <end>
 B000JK6X20  16 Inch Long 2.0mm Diameter Brown Leather Cord Necklace w/Sterling Silver Clasp ||	  The cord popped out of the silver end cap in the first 2 days  It was great while it lasted, 2 days. I suppose I could epoxy the cord back in but really it should've been better glued to begin with. It pulled out with only a mild tug as I was going to put it on, not anything out of the ordinary. Oh well. I really would have rated this a 5 had the cord not come off the clasp, as it is a very nice leather necklace, smooth & finished in appearance, not rough at all. <end>
 B000JKRRPW  Pugster 316l Surgical Steel Belly Navel Ring Spring Green Crystal Lizard Dangle Fashion Belly Navel Ring Body Jewelry ||	  love it  Bought for my daughter, she loves it and looks like the picture shown. I would recommend to others to purchase <end>   )  This belly ring is amazing! Great looking quality and it came in a really pretty box! It really is a GREAT gift! I havent taken it out since i got it! <end>
 B000JL7Y86  Amazon.com  C125 Tie Bar - Shiny Silver  Clothing ||	  Great quality  I gave this to my husband as a gift and he loves it. It looks very stylish and is high quality. It is not flashy enough to interfere with his tie or anything and is very functional. I recommend it! <end>  Tie Clasp  Tends to slide on the tie a little. Tie clasp came apart after removing it from tie the first time. Is it worth returning? Will attempt to fix it ourselves. Disappointed. Cheap. <end>  oooohhhh.. shiny  Okay, what can you say about a tie bar. It clips and holds your tie in place. Of course you could say that about a clothes pin to... but this one looks better. <end>
 B000JL8ZA2  Amazon.com  INUYASHA NECKLACE  Clothing ||	  Huge Inu Fan!! ^_^  The Inuyasha Beads of Subjagation that I purchased was well worth the money (and the wait)!!! I absolutely love the necklace and I even wear it more than I do any other piece of jewlery I own (and I have a LOT of jewlery) !! I'm not afraid to wear it in public as I am very proud of the necklace and I am not ashamed to show off my love and affection for my favorite dog demon-INUYASHA!!! ^_^ Every time I wear the necklace I thing of him and my friends love just as much as I do!! I love this necklace and I LOVE INUYASHA!!!!! ^_^ <end>  Beads of Subjectgation XD  I ordered this item only a few days ago and I got it faster then I first expected. Some of the claw shaped beads on the necklace were backwards, but other then that I loved the item. My friend, insane Inuyasha fan, almost scratched my eyes out when she saw me wearing them and my sister kept trying to see what would happen if she said "Sit" when I wore them. I have to say they are bigger then I first thought and very smooth; this is an absolute MUST for any Inuyasha fan/cosplayer. 5 Stars! <end>  I LOVE THIS NECLACE! I LOVE INUYASHA!  I bought this in May and i can tell you one thing  I LOVE THIS NECLACE! i wear it all the time! To school, at home, anywhere! I don't care what other people think. I'm just suporting my favorite half demon! The neclace is just like Inuyasha's in the show, same color, and same size. Its great for cosplaying too! If you are an inuyasha fan you MUST buy this! Its a must buy! <end>  Go Inuyasha!  My family bought this necklace for me on amazon with a set of Inuyasha ears.... it is VERY cool! It is not only large, but it is very smooth.I would have to say, if you buy the ears though, that they are not as fuzzy as Inu's! -_^ <end>  Review on InuYasha Necklace  I just got my InuYasha necklace, and opened the package. It comes in the mailbox in a flate rate mailing envelope. My necklace got here fast! Like way ahead of date it was suppose to be here. WHICH IS AWESOME.The necklace comes in a plastic cover over a printed cardboard with Inuyasha on it. On the back it says  InuYasha VIZ media made in China. The necklace I bought did not have any of the fangs in the wrong place. The purple beads are made out of plastic and so are the fangs, but the size is perfect like the anime and manga.I just now tried it on, and the necklace itself is way too short. The necklace is held together by an elastic, and it stretches and snaps back in place (unlike the anime where is was always one piece but it moved). I am a tall and slim guy about 6'1. The necklace makes my neck look huge because it comes so short. The necklace is above my colarbone. But overall the necklace is awesome!I was so sad to see the show end. I love InuYasha, it has aweseome characters. My personal favorite is Inuyasha. So this necklace is a great way to honor an awesome anime. Any fan should buy it and wear it.For crazy cosplayers that go all out, I would recommend making your own necklace with purple beads and short fangs that are super close to the anime(like the ones used on this necklace), and I would use a solid string thats made out of fabric or leather that is super thin. It would look better for a cosplay. Although this necklace would work fine, but for a tall male like Inuyasha, he would need a longer necklace.Sincerely,Ryan <end>  Inu Yasha Necklace gets me noticed  My brother bought me this necklace about 4 years ago at the Anime Expo and I realy loved it. Not only as a Inu Yasha fan but it just looked cool and it stands out alot. Now I dont have it around my neck like most people I use it as a bracelet around my wrist because I have a yak bone necklace that takes it's place. Like I said i've had it for about 4 years before it broke and I wore it everywhere to the beach, concerts, parties,work, and even played paintball with it on and the worst it got was a little faded. My nieces and nephews loved to play with it they were only a few months old then but they did stretch it out a little but never broke. Untill my oldest brother had his son and he did break it so I had to get a new one, but I really enjoy this necklace and anyone who buys it will not only enjoy it but will definitely stand out more I normaly get asked at least once a day about it or people are just curious and stare. So all in all it is a uniqe item that makes you stand out and very durable as necklaces go. <end>  Sit!!  I love Inuyasha. I actually got these beads when I first bought the Season One boxed set. A little extra but well worth it. I wore these for months around my college campus and got several questions on them as well as amusing my friends with our rendition of Sit (we even started making up a Beads of Subjugation song).The only downside to these is, like with any elastic, it wears out over time. When it happened to mine I simply went to a nearby store's arts and crafts section, got a necklace clasp and a leather cord and remade the necklace (the leather's a bit thick so I had to essentially thread it through the bead openings with monofilament fiber). Still looks the same and I'm once again wearing it.Whether you cosplay or just like the series, this is a good buy. <end>  Inuyasha Fans Should buy this  I love this necklace it looks like the one from the show. I like this a lot. Inuyasha fans should buy this. <end>  Good for fans but a bit underwhelming.  I like the pic of this necklace better than the actual product. The white parts are bigger in real life and the color seems a bit more plastic like than I thought. Color is correct but a bit cheap looking. Functional product and works as designed but could be cheaper. <end>  It was Perfect!  Though I did not waer this necklace, I had bought it for my niece. It seemed perfectly fine and real in its little box. To tell you the truth, it looks just like the very reall necklace of Inuyasha, but it shines becuase it plastic. Over all, everything was OK. <end>  I love it  The neckalace was awsome. I loved it because it's just like Inuyasha's and i just like the bead work thats why im giving it a 5 The price to it is really good too. If you were looking for a neckalace that looks just like inuyasha's in the shows then this is the one you want. ( Not Kidding ) <end>  nice accessory  This is a rather inexpensive accessory from the Inuyasha anime series. For what it is, it's well made. Just remeber that its shiny plastic beads and more for kids. <end>  I loved it alot  Its awesome but really i kinda hate writing a review about this item when i already finished rating about this dam item <end>  Good but it pinches!  It kept on pinching the back of my neck at first and it also gets snagged in my hair. Even though it was amazing when I was inuyasha's fangirl <end>  Inu-Beads  So, I just got this in the mail moments ago, and Im pretty exited about this necklace. its pretty large to theres really no need to stretch so much. The beads are really durable. Ive been a fan of Inu majority of my life and I feel alittle geeky wearing it but hey, Inu fans are rare now in days! None of my fang beads were upside down like majority of the people said. Came very fast, and its really fun to wear. ^_^ Nyuu! <end>  a quicky necklace review  i brought this necklace to go with the sword that i brought. i will get the firerat robes that will tied every thing together. <end>  Love it on the hubby!!! &lt;3  This was the best thing I have ever bought my husband! I absolutely had a lot of fun cosplaying with him. It's not real, it's a heavy plastic. It's to be expected cuz it's a toy!! But it's awesome for every day wear. Eventually, it will break cuz of the string. But that can easily be fixed. I love it on the hubby!! Makes me giggle every time I see him wearing it!! ^^Kagome  Inuyasha!!Inuyasha  KAGOME!!!!THE END. ^^ <end>  Very cute and accurate representation  I bought this on impulse because I had gotten the Kagome necklace a while back. I saw that people are complaining about the beads being on the wrong way, but that was not the problem with mine. I don't even think it's possible to put the tooth shaped beads on the wrong way. They are either wearing the necklace upside down, which is possible, or they are lying. The cord is strechy, but I wouldn't go overboard, proceed with caution when putting it on. I can understand why it's like that too. Inuyasha's necklace isn't meant to be taken off, so it's probably suppose to imitate that. Still, it's worth the buy if you're an Inuyasha fan. <end>  100% WORTHWHILE!  To be completely honest, I absolutely ADORE this necklace! I am still very obsessed with the show even thought the series ended in 2010, and when I saw it I just HAD to have it! After reading the other reviews I was about 95% sure I would get my money's worth if I bought the necklace... and I did!When it arrived on my doorstep exactly one week after I ordered it I tore open the package and saw that it was in terrific condition! It looked exactly like the one on the show! Same color and everything! All the fangs were the right shape and strung the right way, and there was not a scratch on it. It was very smooth and shiny and it seemed to hold together quite nicely! To me it didn't feel like a cheap child's play-thing whatsoever. Although it was not as long as InuYasha's necklace on the show, I still found it quite agreeable because a.) I didn't want it so long that it touched my bellybutton and b.) I'm a small girl so practically EVERYTHING looks bigger on me, even if it is small! Of course it was plastic, which I expected, but it was made of a heavier plastic which put the perfect pressure around my neck (basically enough to allow me to always know that it was there but not so prominent as to make my neck sore). And, as for the whole hair-pulling thing I remember another reviewer mentioning, when it came to my experience the necklace pulled maybe one strand of hair out when I took it off the first day I got it so I could go bed. Other than that it was fine, although I have short shoulder-length hair so maybe that's why it didn't yank my hair out too much! ^_^ Who knows? Overall it was very unique and I am quite proud to own it!So proud, as a matter of fact that I wear it every day whenever I leave the house! Like the many others who also bought this necklace, I really couldn't care less what people think of me when I wear it! I just love the fact that I can have something of my very own that represents InuYasha so well while simultaneously showing others how much I really love InuYasha and anime in general! As an added bonus, I love it so much that I plan on wearing it to college when I graduate this year as well! It is so cool to look at and I bet I will get plenty of compliments on it from all sorts of people! If I ever plan on going to a cosplay convention, if I can't find a friend to dress up like InuYasha while I dress up like Kagome, I'll just wear the necklace myself to that too! Maybe people will think it's a sign that I "belong" to InuYasha or something! XDAnyways the only down side to it that I can see is that like with any necklace with an elastic string, it will probably wear out over time. I don't mean that the beads and fangs themselves will wear out, because they are of good quality, I'm just saying I believe the string holding them together will eventually stretch out and break one of these days. If and when that ever happens to mine though I just plan on gathering the beads and fangs together and re-stringing them on a stronger cord made of leather. I've heard those last for years so I think that would be best, considering I want this necklace to be around for a good while! For now, though, the necklace is holding up well even though I stretch it up over my head every day.All in all the shipping was fast, the service was great and the product itself was worthwhile! I would recommend it to any and all InuYasha fans as well as those just looking for a unique necklace to catch your friends' and family's eyes. I am very pleased that I took the chance and bought this necklace and like I said I believe anyone who buys this will feel the same way!Oh and before I forget, some other reviewers also said that some of their fangs were backward when the necklace arrived, and out of anger they complained that the picture hadn't shown that when they bought it on Amazon.com. Although I would have been angry and disappointed if that had happened to me, I actually don't feel too badly for them because I took a closer look at the first picture and it actually does show (in my opinion) that two out of the eight fangs are backward. If you look closely at the fangs, you can clearly see that the top two fangs are a shade or two darker than the fangs on the bottom, which would only happen if they were backwards because the only way they would be darker is if there was a shadow over them, which happens when the fangs are turned backward. Since the top of the fang curls over the bottom, that would cause a shadow, which causes the darker shade that wouldn't happen if the fangs were the right way. This is proved when you look at the rest of the fangs which are all the same color and are actually lighter than the top two. I don't know if it's just me, but the necklace in the picture did look like the top two fangs were backward, and I knew going in that the necklace might be like that when I got it. Luckily though like I said before the fangs were all the right way when I got my necklace... but even if they hadn't been I would have loved the necklace anyway! It's just so fantastic and a must have if ever in your life you loved the show InuYasha!  D <end>  A little too short.  This is a very cute replica of InuYasha's fang necklace. However it runs a little shorter than his does. Meaning that on my 8 year old it doesn't fit how it should fit on InuYasha. Or maybe I'm just picky? Who knows. On an adult this likely wouldn't work very well with an InuYasha costume. Though I could be wrong on that. I am surprised it has held up these past four months that we've had it, because lets face it, 8 year old's can be rough!Still, it looks nice and goes well enough with the costume that she hasn't complained. It's just me that is picky. <end>  Cosplay  It's a useful accessory for cosplaying Inuyasha. I personally thought it would be the size of the necklace that you see on the show, but there isn't as much slack as you may think. It's not tight or anything, just surprisingly smaller. It's still a good product however, and it does its job. It can also be worn whenever you feel like it. It's not an eyesore at all. <end>  Sit boy.  The necklace came very quickly and was in excellent condition. Worked great with my Halloween costume even tho I was not Inuyasha. Great conversation starter, people kept asking where it was from. It made an already awesome night even better. Love it. <end>  Just like the picture!  I got this for my fiance who is an avid Inuyasha fan like myself. It took only 3 days to get the necklace from ordering! It looks exactly like Inuyasha's beads of subjugation. It has an elastic band so it'll fit anyone. Yes, the beads are plastic, but it's a heavy plastic so it doesn't feel like a children's toy (although it's completely kid friendly too). I would recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the show  ) <end>  plastic?  I really like this, only thing is I didn't relize it was made of plastic. Other than that, cool~! I use it as a bracelet <end>  Necklace  I'm a really big inuyasha fan, so when I saw this I just had to have it. The necklace looks just like the one inuyasha wears, the only thing I don't like is that it pulls hair. I have very long hair and it's always pulling strands out. Other than that annoyance I love this necklace! <end>  Good product  Its perfectly accurate, and corresponds to the anime perfectly, but its strung together very cheaply. <end>  needs fixing  What really gets me is when you get it and two of the teeth are backwards!!! In the picture it doesn't show that! I have also seen alot of reviews saying this too!! Other than that it's a great necklace for any Inuyasha fan! <end>  Gift for an Inuyasha fan.  I bought this for my best friend because she is a huge Inuyasha fan. Every friday she comes home with me from school and she stays friday night and saturday night for a weekly sleepover. It was a Friday when my dad tossed the package into the backseat of the car. I opened it and gave it to her. She was so happy with it. It looks like the real necklace that Inuyasha wears and about as big.She wears it very little but it's displayed in her room. ^^ <end>  does not make sense  ok shipping was fast but what the heck... most of the fangs are on the opposite side of the necklace. its retarted now i have 2 find a good chain necklace and put it 2gether myself w/ the fangs correctly facing the RIGHT WAY ... cuz some1 didnt assemble it correctly .. <end>  Inu-licious =D  Me  Well, well what do we have here? Ah! yes inu-kun's necklace.. HA! I love this necklace [holds necklace to her chest] mine!! [hiss,hiss]InuYasha  What are you doing?Me  [blinks] Worshiping your smexy-ness  3 meow..InuYasha  [sweatdrop] No .. why do you have my necklace?-AND WILL YOU STOP THAT?!Me  [is poking him] I Have your necklace because I bought it, and No. [continues poking him]InuYasha  [left eye twiches] You .. bought .. MY NECKLACE?! [pushes my hand away]Me  Yes. [licks his cheek] Rawr..InuYasha  But I- [looks at his necklace now back on his neck] okay.. why did you give it back?Me  [ahem] Sit boy!InuYasha  [fall flat onto his face twiching] Kuso..Me  Meow  3 <end>

 B000JR40XC  Remote Control Holder - "Naked" Ebony RCH-36N ||	  Great way to organize remote controllers  These are a great way to keep your multiple remotes organized and your tabletop clutter free. I bought 2 of the black. <end>  Nice looking, but could be better.  The two middle slots are narrower than the two outside slots which I don't care for. Remotes can be bulky. And though mine all fit in the slots, I have to put the bigger controls on the outside ones. It would have been nicer to make all the slots equal in size and a little larger. <end>

 B000JRC9YO  Sterling Silver Cross Patonce Men's Ring Flawless Finish, 5/8 inch wide, sizes 9 to 14 ||	  Outstanding In Every Way  I purchased the sterling silver cross Patonce ring. It's handsome and heavy, as a man's ring should be, and the delivery was prompt. Size was exact. The price was an outstanding bargain. I recommend Sabrina Silver with no qualifications whatsoever. <end>  This Ring is of Outstanding Quality and Just What I Wanted  I had been looking for a cross ring and decided upon this one. It looks great, a perfect fir and the finish is flawless. It also polishes up very well. <end>  OK Ring  It's just not the quality that I was wanting, it doesn't feel like a high quality ring. <end>  Beautiful ring!  I bought this ring as a gift for my husband, who is pretty particular, and he loves it. Very good quality; appears as in picture. <end>

I got this for my husband and it was better then the picture if you love celtic stuff you will love this ring! <end>  size not expected  The ring felt a little thinner than expected, but aside from that it's a nice looking ring. The problem is that it fit much smaller than the size listed. I am able to wear it but not on the finger I wanted because it's too small. <end>
 B000JREALY  Sterling Silver Iron Cross Men's Ring Flawless Finish, , sizes 9 to 14 ||	  Sophisticated yet Masculine  I was impressed by this ring. Overall finish was nice, however with up close inspection some faint abrasions are visible. But, I'm sure with a good polish they would be removed. The Cross is strong and solid looking yet, not over bearing. I searched for a long time to find a nice Iron Cross Ring, this one is definitely the most stream lined and stylish ring out there. A little pricey but, worth it for a unique ring. <end>  Brilliant  This ring is awesome i got it for myself its big & more for a guy but i wear it & love it.I ordered 2 other rings for my son & husband they were cheaper rings & not from this company Well you get what you pay for those rings were more for a womans hand.They were not happy.This is a heavey ring its not for a small hand. <end>  Great Quality!  This ring has such a high quality and the finish is flawless! I accidentally ordered the wrong size for the finger that I wanted it to fit. Luckily i fits on my pinkiefinger, cause it would be a shame not to be able to use this beautiful ring.I can strongly recommend it! <end>  Very Very pleased with this ring  I purchased this ring for my husband. I was a little scared because the only iron cross rings I found in the store looked really cheaply made. But this was a good price so I gave it a shot. I was very please when it arrived. It is a solid ring and very polished. No nicks or scratches. It is very thick and sturdy which is great for him. He loves it and I am very happy. <end>

 B000JTHWU8  Beach Delight Long Shell Dangle Earrings ||	  cute earrings  These earrings were really cute, however they break easily. Must keep them in a safe place where they cannot get broken. <end>  earrings dangled right off the hoop  AS soon as I rec'd the earrings, I noticed in the little transparent plastic bag that the one shell was not attached to anything. But as soon as I notifed the company, they immediately said they would refund my money, which they did. Even tho the product was packaged very well to ship, I imagine that that is where the shell became unattached. As they say, "accidents happen" and because the company was so accomodating, I would definately use them again. So "1 star" for the earrings, but "10 stars" to the company. <end>
 B000JTHXBQ  Antique Bronze Metallic Multistrand Chain Dangle Earrings ||	  bronze dangle earrings  these earrings are perfect to wear with casual and dressy clothes. they can be worn with almost anything. i received several compliments while wearing them. <end>  Lovely  These earrings are lovely but are a very different from the picture. First of all on the picture they appear to be light brown color but the ones i got are gray almost black. This makes them look really really cheap almost like made by a kid. They sparkle a bit in the light and look sleek, long, so they are not really for casual wear.So i am a bit disappointed but they made a great gift, so 4 stars. <end>  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!  I PURCHASED NECKLACE & EARRINGS. NOT VERY BIG, BUT JUST PERFECT! THEY ARE LONG, WHICH I LOVE! AND THE NECKLASE CAN BE LONGER OR SHORTER! JUST LOVE THE SHINE TO THE BEADS!!! JUST PERFECT! <end>

 B000JUDPM6  Star of David with Heart and Dove Necklace from the Artazia Collection #685 JN ||	  Amazing  This necklace is fantastic! I have worn Star of David necklaces all my life, but I have never had one this beautiful! I love that it has the heart inside with the dove. I am 20 years old and active, but this is great size, it is not heavy, and it doesn't get in my way. I sleep with it also. I never take it off unless I am in the water. I definitely recommend this necklace for ANYBODY. The chain is beautiful also. <end>  unique  Although the product arrived one day late from the day expected, I truly love the uniquenessof this lovely Star of David. I choose it since it incorporates three of my favorite icons. I alwaysreceive positive compliments whenever I wear it. <end>

 B000JUHY3C  Blue Dog Earrings from the Artazia Collection #334BL NE ||	  Unique Earrings  This is a wonderful gift for someone who has or has had a dog named "Blue." I've received many compliments every time I've worn the earrings, especially from dog lovers and fans of Mr. Bojangles.If Amazon permitted star reviews, I would have given this 3 stars instead of 4 but even so, I don't feel uncomfortable giving it 4 stars. The reason it lost a star was because to me, the Swarovski crystals feel too large and bright and as a result seem to overpower the dogs. I wish the crystals were smaller or that the dogs were larger so that the crystals would be a highlight instead of the focus. It's hard to see this in the picture on Amazon because the earrings look as though they were taken in the best possible light or lack there of, as the case may be(!). Also, I felt like the earrings were a little overpriced by about $10 (current price is ~$60).I'd also like to make a comment about the seller, Artazia. This was not factored into my rating of the earrings but because it could impact the way buyers view reviews of Artazia's items, I think it's important to mention.On October 18, 2011, I received an e-mail from the seller and was saddened to read the following "As a small token, for every 4-5 Stars rating you leave us within the next 3 days, we will e-mail you a $10 coupon code good for any purchase from The Artazia Collection. You will receive the code within two business days after your feedback is approved and published by Amazon."Better yet, if at the same time you also add a short, 4-5 star review of the item you purchased from Artazia (this can be done on the item page on Amazon) we will double the coupon amount to $20."I purposely waited until the fifth day to post a comment so no one would wonder if my rating was genuine. I wouldn't have minded if Artazia offered a discount for feedback without stipulating a rating but this feels unethical to me. I realize that Amazon changes the placement of items in search results based on ratings but shouldn't an item's rating stand on the item's merit instead of being bought? I like Artazia's unique, funky jewelry and I had planned to purchase the matching pin but now no longer feel comfortable doing so. Should their policy change, I'll reconsider this stance.Whether or not this feedback serves as a factor for potential buyers when purchasing from Artazia, I hope they'll at least keep this policy in mind while reading reviews of Artazia's items. $20 off is almost half price of some of their items, which could serve as an incentive to give a high rating. I especially hope Artazia will reconsider their current policy on procuring feedback and have more faith in the quality of their own artwork. <end>

 B000JUI7C4  Hummingbird Horn Earring Hanger 6 gauge ||	  Dissappointment.  I love these guages, so much. I expected to get both gauges as in a PAIR seeing as usually you'd pay anywhere from $14.00-$20.00 for gauges that come in pairs. That was why I decided to pay $24.00 (without shipping) for a nice SET of gauges but when this one arrived, I was dissappointed in myself for not actually reading what the description of this product was but more dissappointed in Pierce This 2 for putting up a picture of the gauges AS A SET making it seem like someone ordering could get both gauges. (For someone to order just one is weird because no one gauges just one ear.) My advice? Pierce This 2, please either change the picture or sell them both for the price you'd like because I made a mistake, yes, but yours is very unreasonable. Thankssss ( <end>  Not worth it  You can get a PAIR of gauged earrings for the exact same price these people are charging for A SINGLE earring. Even at expensive places with just as cool designs as this- like hot topic and other places online. Just not worth it when you realize they are 25 dollars a piece. <end>  Pricy But Good Quality  I really enjoyed wearing these gauges. Yes they are pricey, yes they do not come as a pair. My biggest problem with them was that they would occasionally slip out of my ear and for the price you could imagine how many near panic attacks I had when I realized something was missing! Would not recommend wearing these while sleeping or showering or at the pool since they do have a tendency to fall out since they are so smooth. Overall you might be better off buying a gauge that is less likely to fall out. <end>
 B000JVR60W  Nvie's Supreme Wood Pendant Necklace with Resin and Glass Beads ||	  Really like this necklace, even if I didn't read the description.  I relied on the picture and the price and assumed this was going to be a small necklace. It's not. When it arrived, I was somewhat thrown at the necklace's size. The pendant is a bigger circumference than the bottom of a "venti" sized iced drink from the well known coffee chain.  )I have never worn jewelry this large as I am not a large person. However, this necklace is very pretty. I wore it to work today and it quickly "grew on me". It went really well with the lime green/cream/dark brown ensemble I wore. I'm about to order a bunch more NVIE necklaces.  ) <end>  Nice, but big  Good quality for the price, but the wooden pendant is almost the size of the palm of my hand. I had expected it to be a little smaller. It's still a nice necklace, though. <end>  COLORFUL NECKLACE  Cute necklace to wear with summer clothes. Colors very attractive plus is a nice length. Am sure glad I bought this. My husband liked it <end>
 B000JVTIO4  Pearly Strand Collar Necklace with Amber Glass Beads ||	  Colorful Fun  I really like this piece. I did not have the same experience as it looks like some have had -- there is absolutely no odor at all. This is not an expensive-looking necklace, it's just beads, but I like the splash of color it supplies. I can wear it to work and feel fine about it. I think it's fun and different. <end>  terrible product  Very cheap looking, smells bad. Also, it is almost impossible to contact customer service for return or refund. <end>
 B000JVTIQM  Blue and Green Multicolor Glass Pendant Necklace ||	  Cute but, you get what you pay for  This is a very affordable necklace and it is also cute. The actual pendant dangling from the center of the necklace is a little bit different than as pictured at least for mine. It is not as round or as shiny and mine was more of a flat oval shape with a pretty periwinkle/whitish stone with some green. Although in the center is a small scratch and the scratch is filled with this brownish substance. It's not really that big of a deal but it bothers me a little when I look at it in the mirror.I suppose it's only to be expected when it is so inexpensive. I still really like the necklace and will wear it whenever since I figure it was only a small defect with mine. <end>  FASHONABLE & AFFORDABLE  I happened to be looking for an inexpensive piece to wear to the beach & this definately fit the bill. It was affordable & I'm sure I will wear this one for many more summers to come. <end>  Equisite Necklace  Blue and Green Multicolor Glass Pendant Necklace. This necklace is beautiful and exquisitely crafted. This necklace is a one of a kind of piece of jewelry that most women would love. In addition, I believe it is good thing that some of the profits from the sell of this necklace will go to helping others. <end>  Cute for summer  This is a cute necklace for under $3. There is a lot of beading and detail for the price. It may not last forever (doubt it) but for this price, I will enjoy it for as long as I can. <end>
 B000JVTM68  Blue Floral Beaded Collar Necklace ||	  Cute...but...the clasp is horrible.  When I received this neckace, I honestly thought there was no clasp. I studied the necklace and thought, "Umm, it doesn't stretch, how am I supposed to get it around my neck?" Then I realized the clasp is just a short, curved over piece of wire. The wearer is supposed to hook it through one of the holes of the chain. Which would be fine if one had the vision and manual dexterity of a Super-Human. I had to get my husband to hook it, and he had trouble.It is pretty though. I recommend wearing it with a scoop neck or V Neck blouse or dress. It really can't adjust to the right length to be worn with a collared shirt. <end>
 B000JVXO8K  Turquoise Blue Beaded Long Collar Necklace ||	  OK, but not great  The color is very pretty, the seed beads are fine, but the larger beads look a bit cheap. Wearing this necklace with another one may improve the overall look. For the price, it at least adds a bit of color to an everyday, running around sort of outfit. <end>
 B000JVXRMS  Earth Tone Resin Beaded Long Collar Necklace with 12 sided beads ||	  Worth the 5 dollars I paid, but not more than that.  I got this necklace because I needed something cheap to brighten up some of my office clothes but didn't want to spend a fortune in real jewelry.This necklace is not very nice at the touch. In fact, I should say it's very plastic-y and feels like junk. You do get what you pay for, and at five dollars, this was what was expecting to get, more or less.However, if you do not hold it in your hands, it looks nice and I have received quite a few compliments for it, which I was very surprised about. It serves its purpose to brighten up black turtlenecks and brown jumpers, so I am relatively happy with it.I can't honestly give it more than three stars, because it is not a fabulous piece but the price is fair and if you ignore how it feels when you hold it, but just focus on how it looks when you wear it, it is an accessory I'd recommend and would probably buy again. <end>
 B000JVY5HE  Konark Antique Pendant Necklace with Brass Bead Strand ||	  Great necklace  This beaded necklace was exactly what I was looking for for a casual summer look to my work wardrobe. It looks great with anything! I couldn't have asked for anything better for the price <end>  pendent is very large  the pendent is very large (around 2 inches long). I think I may take it off because when the necklace is so short, it seams a little too high for such a big pendent. <end>  Lovely necklace BUT cheep pendant & necklace might be small for someone else!  Pros -------- The necklace itself is so cute, the kind of necklace that u wear all the time.- The necklace itself is good quality.- Very nice earthy colors that goes with just about anything.Cons ------- Pendant looks too cheep! I didn't think twice before removing it just after I got the necklace. (I needed a tool to do that but it was easy.)- The necklace is small but it works for me as I have small to normal size neck. However, I think it might be small for someone else with slightly bigger neck because it just fits mine!I do recommend it to you if your neck is not big and if you gonna remove the Pendant! <end>  Disappointing  I thought this piece looked beautiful and interesting in the picture, but it turned out to be nothing but disappointing. I know it was inexpensive so maybe I should have expected it, but this necklace looks VERY cheap. It resembles some cheap knock-off of a medallion you would find in an adventure movie. <end>  Gorgeous necklace  I have received many compliments when I have worn this necklace with a plain white tee shirt or a dressier black mock turtle neck. It is well made and a work of art. <end>  odd smell  This is a good looking necklace. However, when I hold it at hand, it smells like copper and some paint. I don't like the smell and I have a feeling the paint is not safe for skin. <end>
 B000JVZU2S  Kristina's Choice Emerald Color Beaded Collar Necklace ||	  Basically as depicted  When I received this necklace, I thought it was more or less as the picture showed. My only complaint is that the beads are both clunkier and quite a bit darker than I thought they would be (namely the green), so it is less summery. The design is basically the same, I just wasn't particularly impressed with the colors. Gave it a 4/5 instead of 3/5 because I figure it's just not quite my taste. <end>  cute bargin  We got this for may daughter to give as a gift - very cute!As stated in other reviews  the colors were a bit darker than the photo, but that was fine with us. <end>  Love It!  As others have said the colors are MUCH darker. More of an emerald green with copper accents. Quite stunning, I think. I'm quite pleased and will be buying more of these. <end>  Not what I was expecting  This necklace is a pretty necklace, but it is definitaly a lot darker than what this picture shows. I don't like it quite as much. It's definitely more fall like than spring like. Oh well, maybe I should put a picture up of what it really looks like so people know  ) <end>
 B000JWHR3W  Translucent Earthy Green Resin Bangle Bracelet ||	  not pleased  this bracelet came broken and i didn't have enough time to buy another one, it was packed very poorly, if it wasn't broken it would have been very pretty, it is quite a bit darker than the picture shows <end>  Great fun accessory  This bangle is great for casual wear to dress up an outfit for spring or summer. Colour is true to screen display. Note if you have big hands, it may be an effort to get it on (if at all)! <end>
 B000JWHR5A  Starry Etch Wood Bangle Bracelet ||	  Wife loved it  All I need to say is that the wife loved it and wears it regularly. <end>
 B000JWIEL6  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Wings Clear Crystal Quartz Sphere Slide Pendant ||	  Great Pendant  I liked the wing type look of this pendant, as it's different from other celtic pendants I've seen over the years. I wear it from time to time and almost always have someone remark that it's pretty or unusual or ask me what it's supposed to be. The workmanship, and quality of crystal and sterling are worth the money. <end>  Beautifully made pendant!  This pendant is beautifully made, and definately not a light weight. The silver is sturdy, and even more beautiful when seen in person then the picture describes. Although it states it is "Celtic Angel Wings" everyone that sees it wants to know where I got the great BattleAxe, which I guess it does more closely resemble. Either way, it's the one I wear just about all the time! <end>
 B000JWJ1FO  20" Egyptian 18K Gold Pendant Chain ||	  Beautiful Necklace  This is a beautiful necklace! Egyptian Imports truly has quality items at affordable prices. <end>
 B000JWMKBG  Red Dyed Mother of Pearl and Sea Shell Bracelet ||	  I was surprised but in a GOOD way!  I love this bracelet. I bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas. The bracelet has some weight to it but other than that, it's perfect. I love the color and texture of the beads. I highly recommend this item. <end>  Pretty  This bracelet looks really great on my girlfriend, cheap too. If you and your girl are having hard times, pop out with one of these and she'll forget why she was mad at you  ) <end>
 B000JWMKFC  Red Crystal and Cherry Quartz Bracelet ||	  Red? No.  First of all, this bracelet is pink. I don't know if maybe they sent me the wrong one, or if this used to be a different color, but the bracelet I received was unmistakably pink. If pink is okay with you, this bracelet is about 7 inches (18 cm) and stretchy. The pink jagged looking rock pieces are not aggravating in the least, it is quite comfortable. The stretchy threads holding it together are a red color. The round beads are very smooth and look almost like shattered glass on the inside, which looks very cool. This bracelet is actually pretty good, but they need to stop advertising it as red because it is pink. <end>
 B000JWNKH4  24" Egyptian 18K Gold Pendant Chain ||	  Beautiful Necklace  This is a beautiful necklace! Egyptian Imports truly has quality items at affordable prices. <end>
 B000JWTXPC  Loving Family&reg Vermeil Pendant - Parents and 4 Children ||	  Lovely quality, a little large  This necklace is of excellent quality, very solid pendant, very nice delicate chain that doesn't catch on anything. The gold color is very nice, not cheap looking at all.This is a very large pendant, which is good for some, not-so-good maybe for others. The chain is also very long, so you have to plan for that. You also have to plan for the fact that this pendant is definitely three dimensional - not flat at all, not hollowed out at the back like many pendants. It has the round oval shape of a polished stone, so it commands some attention. Not a pendant for the faint of heart.I give this a four because it is lovely and of very good quality, but the picture makes it look a little smaller than it really is. Be sure to read the measurements carefully, and enjoy. <end>
 B000JYXDXI  Crosley Deluxe Sleigh Music Box BK325 ||	  No longer worked after 3 months  Nice looking Christmas decoration, but it failed to work by the time we put it away. We probably only played it less than 5 times. <end>
 B000JZ29I2  SilverBin Enamel Paint Rock n Roll Guitar Stainless Steel Italian Charm Link ||	  Dissapointed  The charm was very cute, just as it appears in the picture... until it fell off a week after I got it. <end>

 B000JZ8J3Q  Southwestern Style Three Dimensional Lizard Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 10, #10992 ||	  Love it!  Very beautiful. I bought it for my boyfriend and he wears it every day. Wonderful quality. <end>
 B000K1QUQW  Wooden Stretch Bracelet ||	  Very Cute!  I think these are just adorable. Very cute to just slip on and go. I used mine a few months back as a nursing reminder bracelet with my newborn. Worked great! <end>
 B000K23C8U  10kt. White Gold, 1/4 ct.tw. Diamond Circle Journey Pendant ||	  love,love, love it!  Our mother is celebrating a significant birthday and we wanted to get her something special to remember it by. The necklace is beautiful, sparkly, elegant, just gorgeous! definitely worth the 279.! of course we knew it would be nice bc it had the Littman name attached to it ) <end>
 B000K275I8  1/5 ct. tw. Diamond Journey 7 Stone Pendant in 10K White Gold ||	  Delicate  It is so delicate & that's what I like. I have had so many comments on it. <end>
 B000K2BTSK  18k Gold Round-Cut Diamond 4-Prong Studs (1/3 cttw, H-I Color, SI1-SI2 Clarity) ||	  Beautiful gift, don't hesitate.  I bought these as a present for my lovely wife. At first I thought they were very small due to a couple other reviews but I was very surprised when my wife opened the box. The size is perfect, they were not tiny or small, I consider these are mid-size (it's my personal opinion) and the quality is way beyond I imagine and of course the most important thing is that she loves them!. Thank you amazon. <end>  You Won't Regret It...  Recommendation  Buy these.To lend weight to my recommendation, this is only the 2nd Review I've written on Amazon. These earrings are beautiful; there are no flaws I can determine with the naked eye. They're packaged in a great dark wood box - very elegant! The size is perfect; anything larger, in my opinion, would be overdoing it - but this is the wearer's preference of course! If you're looking for earrings in this size-range, consider these. You won't regret it! <end>  Change  I hope I can change the product with another one from you before being shipped. <end>  REALLY TINY -- LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FOR CHILDREN  I ordered these for my wife for last Valentine's Day. I was VERY disappointed. Very tiny, cheap looking. Looked like they were for a small child. I gave a 2-star rating, but I felt that was too high. <end>  very nice earrings  first time buying earrings on line. the reviews are very accurate and helped in my decision to purchase. got them when they were on sale for $300.00. <end>  Nice diamonds  1/3 carat is a good size. I like how the white gold is almost invisible and you just see the diamonds. <end>  trusted to 5 star reviews of this product, got it and didn't regret at all  I've been looking thru all these reviews prior to buying this item. People poorly rated these earrings must be a millionaires got used to 2 carat size diamonds surrounded by tons of gold. On the other hand they might have been those who never have had a diamond jewelery before they got these earings, who apparently expected to get a huge rocks after paying 500$. These are diamonds for middle class. The modest and stylish acessory which I woul describe as the best for that money. <end>  White Gold diamond studs  This set of diamond studs are of the color and clarity as advertised. They arrived with excellent packing and in excellent condition. My wife loves them. <end>  Yep, better than expected.  As other reviews have said, and I will also 1) great looking quality - I mean, really, what do I know, I'm no jeweler, but they are very clear, no color at all (i.e. yellow/brown), and sparkle brilliantly with lovely colors in the light.2) The mounting is really nice. Almost disappears so you just see the gem(white gold)3) The size is really OK -- my wife has very small ears, so they look "normal" not small -- but honestly, even before she put them on, when they first arrived I was a bit surprised they looked - not big - but not small.Very good deal at $305 - Amazon came through here! <end>  Excellent quality and price  Ordered these on the 23rd and chose one day shipping. They arrived on Christmas Eve as promised. As a last minute gift for my wife, I didn't have too much time to do research except for a trip to the local department store. The department store variety was overpriced and of horrendous quality for the money. These, on the other hand, exceeded expectations and are every bit what they are stated to be. The sparkle and clarity was even better than her 1ct. earrings she presently wears. These were purchased to go in the second hole above those, and these look much whiter and brighter.Overall, Amazon's service and representation is spot on. My wife is so pleased, and I don't have to sleep on the couch. A win win!If you are in doubt about ordering these earrings just check all the reviews. You can't go wrong buying this pair and will be more than pleasantly surprised when they arrive. <end>  A wonderful gift  I haved looked these over pretty good and compared them to another set that were 1/4 tcw with 14k gold for about the same price. Me and my daughters looked at the color and clarity and refraction of the light off the facets of these 1/3 tcw earings. They are better quality in our opinions. They really seam to sparkle.I used cool white light from a C-4 led source and used blue green and red filters with this light source. The 1/3 tcw earring seemed a little more cloudy with this light source and the facets did not seem to be as noticeable.We think Mom is going to be very very happy this Christmas! <end>  crap quality compared to Blue Nile.  Purchased this for a gift. Quality is trash compared to earrings that I had previously purchased from Blue Nile with similar color/clarity. Looks like dirty pieces of glass versus shiny diamonds (Blue Nile). You can see flaws with the naked eye, under no magnification. Extremely disappointed; however, item was purchased for a gift and too late to return by the time I received it. Reluctantly gave it as a gift anyways.  ( <end>  delighted  I have found the size of the earrings perfect, not being a large person they fit my face wonderfully. The colour and clarity were what we expected and much more. As my children tell me you can see them sparkle from across the room. I would not hesitate in purchasing diamonds online again. <end>  Beautiful earings  Before buying these earrings on Amazon, I did price comparisons of the same diamond stud earrings from different sellers, both local and online, and Amazon beat them all with very affordable price (it was a Gold Box Deal of the Day for $297). Immediately fall in love with them when received. They sparkle perfectly. Right size for my ears. Love them!! <end>  One of the better Diamond deals at Amazon  I got these for ~280$ at Amazon during a Mother's day deal. Which was a good deal considering the SI1-SI2 clarity. I say that because for the last few months (2009), you can buy 1/2 carat studs with I1-I3 clarity for 250$ at Kays Jewelers (and you can pick and choose from several pieces).But when I got the Amazon studs, I was very pleasantly surprised with their clarity and sparkle. I was not particular about the size being small, because I needed something smaller for every-day wear(the amazon 'on the ear' image is pretty accurate). When I went and compared them with the I1-I3 pieces I saw at the Jewelers, there was a VERY significant difference in the clarity and sparkle but not a lot in size. Even the rep there was surprised I got them for under 300$So if you are more concerned about the size of the diamond, you might want to check out the local jewelers first and rummage through the 8-10 pairs they usually carry - and pick the one which is clearest i.e. less yellow to the eye.Otherwise 1/3 carat SI1-SI2 under 300$ was a very good deal for me. Too bad their prices have climbed since then.PS  As some of you might know, Coscto also has great deals on diamonds, but they seldom carry smaller pieces like these studs. <end>  Exactly what I wanted!  )  I was a little nervous buying diamonds online, but these were an excellent price and are exactly as described by Amazon.com. It's a good idea to understand diamond sizes because these can appear a bit small initially, but after putting them on, they are exactly what I was looking for in a diamond stud (I wanted these for the second hole, not so much for the primary). Nevertheless, I've been wearing these as in the primary hole on their own, and they convey a modest glamour. The clarity and cut is beautiful, and they are extremely sparkly in normal light. I ordered white gold, and the prongs are hardly visible. The backs feel very secure (actually they're almost difficult to take off), and I could not be happier with these earrings. Mine arrived in a velvet box within a navy box with the earring specification on the underside (so sounds like the packaging has been upgraded since some of the other reviews). I'd give these even more stars if I could. If you're lookng for a modest but beautiful diamond, these fit the bill perfectly.Update (May 31, 2011)  I still love these things...my single most treasured piece of jewelry. I think I've had them out of my ears a handful of times in the last two years. They go with everything, they are beautiful, and I couldn't be happier with them!!! <end>  Never buying diamonds offline again!  This is the second pair of diamond studs I buy online, and I am supremely satisfied. The quality is exactly as described (although I wish there was a certificate attached about the specifications).The only improvement I would recommend is a more premium type of packaging, rather than the small velvet pouch. <end>  Excellent!  Bought these for a birthday present and shopped several websites. Amazon gave the most for the money spent. Earrings come in a very nice earring box and are beautiful! Amazed at the fire these have! Very, very happy with this purchase. <end>  Perfect Earrings!!  Perfect!! I've been searching for a pair of diamond earrings in 18kt gold for my second hole with a high quality color and cut and these earrings have over exceeded my expectations. These are everything they claimed to be and more. And the price was just an added bonus. A must buy!! <end>  perfect  I purchased these earrings for myself. They are a perfect size with beautiful color and sparkle. Amazon's price was less than half the cost of my local jeweler. <end>  My wife loved them!  I gave these to my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary and she loved them. They are high quality but not ostentatious. <end>  1/3 cttw  very nice looking diomond , bright and shine , but very very small , make sure you know exactly what a 1\3 looks like before buying. hope it helps with ur desicion <end>  More about Amazon than jewelry  This is more about Amazon than the earings. My wife loves them, and I think she looks great in them, so we're very happy. She has a box full of jewelry that I bought her that she never wears, that's where Amazon comes in. First I bought a diamond bracelet, but Duh, she can't really wear it all the time. Amazon took it back and issued a refund three days later. Then we researched clarity, color online and customer reviews.I'm a grumpy old man, and I don't tolerate poor customer service. I've fired a lot of online services but I alway come back to Amazon. I think you have to be cautious with outside vendors offered through Amazon, but you can alway check the ratings, and even better you can call (I did that with an unbelievable $100 wool suit). Hence the rare 5 stars. <end>  nice size, they look great  these are a very nice size... I thought they would be smaller but I was surprised... they look really nice on... no complaints, good price at $300 <end>
 B000K2DSXE  Sterling Silver and 14k Yellow Gold Amethyst Ring, Size 5 ||	  Silver and gold setting amethyst ring is lovely  Lovely, dainty, the gold bars frame the purple of the amethyst, while the swirley ring in silver is lovely with the total design of the ring. Ring looks just like the picture, and I chose it because it was affordable and I like to wear silver and gold together. It looks more expensive than it is, and it is worth the price. It also comes in peridot or citrine, if you prefer these stones. <end>  I love these rings  I bought this ring with a peridot and loved it so much I bought the amethyst later. Now I see they're marked down and am tempted to buy the other two colors as well. I get compliments on these rings all the time. They really are very pretty. <end>  Dark Stone  I purchased this ring for my mother for her birthday, and I also purchased one in peridot for myself. The stone was so dark that mom thought it was a dark blue sapphire,sadly, I had to tell her it was actually an amethyst. The setting is beautiful and I really enjoy my peridot version, and my mom really likes her dark purple amethyst version. I would recommend this purchase. <end>  disappointed  I read the other ratings and went for it, and sent it right back. The stone was so dark it didn't even look like an Amethyst and I felt the band was kind of cheap looking when it arrived. <end>
 B000K2F436  18k Gold, Princess-Cut, Diamond 4-Prong Studs (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, SI1-SI2 Clarity) ||	  White Hot Gorgeous  These diamonds are crystal clear. The white gold adds to their brilliance. Their size is substantial enough to be noticed and yet believeable. The backs are strong and secure. I never have to worry about losing them even if I forget to take them off before going to sleep. I wear them with every type of jewelry... white or yellow gold or sterling silver or by themselves. They are easily the most worn pair of earrings in my extensive wardrobe. <end>  Wife loves them  Got the yellow gold set as an anniversary gift for my wife. She loved them, so really not much more I can ask for. The stones are clear and reflect a lot of light; these really sparkle. Although they look relatively small in their box, they don't look undersized at all when they're being worn. There are larger studs at similar price points, but with lower grade colors and inclusions you'll probably end up with fairly dull diamonds. That's a lot of compromise just to claim a larger carat size. These are definitely the better bet. <end>  Stunning earings, even better than their clarity rating!  I don't know if this will hold true for every pair of earings. But the ones we received(I ordered them as a gift for the significant other) were absolutlye beautiful. A jeweller asked to see them when we walked into a brick and mortar store looking for a necklace, and was also stunned by their clarity, stating they were even better than their clarity rating here on Amazon. They're a comfortable size(or so says my significant other) and they catch the light like you wouldn't believe.This was my first jewelry purchas on Amazon, and it was a very good one. <end>  review  she loved them but what woman does not love diamonds on some level;the quality of diamonds was exactly as described in advertisements(on certification IGI),though the weight was slightly cut but not past marginal standards set forth in the advertisement. <end>  Not worth much  The earrings are small little peace for everyday wear.I bought the earrings when I saw discount of 98 %,I thought they will be good piece of jewellery, in fact they do not worth more than 500 $. <end>
 B000K2GJZ8  18k Gold Round-Cut Diamond 4-Prong Studs (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, SI1-SI2 Clarity) ||	  Great Deal  I got these for my wife as a Valentines gift and they are beautiful. I see no blemishes and it sparkles. 1/2 cttw was a good size as her first set of diamond earings. Fast shipping and bought them during the 40% off sale. We are both completely happy with the purchase. <end>  diamond earrings for my GF  Let me tell you, these diamond earrings are the best ones! I purchased them for my GF for her B-day and she loved them. They look small when in the box, but when she put them on they looked just right (not too big nor too small), in short, we both were happy with this purchase being my first diamond purchase online and her first diamond earrings ever. Not to mention, the method of delivery was excellent, I ordered them on Friday, and they were delivered the next day Saturday(free of charge). I would recommend these diamond earrings for first and second time buyers. Cheers. <end>  Great Price and Exactly as Advertised!  First time buying a diamonds online with Amazon, what came was exactly as I imagined. Keep up the good work! <end>  Diamond Earrings  I received my diamond stud earrings and was pleasantly surprised. The clarity and sparkle of the earrings are amazing. I also was given a generous discount which was a surprise when I closed the order. I am very happy and would recommend these earrings for anyone shopping for diamonds. Thank you. <end>  Christmas Present  Was ambivalent about purchasing diamonds thru internet sources. Amazon did not dissapoint, and the product reviews on this item helped me select it vs. another product. The earrings did not dissapoint. They were exactly as described, and were a good quality. <end>  First time diamond buyer - the seem very nice!  I bought these for my girlfriend - they seem very nice and the box they came in was decent. 1/2 ct total weight was actually smaller than i had envisioned - just suprised me a little when i opened the box but thats just how big 1/4 ct studs are! Paid 499.00 for the 1/2 cttw in 18k white gold. <end>  No certificate!  Amazon product description talks about diamond certification but the fine print says that no certificate will be provided. I ordered this item and NO certificate was provided.Also, Amazon charges 15% restocking fee for jewelry returns. And all returns need to be insured. So, return becomes super expensive. THINK before you buy jewelry from Amazon.com. You are probably better off buying from a local store. <end>  Not as small as they look  Over all a good purchase. I got these for my wife she likes them. When I seen them I was not very impress with the looks they are bigger then I thought they would from looking at the image. But that's the chance you take when ordering item online. Next time I will just find items that has a few customer reviews. <end>
 B000K2H2D6  14k Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (1/2 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2Clarity) ||	  Know what you are buying...  As someone who sold fine jewelry for three years, I feel I should point out a few things about these earrings. These earrings are almost the worst clarity that you can get. The best diamonds are called flawless and the go down from that to VS to SI to I1, I2, and I3. Diamonds rated with VS or SI have no inclusions that can be seen with the naked eye. I1, I2, and I3 rated diamonds have visible inclusions. Those inclusions can range from milky spots to dark black spots. The best color for a diamond is between D and I. D,E, and F are considered colorless (no tint of yellow). G, H, and I are considered near colorless (generally you can see no yellow tint with these, but I rated diamonds can sometimes look a little yellow depending on how liberal the sellers are with their gradings. J is usually a light yellow. Certified diamonds are proven to have certain characteristics. They have been looked at by gemologists who have rated them. Uncertified diamonds...well, let's just say you should check those out. These studs are uncertified. So, these studs are I1-I2 (included) and they may or may not have a tint of yellow since they are I-J in color. 14k gold is good, but these earrings also don't have screw backs, which keep them safely on an ear so they aren't lost. The store I worked at sold 1/2ct studs of a similar quality for $199. Now, this isn't to say that 1/2ct studs that are I1-2 and I-J can't be pretty. My suggestion, however, is to go to an actual store. Salespeople are motivated to find you the best quality studs for the money you are willing to spend because they do not want the purchase returned (most are on commission and also want you to come back to them as repeat customers). Go in knowing a little bit about diamonds and they will know you expect the best you can get and that you might go elsewhere to buy. Also, $499 will buy you more than what you are getting with this item. Go shop around a little, make a purchase in a store, and if the person receiving the studs doesn't like them they are EASY to return. However, since you have seen them and picked them out in person, you know they look good and they probably won't need to be returned. The recipient will also feel more special because you took the time to find nice ones AND you get perks from buying them in store, such as free jewelry cleanings. These are just my thoughts. I hope they help someone. <end>  Not so great  The diamonds were a little yellowish, they were a little cloudy, and they didn't sparkle like I would have wished. But what do you expect for $300? <end>  Beautiful sparklers  The diamonds are real sparklers. They are simple for daytime wear and sophisticated enough for a night on the town. A good value! <end>  Girlfriend Loves 'em!  Diamonds are naturally occurring stones. That means all of them are different, some more yellow than others and some have minor imperfections. However, these were white, and clear to my untrained eye. I thought these were a bit small for 1/2 carat, but my girlfriend just loves them (and they seem larger on the ear than in the box) and that is what really matters. These are a good value and with Amazon's lenient return policy, I thought "How could I go wrong?" One minor gripe  the backings were too loose and fell off while she was wearing them. Luckily she was able to find the earring in the house, but we had to go and buy new backings (couldn't find them) at the local jewelry store. Amazon [are you listening] should do a better job of ensuring tight fitting backings because they come in different sizes and she would have been really upset if they got lost! <end>  Cheap, but full of black specks.  I thought these stones were fine until I compared them with the equivalently rated stones at several local jewlers. These diamonds were loaded with black specs, like 15-20. The diamonds at my local jewlers' stores contained only two or three black specs visible under a microscope and barely visible with the naked eye. I returned these and bought some from Kay's. They were about 25% more, but the difference was huge. Much more sparkle. <end>  chances are  This is the 3rd review I'm giving. I'll keep it simple. With these earrings you are spared on the packaging as they arrive in a poor box and poor bag. Get past this and the diamonds appear fine without any bad marks and with a good sparkle. Without really knowing what I'm looking at I think they are nice and look very good on my lady. In hindsight I probably should have gotten a bigger stone or more expensive setting. The back of the earrings get loose and may fall off. <end>  Very Poor Quality  I received these earrings for Christmas and my boyfriend was so excited to give them to me. One of them is wonderful (great clarity and cut) while the other one has a huge black speck in the dead center which completely destroys the quality making it look like a shattered piece of glass. I feel so badly because he is so disappointed and I'm afraid his Christmas is ruined! Amazon claims to carefully inspect all items for quality. I can't understand how they'd try to pass this off with the clarity level/rating they claimed it had! At least be honest avbout the quality. These are being returned ASAP! Lesson learned...never buy jewelry online! <end>  Diamond Earrings  I bought 2 pair of 1/2 carat diamond earrings in the middle of December and they are very nice. Then I bought 2 pair of 1/2 carat diamond earrings in the end of December and they are very POOR quality. Very cloudy and I'm not impressed..... <end>  Diamond Stud Earings  Well, I don't wear them, however, my wife was very pleased with her Christmas present. If Mama's happy,everyone's happy. I would definitely endorse shopping on Amazon. In my case, my target was 14k white gold, diamond stud earings. I found them in all shapes, sizes and prices on Amazon. Very pleased. <end>  Little stars  I received my earrings very fast! Nice surprise. They are beautiful. I love them. <end>
 B000K2H3TE  IGI Certified 14k White Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (1 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  can you give no stars??  I was expecting minor imperfections based on description. The earings were dark and blemished in over half of the area of the diamond. They did not sparkle - they look like glass - poorly polished glass.I am extremely disappointed. Plus I just spent $20 to return them with insurance through UPS. <end>  Inclusions are enormous, looks like chunks of gravel!  The diamonds had black inclusions that seemed to occupy a major fraction of the diamonds volume. I expected something that would be visible on close inspection with the naked eye, but these are visible from 5 feet away ! They are the most dominant feature of the diamonds ! I have seem I2s before and needed a loop to see the includions. These are just unacceptable !Pretty much ruined a 50th birthday as a gift, these stones are junk.AVOID ! <end>
 B000K2I0NW  IGI Certified 14k Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (3/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Excellent gift  I gave these to my wife to commemorate the birth of our first child. The price was excellent, and she's loved them. The size was a bit on the "understated" side, with which I wasn't thrilled but should have expected, but she liked that feature in particular and wears them in all kinds of settings. <end>  Very pleased with my purchase  I was nervous buying diamonds online but these diamonds were exactly as described. They had a nice sparkle and for the price paid they definetely met my expectations. I had previously purchased similiar earrings from a local jewelry store (and paid more) that weren't nearly as nice. My girlfriend was very happy with them. <end>  Sparkling!! Beautiful!!!  The earrings are very bright and sparkly. Lots of light play throughout the stones. The pair I received are not cloudy at all. I fooled my ignorant husband into thinking they are CZ (He likes that price better). These earrings could easily cost twice as much.As stated in other reviews; the backs are not tight enough. I would have scored these 5 stars except for that fact. <end>  Dull and not shining  unbelievably dull, it was almost like a cubic zirconia.I had to return this item.At the end I purchased 1 cttw Moissanite earrings.Moissanite has incredible fire.At this price I recommend Moissanite.14k White Gold Moissanite 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1cttw equivalent) <end>  Review of 14k Gold Diamond Stud 3/4 cttw earrings  I gave the earrings as a small present to my lovely wife. She was thoroughly delighted with them, and thought that the diamonds were beautifully cut and very nicely set in the gold studs. <end>  DIAMOND EARRING REVIEW  I received the diamond earrings the other day and was very excited until I opened the package. I must say that I was very disappointed in the size. They are so small! If I was purchasing them for a newborn babe or a child, they would be perfect. They are pretty and have a nice sparkle to them, but the size is NOT what I expected. I purchase them as a Christmas gift for a very special friend. So far, I have not seen any men wearing diamond earings this small. Maybe I was expecting too much. When I looked at the illustration, the earrings looked like they were larger and could be worn by a man or woman. Based on the size, I am not sure if any adult would wear them. I plan to return them and take the time to just go to the jewlry store and see what I am actually purchasing.In all fairness, the earrings are pretty and have a nice sparkle to them. I am not an expert on buying diamonds. I should do my research first then go to the jewlry store...not buy them online from a company I do not know anything about. And, maybe the size of the diamond actually equates to what I paid for them. I have no way of knowing unless I take the time and have a jewler appraise them. <end>  Large inclusions  My husband got these for me for Christmas. The size is just right for me (not too big, not too small), and the color is very clear and without a tinge of yellow or any other color.The only "problem" is the presence of huge inclusions. Husband didn't notice them, but I did. Although the inclusions are relatively large, you'll still have to peer in closely to see them. Otherwise, they sparkle very nicely.My husband is so happy about the studs (he's clueless with respect to jewelry, but I don't really mind), and I'm happy with them, too, because of how he feels about them. I will also be able to wear these casually without having to worry about losing them every time. I know that the nearly-flawless versions cost almost a couple of thousand dollars per pair, and I'd rather get a new Macbook Pro than jewelry anyway (something I'm getting as another Christmas present from husband after Macworld in January).All in all, can't complain, and I love the fact that husband even thought of getting jewelry at all.  ) <end>  One big, one small  Returned the earrings because one was small and one was large -- not even close to the same size. <end>  Earrings  They look worse than a cheap fake pair of earrings. I wouldn't take them for free much less pay 400+ for them. Those are the first & last pair of diamond earrings I buy from here. <end>
 B000K2I2IA  IGI Certified 14k Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (1 1/2 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Happy Ears  I have been incredibly pleased with these earring and they have now become my "every day" earrings - insured at the replacement value, which is far more than the actual cost. One problem is that the back fits better on one earring and I can get it tighter on my ear than the other but at no time do I feel that I am going to lose the one that is slightly loose.I love the shine, the brilliance, the glow and the great feeling they give me. I have received numerous compliments on these earrings and my heart is happy. These were a present to myself for havig dealt with a bad situaiton for over two years and survived. Everyone needs to pamper themselves sometimes - this is a great way to do it. <end>  Delighted!  The earrings are huge and bright. A great price for the size and quality. I wear them everyday! <end>  sparkling sparkles  The earrings were delivered as promised and were absolutely stunning, appraised at more than double the price I paid for them. They are so beautiful, I wear them every day. <end>  Great product; absolutely TERRIBLE UPS service  These are beautiful, better than the pictures! However, they were supposed to be delivered overnight via UPS. 5 !!!! days later, they were located (???) and arrived. I will never buy another product where UPS is the designated shipper. <end>  Show stoppers!  Extremely beautiful earings on and off screen. I didn't think it was possible for my girlfriend to look more beautiful, but these earings really add a different sort of beauty. I do however think that if your going to spend the money on diamond earings, you should get the best. Never settle. 1 carat is the perfect size for diamond earings. I found a different pair that I plan on buying that are even more beautiful than the ones i already bought. They are brilliantly cut round 1 carat diamonds that can't be matched.http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093F4K7M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0093F4K7M&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazon070f-20 <end>
 B000K2K7D8  10k Gold, Round-Cut, Diamond Studs (1/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Good little earrings for the price.  The diamonds were a little dark with carbon, which having been in the jewelry business for many years, I expected for the price. I bought them to wear in second holes in my ears and doubt anyone would notice. <end>  Read CAREFULLY These are I3 Diamonds!  I3 is a category of diamond that in the past would only have been used for industrial diamonds. (e.g. they would be ground up and used to make saw blades) However because of the demand for cheap diamonds, I3 diamonds are now being cut and used in jewelry. This is why the prices for certain types of diamond jewelry have become incredibly cheap.Diamonds are graded as follows  FL, IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3The grading description for I3 is as follows  "I3 diamonds have large and extremely easy to see inclusions that typically impact the brilliance of the diamond, as well as having inclusions that are often likely to threaten the structure of the diamond."I am all for look over perfection, but I would think twice before buying a diamond graded below SI2, unless this is for your young daughter who might lose them somewhere... <end>  Surprised!  I ordered these earrings, usually $110, for $65 during a sale on Amazon. The reviews were mixed so I wasn't sure what to expect. They are GREAT! I have better than 20/20 eyesight and I can't see any specks or color. They look like very nice diamonds. The backs seem secure so far (there is a noise when I click them on as if they are tight), but I'd be happy even if I had to buy a different pair of backs. Actually, I bought these to replace a pair of studs I lost (a gift from an ex) and these are larger (3mm or a little more, hard to say) and nicer looking --I saw the receipt and the originals were much more expensive! Awesome buy!!! <end>  Beautiful sparkles  I purchased these for my married daughter for Christmas. They came today and I think she will love them. Yes, they are tiny...if there are inclusions...I can't see them with my naked eye, but then I'm almost 60. lol They sparkle beautifully with no cloudiness. If she doesn't love them as much as I do, I'll keep them for myself! Ha! <end>  Didn't expect much and got less  I knew that I was ordering poor quality diamonds and that is what I got. They don't sparkle and you can't even tell they are diamonds. They look like white rocks. I was misled by other customers' positive reviews. <end>  Not happy  These earrings made me very unhappy when they arrived in the mail. I bought them for my wife as a christmas gift and I couldn't bear the thought of giving them to her. I was very disappointed by the discoloring of the diamonds! <end>  Small...Tiny...very!  This is the first time I've purchased jewelry from Amazon, and it didn't go very well.The earrings were very very very, let me say, very small. They were so small, that one was wrapped in tissue and I thought it was just shipping packaging and almost threw it out.The picture they have for this item, should seriously be removed and updated with a more accurate photo, that show's the true size. These were less then 1/4 of an inch in size.- I just wanted to come back with an update... On 12/21, I went shopping in the stores and was able to get 1/4 carat ear rings that were much much much, nicer and BIGGER then this product for much CHEAPER. This product is a complete rip off and should be removed from Amazon! <end>  Simple but elegant  For a simple set these are great. Not to big, but they do have a great sparkle. <end>  Not worth the money  Clearly this seems like a great deal, but trust me its not. I would never recommend these earrings to anyone, they were not accurately described! I would have been better off buying diamond earring studs at Wal-mart. The diamond was full of black marking and was not even semi-clear. <end>  Disappointed  Bought these for my wife, half of the reviews here were good, so I thought maybe the other reviewers were just too picky. Unfortunately, had to mail these earrings back as soon as I got them. They looked terrible! I would never give them to my wife. The diamonds weren't clear at all, they looked white. I knew what I was buying - small cheap earrings with low grade diamonds - so I wasn't expecting too much. But these earrings were just unacceptable! I've seen jewelry with diamonds of the same grade before, and they weren't nearly as bad as these. <end>  Pretty  I purchased these earrings to replace a set for my 4 1/2 yr old daughter. They are smaller than I thought, looking at the pic online. However, they will suffice for her liking. The price was worth it! I'm pleased. <end>  great anniversary  I gave these to my wife for an anniversary present she loved them. Of course they are diamonds, what woman doesn't like getting diamonds. <end>  Happy Customer  I am very happy with this product, arrived SUPER fast and was as promised, doesn't get much better! <end>  just ok  I really didn't expect much out of these considering the grade and quality. I bought them for my second earring holes. I must say that I have only worn them once. <end>  suitable for my purposes  Amazon why you no tell me this not unobtainium?! I mean shiii what kinda weird metal dis be????? You tell me dis be unobtainiumgrrrrrrrr <end>  Don't waste your money  I got these earrings as a gift and OMG..... there are HORRIBLE quality. They are dark with carbon and don't sparkle AT ALL. I actually cryed when I opened the present and saw them. If you have to give these as a gift, do not waste your money. Your GF or wife will not be happy if she knows anything at all about jewelery. I would rather get nothing at all then get these earrings. I wouldn't even show them to friends and family because I felt like my BF didn't care enough about me to get me something of quality. <end>  Good starter set  Our 13 year old has been doing a good job taking care of her jewelry. These ear rings were the next step. They're tiny, but just the fact that they're real diamonds made a big impression. <end>  Earrings don't look like the picture  I was very disappointed in these earrings. I was really conflicted whether to get them or not after reading the reviews. They are not sparkly like the picture shows. They are more milky and not shiny at all. I say don't waste your money! <end>  Not worth it at all  Very poor for the money.. one was great looking and the other was so cloudy that you could not even tell it was a diamond. I do love Amazon though, I shipped it back and they have the best return and refund time. <end>  Very pleased indeed  They are very small no doubts about it.They are also very beautiful and we are very pleased.Hope you guys enjoy as much! Happy Shopping to everyone out there !!! <end>  Super fast Delivery! 10/10  I recieved my earrings within 4 days & i am in Australia! & they are everything they described. I am extremely happy with the whole experience & would buy from them again. <end>   )  I did not expect that stones will be so small.But in general looks great <end>  Bad quality  What i got is really bad service and bad quality. The product quality that I got is much different from what shown in the picture. Second thing is, I bought a pair of this and each of them are in different size. One is smaller than the other. I planned to give this as a gift. But after such a long wait and by seeing this, feel so upset about it. <end>  Yay!  These were a little present to myself and they are wonderful! Color and sparkle is great and they are slightly bigger than I expected. I would definetly reccommend these for the price! <end>  10K White Gold Roung Diamond Studs  these are earrings are perfect for extra holes in your ear. They are not big, but small enough for extra holes. I like them. <end>  Great Budget friendly gift!  I just got these earrings for my mom for Christmas. They are so beautiful! I read the reviews after I had purchased them and I got nervous. I was fully intending to send them back. I was expecting the worst! I was pleasantly suprised. These are great earrings. They sparkle and are clear. They are smaller, but they have good bang for the buck! I would recommend them for someone who wants to get a wow gift, on a not-so-wow budget. They are dainty and would be great for any woman who wants a little sparkle. I highly recommend them! I would like to add I only paid $89 for them, which was a great price! <end>  Don't buy diamonds off the internet  My dear husband bought me these diamond earrings for xmas to replace one from a set that he'd bought me a few years ago that I'd lost. He's usually a very savvy consumer so I'm shocked he would buy diamonds off the internet. They're not terrible, and if you're one of those guys who just want to buy "any old" diamonds for your girl, they'll probably work. But diamonds are really something that should be purchased in person where you can inspect them yourself for clarity & quality. The ones I got were a little cloudy and unimpressive. But I kept them because I didn't want to hurt my husbands feelings. BUT...PLEASE, gentelmen, go to a jewelry store and look at the diamonds if you're buying them for a lady! <end>  SO DISSAPOINTED =(  I ORDERED THESE FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AFTER READING GOOD REVIEWS. THE PICTURE OF THE EARRINGS IS VERY DECEIVING. AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THEY MAY HAVE SHIPPED ME OPALS. NOW I DONT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO RETURN THEM AND FIND A NEW GIFT BY CHRISTMAS. THE EARRINGS DO NOT SPARKLE AT ALL AND THE COLOR IS WHITE.. NO CLARITY AT ALL...I AM FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE REGULAR RETAIL PRICE OF THESE IS OVER $400.OH WELL.. IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.... WELL, WE ALL KNOW THE REST OF THE SAYING.HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ALLSigned,A very dissapointed Mom <end>  Crystal Clear These Are Not  Caveat Emptor  Let the buyer beware! Do not let the mock-up images fool you. When this item arrived, I was startled by the complete disconnect between the actual product and the product picture.Being a confessedly nave purchaser, I did not consult an independent jewelry resource to clarify what the technical description of this product was. I went by the image, and boy was I surprised! These jewels have coal specs so large that you wonder whether it can legitimately be called a diamond earring! The cut, additionally, is not accurately represented in the images. You'll find that the gold mount is dramatically larger than the product image would lead you to believe, and the diamond's cut is not as attractive or complex.Overall, a deeply dissatisfying purchase. <end>  much smaller than expected  I didn't expect much, considering price, for the diamond. However, it was very poor quality and the setting was so tiny I could hardly get hold of it to put in ear. I returned it. <end>  Not worth the money...  These have got to be the worst earrings ever. The earrings look nothing like the picture shown. I was embarrassed to show these to my wife. These should be removed from Amazon as soon as possible. <end>  Not what I wanted  The one earring look like a diamond, the other one looks like plastic.I have always trusted Amazon when ordering jewelry but this time was a bust.I will use a little better care in ordering jewelry on line from now on.One of the earrings has clarity, but the other earring has a dull look.I have ordered jewelry from Amazon before and never had a problem.Sincerely,Gene Bishop <end>  great little diamonds for the price  I bought these to wear in my second holes. I had lost the earrings I had bought many years ago for over $300, and thought I would give these a try. They are very pretty and sparkly, and if there are any imperfections I did not notice. These are small, but a good deal. Nice and shiny too. I would definitely recommend these to someone who is looking for a small pair of diamond studs for a good price. <end>  ITTY BITTY, Not Clear, And women will be ashamed to wear them  This was a bad gift.1) They are so small for being a quarter ct.2) They look horrible on my love cause you can't even see them in her ears.3) They are cloudy diamonds.4) There is no shine.You are better off buying fake diamonds. <end>  earrings  10k White Gold Round Diamond Stud Earrings (1/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), easy to order, received on time, pleasant way to shop <end>  first diamond studs  These earrings are nice, I have $50 in gift receipts and this was on sale for $110, so for $60 is good, but not $110. They are not the clearest diamond, but they are still nice. <end>
 B000K2MDDU  10k Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Studs (1/2 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  In Love  These are the most beautiful earrings, and I receive so so so many compliments on them whenever I wear them. <end>  Beautiful!!  This past Christmas I bought a pair of diamond earrings the same size from a quality jewelry store. I could kick myself for spending all the extra money!!!! These are beautiful, Good deal!!!! <end>  Horrible!!!!!!!  Extremely P'd Off!!! I ordered these on Friday Feb. 10th. and got suckered into subscribing to Amazon Prime with the expectation of having 2 Day delivery.(I wanted these by Feb. 14th)So my Fiance was waiting by the door like a puppy for a week! Finally got these Sh***y diamonds on Feb.17th.Now my expectations were not too high considering the price.But, I was hoping they would at least look like eachother.One was noticeably bigger and cloudy,with what appears to be black sand throughout.The other was smaller ,more yellow with a big piece of "black sand" toward the bottom.These do not shine at all! I wouldn"t let my dog wear these!Not even worth the box they came in!I'll be sending these back,cancelling my Prime account,and visiting Overstock a little more!Amazon you suck! <end>  perfect  I purchased these earrings as an 18th birthday gift for my daughter. The size is perfect. The quality is excellent. The price was fabulous. My daughter loved them - she said "these are absolutely amazing". <end>  Beautiful  I love these . They sparkle beautifully and I get a lot of comments on them. Also they are an amazing price <end>  Very small with a black spot on one  I was surpised at the size (small) when I got them. Diamonds did not look that great either and one had a black dot on the inside of the diamond. Sent them back immediately. <end>  Sooooo pretty!  I bought these as a present for myself, and I just love them! They were less expensive than similarly sized diamond earrings, and they look great on my ears. Could not be more pleased with this purchase. <end>  Fashion and quality  These earrings are just as any woman would want. The quality and brillant clarity is just perfect.Wouldn't go wrong in purchasing this item! <end>  sparkle sparkle sparkle  These were a gift for Christmas and they are beautiful, just the right size and the sparkle is unbelieveable, just as good as any dept. or jewerly store but lower priced!! <end>  More then worth it!!  I went out a day before and bought a pair of smaller carat for about the same money. I decided to buy these and I think they are SO beautiful!!They are perfect to me, not just the earrings but the price as well. I took back the other ones to the store I got it from. These are more then worth it.My earrings have very small inclusions in them and they do sparkle in and out of the light. No diamond is flawless and these are cut in a way that it picks up the light and makes it look more then I paid for them.I will buy more of my diamonds from amazon in the future. <end>  disappointed  if I wanted mediocre quality for this price I could've gone to virtually any jewelry store. I thought one of the advantages of shopping on Amazon was a better deal. I guess when it comes to shopping for jewelry I'll stick with my local gemologist. <end>  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY  The picture of these diamonds is very,very misleading. If you are not a diamond expert and don't know what the clarity and and color codes really mean don't trust the picture. These things look like dull glass. Bought them as a Christmas gift for my wife and I am sending them back. Again don't let the pictures fool you. <end>  earrings were mix matched  I had bought these earrings for my daughter and was very disappointed when they arrived. One earring was very noticeably larger than the other. although my money was quickly refunded upon the return of the earrings, I am very apprehensive about ordering jewelry through Amazon from now on. <end>  Not great, but worth the gamble.  Shipping was great as always with Amazon. However, the stones almost looked like rocks instead of diamonds. Very gray in color. I purchased these because the description showed them having similar diamond qualities to earrings that I previewed at a local jeweler. With similar qualities, the diamonds at the jeweler sparkled and were crystal clear, so for substantially less, I tried the Amazon Earrings. The diamonds from Amazon were dull, had visible large inclusions and were just all together unappealing. For the price, I figured I would give it a shot as some of the reviews were great and some were bad. Clearly I got one of the bad batches. I'd suggest chancing it if you have the time to wait for shipping. I ended up spending $200 more on the nicer looking earrings, so if you get lucky and get one of the nice pairs I have read about from Amazon, it would be well worth the gamble of the shipping charge. Don't be shocked if you get some ugly earrings though. <end>  Great Gift  I got these as a gift for my wife. They arrived fast, and were in a nice wooden jewelry box. My wife opend it up and got tears in her eyes because she loved them so much. That is worth 5 stars for me! <end>  You get what you pay for  Wife loves them and that's all that counts. The stones are not as bright and clear as the ones I paid double for, but that's to be expected. Nicely mounted and attractive, in my opinion anyway. I saw one review where a person was complaining about not knowing what the clarity and inclusion codes were before purchase. I really didn't either but about 10 minutes research on the internet solves the problem. Perfect for a teenage daughter or, if you are lucky like me, a low maintenance wife. <end>  My Wife loves them!  For the price you can't go wrong, plus my Wife loves them. Which is all that matters! I haven't noticed anything wrong with them and neither has she. If you do some research on color and clarity then you will understand what to expect. I was impressed because the diamond clarity and color were better than described. I'm not a professional jeweler and don't have all the equipment but my eye and my Wifes' is good enough. <end>  Pretty good  I bought these for a woman I was seeing for her birthday. She had always wanted a pair of princess cut earrings. She absolutely loved the earrings and wore them all the time. She ultimately lost one of them and our relationship has since ended but for that time, she found them to be perfect. And that made it all the worthwhile.If you're looking for a nice pair of diamond earrings without breaking the bank, then I'd recommend these. I was extremely wary about purchasing jewelry online as you have no idea the quality you will get beyond stock photos. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the earrings. My only gripe was that I didn't like the sticker attached to the bottom of the box. <end>  DIAMOND EARINGS  Earring are very grey in color and of poor quality. No sparkle at all. Would not recomend purchasing. Ended up returning. <end>

Perfect for a baby baptism gift, especially from a god parent, or very close friend. If I needed I would order it again <end>  Very disappointed  This baptism bracelet was a sad disappointment for me. I know that it came from a vendor other than Amazon, however, the picture depicted is not what I received. The bracelet was not attached to the lovely note card as shown, which I dearly wanted as a keepsake. Also, the bracelet itself is actually sized for a baby. Not a girl. Very disappointed. Will be returning it. <end>
 B000K2SMYE  Amazon.com  Christmas Bulb Earrings (fuchsia)  Clothing ||	  Great touch of Chirstmas cheer  I bought these for the holidays. They are really fun earrings. The red is nice and bright, and I got a lot of complements while wearing them. They are large, but lightweight, and comfortable to wear all day-I even forgot I was wearing them at times. They are fragile, but came in nice, clear, hard plastic box. This kept them protected during shipping, and comes in handy for storing them safely when they are not being worn. <end>  Love them  These are great Christmas or Holiday earrings !I will buy more for gifts for friends and family. <end>
 B000K36DCQ  Oval Shape White Cubic Zirconia Ring Size 11 in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  DONT GET THIS RING  I HAD TO CHANGE MY REVIEW FOR THIS RING. ITS NOT STERLING SILVER, IT FADED AFTER A FEW WEEKS, AND CANNOT BE SHINED. DONT BUY THIS RING. I COULDNT CHANGE MY STAR RATING, OR I WOULD HAVE RATED IT 1 STAR, ONLY BECAUSE THIS RING DIDNT SHATTER INTO LITTLE PEICES. <end>
 B000K38AZO  Radiant Cut 2.00 carat Amethyst Ring Size 13 in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful!  I received this ring in a timely manor and when I opened the box my breath was taken away! It is so beautiful! I bought this ring as a purity ring for myself and I could not be happier!! Feels true to size and everything!! I just simply love it!! I would not hesitate to purchase this ring if I were y'all!! <end>
 B000K3C6LS  Oval Shape 2.25 carat London Blue Topaz Ring Size 11 in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful ring!  I am very pleased with the quality of this item. The London Blue Topaz is the perfect size,with nice clarity and color. A new favorite at a reasonable price. <end>  NOT London Blue Topaz By Picture  If the color of this stone is just as pictured on the web, this is NOT a London Blue Topaz, which is a much deeper color and has more value than that of other topaz colors. <end>
 B000K3ESPK  Copper Hoop Earrings, Hammered, 2.5 Inch Diameter ||	  Simple drama  As a person with auburn hair, I find that copper jewelry sets off my coloring. These earrings are exactly as described. They are dramatic without being overwhelming , and are appropriate for any occasion. The hammered effect is attractive and they are lightweight. Artistry in a less expensive metal is rare, and these earrings are well crafted. <end>  Cooper Hoops to Die For  These beauties are light and lovely, just what I was looking for. They DO tarnish with time, however, but are easy to brighten with a bit of polish and a soft cloth. <end>  JINGLE JANGLE  Adorable earrings. I wish they were bigger, much bigger as I am a big earring gal but I can not take anything away from them. Great earrings! <end>
 B000K41OXI  Gracie's Choice Resin Beaded Pendant Necklace ||	  Be prepared to go to a craft store....edited  ...to buy a clasp for this necklace if you are over the age of 2 and want to actually wear it. Unfortunately, this necklace has no clasp, (as seen in the picture), but is not long enough to be pulled over an adult sized head.I am not giving it a lower ranking because I could have paid attention to the item length in the description; however, it is annoying I am going to have to do work on it to wear it or send it back.The pendant itself is not completely yellow like as seen in the picture. The pendant is the color of spilled honey which has started to crystallize. The smaller beads are the same color as the picture; the larger ones are more amber colored.EDIT TO ADD -I can, in fact, get this over my head by dipping my face forward and rolling the necklace over the back of my skull. Good thing I don't have the kind of hair that is easily tangled. <end>
 B000K41OY2  Fabric Threaded Multibead Long Collar Necklace ||	  Not even worth the low price  I bought this as a gift, after having some great success with other Nvie items. The ribbon on this necklace is frayed in many places and it just looks cheap. Since it was so inexpensive, I didn't think it was worth trying to return it. <end>
 B000K41OZQ  Amanda's Choice Bone Beaded Collar Necklace ||	  Does not look as nice in reality  Really liked the looks of it on the picture, but was very disappointed to see it in reality. The quality of the cuts in the bone is very poor, it looks sloppy and cheapens an otherwise interesting design. <end>
 B000K4U9QQ  Phantom of the Opera Phantom Mask 14K Gold Earrings ||	  deceptive  the earrings look way larger then they actually are...perfect for a baby's ear but not for an adult woman...very disappointed for price charged...do not feel they are worth it...I am returning them. <end>
 B000K7CZ4M  Retro Yellow Amber Pin ||	  Retro Amber Pin  I rated this pin as not worth the money and that it looked cheaper than advertised. The Advertisement still states that there are no reviews. What is the use of giving feedback if it is not put out there for all to see? I am disapointed with the product more now than ever. I had waited too long to return it which is my fault but others should know so that they do not make the same mistake. <end>
 B000K7F5OY  14k Gold Men's Bezel-Set Moissanite Ring (1cttw equivalent), Size 10 ||	  Bezel-Set Moissanite Men's Ring  I purchased this ring recently at a good price with the product promotion discount. This is well made and beutiful ring for men. <end>
 B000K7GO94  Silver Diamond Initial Pendant "Z" with Silk Cord ||	  Pendant OK - Cord is NOT  The pendant itself is pretty; however, the cord has no clasp. The cord comes packaged separately with the pendant and it's just a long piece of silk string with a knot on one end. Since this is supposed to be a close fitting necklace like a choker, there's little string left to tie. Further, you'd have to tie and untie it every time you want to wear it (hassle) because it's too short to tie once and fit over your head. Since this is a gift that would be most inconvenient to the wearer, I now have to buy a separate cord with a clasp and hope that I can fit it through the hoop that holds the pendant. <end>
 B000K7IVF4  Completely Handcrafted - Designer Sterling Silver Hologram Tiger Eye Hook Earrings ||	  Pleased in Arizona  My daughter loves Tiger Eye jewerly and I was thrilled to find these and she was thrilled to recieve them. <end>
 B000KA8ZKM  NFL Dallas Cowboys Rubber Cord Logo Necklace ||	  Haven't worn it yet  Rubber cord still bent out of whack, but the piece is beautiful. We cowgirls just can't represent enough. Add it to your collection girls. Save a horse, ride a cowboy. <end>  Cowboys Necklace  The necklace is a little larger and a more flimsy than expected. However, if you are only wearing it for game day attire, works perfect. <end>
 B000KA92PE  NFL Washington Redskins Rubber Cord Logo Necklace ||	  Pleased  This was exactly what I needed. This was a prize for child's fantasy football contest. The winner received this wonderful gift. This purchase made the children excited for the exact reason why I bought it. Thanks! <end>
 B000KB9B2C  Sterling Silver Garnet Ring by Sajen, Size 6 ||	  Absolutely Gorgeous...  Of all the Sajen rings I have (approx. 16), this is probably the most beautiful one I own. The stone is really unbelievable -- a very dark red -- and the faceting of the stone is spectacular. The silver of the ring is also exquisite, both in color and in its high polish. The silver is almost a white silver, it is that bright. And the weight of the ring is substantial; as with all Sajen rings, the band is very thick and sturdy. As for the design -- there are silver swirls not only on the band, but also on the vertical sides of the gemstone setting, which you cannot really see in the photo, but which is hinted at in the description. This ring is stunning enough for evening wear, yet it is such a neat size, you could easily wear it to the office. <end>
 B000KBBBD4  Sterling Silver Aventurine and Iolite Post Earrings by Sajen ||	  Lovely...  These earrings are of fine craftmanship and have shiney, colorful stones. They are just as described. You will not be disappointed. <end>
 B000KBC90S  Hoop Charm Peace Sign Earrings - Clearance Final Sale ||	  Sterling Silver Hoop Charm Peace Sign Earrings  Earrings came quickly and as described. Hard to find these little peace sign earrings in a style that is not obnoxious. Perfect gift for 70's sister. <end>
 B000KBDFV0  Sterling Silver and Amethyst Ring by Sajen, Size 6 ||	  Wonderful Ring!  Great quality! Love the ring. I have large fingers (size 9), but this ring actually makes my fingers look great!Thanks! <end>  At last, a truly purple amethyst!  I had heard of the Sajen mark of quality. But, the designs have always been too ornate for my taste - until I was fortunate enough to have found this beautiful ring. It is a lovely shade of purple with a magnificent cut. The size is large, about a 1/2" to 3/4" from top to bottom (and I like to wear a big "statement" ring on my right hand, despite my petite frame.) The design was refreshingly streamlined with no unnecessary flowers or squiggles. There is an extremely generous amount of silver used. The stone is well protected on all four sides (I know because I accidentally dropped it in the sink - no damage at all!) The thick band in the back makes it extremely comfortable, and I am not afraid to do work while I wear it.Here is one case where the ring is nicer than it's picture. I can only suggest, from my experience, to order a 1/2 size up. My particluar ring was tight and had to be worn on an undesignated finger. I really didn't mind! Sajen, "Please design a few more pieces that are as streamlined as this - I had been looking for an amethyst ring like this for a very long time." Thank you! <end>  I agree!  Definitley a winner, looks as described, very eye catching. Though the stone is not as colorful, it's received positive comments and i love wearing it. <end>  Balinese Beauty  This is probably the most conservative ring you'll ever see from Sajen (Offerings, the Balinese design/manufacturing company). It is large and the amethyst is, too, but it's not overstated because of the simplicity of the design. Sajen puts A LOT of silver in their pieces, good gems and a smooth, comfortable finish on the finger. Quality stuff. OK, so I'm a big fan of theirs - I guess it shows! <end>
 B000KBDFYC  Sterling Silver Shell Ring by Sajen, Size 6 ||	  cool ring but bottom is open like a toe ring  Bottom of shank is open like a toe ring. Not disclosed in description. Not comfortable so I returned. Otherwise, very pretty and well built. <end>
 B000KBDG4Q  Sterling Silver Garnet Ring by Sajen, Size 5 ||	  Absolutely Gorgeous...  Of all the Sajen rings I have (approx. 16), this is probably the most beautiful one I own. The stone is really unbelievable -- a very dark red -- and the faceting of the stone is spectacular. The silver of the ring is also exquisite, both in color and in its high polish. The silver is almost a white silver, it is that bright. And the weight of the ring is substantial; as with all Sajen rings, the band is very thick and sturdy. As for the design -- there are silver swirls not only on the band, but also on the vertical sides of the gemstone setting, which you cannot really see in the photo, but which is hinted at in the description.

 B000KBGHOC  Sterling Silver Breast Cancer Awareness CZ Earrings ||	  Sterling Silver Breast Cancer Awareness CZ Earrings  I was looking for earrings for my wife and two friends as a memento of their making the Avon Breast Cancer Walk in Chicago. Surprisingly, I found many inexpensive jewelry items on line but little of better quality. These are still relatively low-priced but are attractive and well-made. They were a hit with the three women. And part of the profits go to breast cancer charities. Plus Eve's Addiction got them to me in only two days with just regular shipping. <end>  breast cancer awareness cz earrings  Such great earrings for the price and they shipped out so quickly! I bought a few pairs for my daughters because my mother in law is struggling with breast cancer. They love them and never take them off. <end>  Earrings  I bought these for my granddaughter and I was surprised on just hownice they were for the money, only thing is I'm worried the posts may be a little weak if your not careful using them. <end>
 B000KBGHYW  Black Murano Glass Heart Pendant with Bronze Accents ||	  Beautiful  It is very beautiful but dont let it fall! hehe because It fell from my hands and broke the little thing where it hangs, thang god my dad glued it and it is now ok but it is very delicate! <end>
 B000KBGIOG  Vintage Style Sterling Silver Filigree Flower Ring ||	  Love it  This ring is very pretty, soft and feminine. I wear it everyday and get lots of compliments. It is a somewhat large ring so I wouldn't wear any other rings on the hand I wear this one on. It was worth the money. <end>
 B000KBGKWG  Chanda's Gold Band with Double Row Cubic Zirconias ||	  nice for the price  I have been looking for a nice ring to wear on my right hand and I found this one after many tries. This ring is beautiful and it looks like each little diamond has been secured in place so hopefully the diamonds will not fall out- as with previous rings- Sparkly and looks good on petite fingers.Update--- diamonds fall out and gold turns off color-- Oh well- you get what you pay for,,,,, <end>
 B000KBH4EE  Platinum Prong-Set Engagement Ring Setting with Round Sidestones (1/3 cttw) ||	  I had a great experience with Amazon engagement rings  I was a little worried about buying a diamond engagement ring online. But the price was great compared to what I was looking at in local jewelry stores. And I really liked the ability on Amazon to consider different characteristics and chose from a wide variety of diamonds. I was able to purchase a much nicer diamond engagement ring than I would have been able to afford from a local store. This setting was beautiful and exactly as described. The sidestones beautifully accented the center stone. The center diamond was secure in the setting and the ring came in a beautiful wood jewelry box. My fiance loved it. I am very happy with my experience with buying a diamond from Amazon. <end>
 B000KBJ7GC  Stainless Steel Scorpio Design Inverted Band with Cutout Tribal Accents ||	  Tribal Scorpion laser-cut ring  I really like this product ! The design is awesome, the price...way lower than I expected to pay for something of great quality ! I recommend this product for anyone who is interested in this kind of thing ! <end>
 B000KBPNCO  Stainless Steel High Polish Spinner Style Black Flat Band ||	  i love this ring  It was easy to order, it showed up quick, all in all it was enjoyable experience. I love the look of the ring, and its a great addition to the ones i already wear. Only thing is i wish it was a bit thicker. Other than that, i love this ring. <end>
 B000KD1DP8  Sardelli - 14k Tear Drop Dangle Earrings ||	  Great everyday earring!  I am always loosing earrings, so I have decided to only buy Lever Back earrings from now on. I lost one of my everyday earrings on a trip recently, so I was looking for a pair of 14K gold Lever Back earrings to wear daily. The Sardelli - 14K Tear Drop Dangle is perfect. It is light weight and I can't loose them as easily because they are lever backs!!! <end>
 B000KDP4MQ  14K Gold Plated Sterling Silver Oval Red CZ Ring ||	  A stunning addition to my jewelry collection!  I was very pleased to receive the ring and wore it with my gold and red stone jewelry set the next day. I hope to find more products from Hope Chest. If this ring is a sample of their typical quality, style, and value, I'll be purchasing many items from them! Thank you for being a responsible, high quality merchant! Please publish more information about other jewelry products with large colored CZ stones! Thanks, Hope Chest, please keep your product lines full. <end>
 B000KDURLO  14k White Gold Blue Topaz & Diamond Accent Side Stones Ring, Size 7 ||	  Lovely ring  Many times with jewelry, what you see on the internet screen is nothing like what it looks like when you receive the item. This is not the case with this ring. It is beautiful and very shiny. The topaz is a nice size and the white gold is generous, not thin like on some lower-cost rings. Great deal! <end>  Even better than expected  I bought this ring for my niece's graduation gift, and she adores it. She wears it everyday. It is just beautiful, and still modern enough for a teenager. The quality is better than I expected. <end>  Great buy!  I ordered this ring and love it! The setting is trim and the bezel set allows the stone to sit securely on the finger. The color of the stone (clear blue) reminds me of crystal clear water-cool for summer- the 14K white gold setting compliments the stone. The two diamonds at the sides are very small (like pin heads) and don't add much, but the stone and setting don't need anything more anyway. I highly recommend this ring- especially with the white gold setting- it's a great bargain. <end>
 B000KELFFU  Amethyst CZ Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Gorgeous!!  These earrings, while small (1.5"), are absolutely beautiful! I had my doubts based on the inexpensive price, but I am more than pleased! The amethysts are beautiful (true to the color in the picture), and the earrings overall are well made and look much more expensive than they really are. Only one small problem, one of the earrings is slightly defective, but I called Eve's Addiction (toll free to CT) and they are shipping a pair out tomorrow free of charge, along with a pre-paid return label. The company couldn't have been easier to deal with; it took me about 30 seconds to arrange getting a new pair shipped. I am seriously considering buying these same earrings in different colors; that's how much I like them! Great to wear to weddings this summer! <end>
 B000KELFMS  Elegant Sterling Silver CZ Floating Pearl Earrings ||	  Quality not what I expected  These look nice, however I had to send them back the first time because they were scratched. When I received the second pair, one of the clasps was damaged. I was able to fix it so it was usable since at that point I needed a nice pair of earrings for my wedding rehearsal dinner and did not have time to send them back AGAIN! The company did offer to replace them again. I will definitely look elsewhere next time. <end>  good  Very nice pair of earrings. Shipping was very fast would definetly order from this company again. <end>
 B000KEONWM  Southwestern Wolf and Wolf Paw Arrowhead Pendant in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, #10364 ||	  Quality Product but is it manly enough?  This is a quality product. It's well made and looks good. Although its big enough, it could be a little bigger. Not sure if its that manly a pendant but I am happy with it.I'm hoping that ladies that dig wolves and Indian heritage pendants will be drawn to it and me while I'm wearing it. I posted a picture so you can be the judge.I also noticed that this item gets sold out alot. This has happen twice while it was in my wish list. <end>  perfect  Item was just what I was looking for!! A very quality and nice product! And the service from Aazon was very good. <end>
 B000KFMSSC  24kt Gold Plated Pink 6mm Round Cubic Zirconia Belly Ring ||	  pretty but didn't last  This is a unique and quality product. It isn't often that you find gold belly jewelry. My main way of judging quality is simple...I have lost the balls of 6 bellybutton rings since I had my son, as he kicked them out when he'd lie on my chest. Since I've been wearing this ring, that hasn't been a problem. It resists even the most squirmy of newborns.Updated, two months later. The gold plating has rubbed off the ring and it has turned black from skin contact. I won't buy another gold-plated piece of belly jewelry. <end>
 B000KFOWMM  Reversible Light Blue Single Gem Tribal Belly Button Ring ||	  Enhancement to belly button  Comfortable belly button ring that adds a little pizzazz to the midriff. Tattoos radiating out from the midsection also radiate in to focus on this little jewel. <end>  Cute  Its really cute but it presses around the belly button, scratching along the sides of my stomach. If you have a really flat stomach or have a short percing then you should be ok, but if you don't then I would find something that dangles rather than is wide and flat. <end>
 B000KFUBWC  Powell Mission Oak Jewelry Armoire ||	  Jewelry Armoire  I love this. Much larger than any armoires available in local stores. Felt lined drawers. Lots of cubbies in several of the drawers. Arrived much sooner than anticipated. Packaging was wonderful, layer upon layer of protection. <end>  A nice armoire!  I purchased this jewelry armoire as a gift for my wife. Unfortunately, the first unit was damaged in shipping. I then sent it back for a replacement. The second unit had some major production flaws that made it unacceptable. We finally received one that was not damaged and had no flaws. My wife loves the unit. It was a bit complicated to assemble but not horrible. The problems with the first two units caused me headaches due to the repackaging and reshipping requirements. However, the vendor paid all of the shipping costs and were very easy to work with. Again, it is a very nice unit, but beware of shipping and quality control issues. <end>  Not constructed well and not worth the money.  I, like most of you, carefully examined the reviews on this product and, after reading many, I made the purchase here on Amazon. The item arrived exactly when stated and the box was in very good shape. I opened the box and the armoire is nicely covered with styrofoam all over and some wrapping material. I carefully cut the box and looked at the front of the jewelry armoire and was shocked. Both upper joints above the top drawer were broken. Upon careful examination these were broken due to the design and construction techniques, not the shipping. It was one dowel and a staple holding the front edge to the sides. No wonder the joints came apart. What was also disappointing is someone had knowingly tried to fix the left joint using a wood filler and done a poor job. In addition, the bottom legs were scraped and a junk missing. The unit did not stand level on our wood floors and the side doors were warped - one inward and one outward. One of the side door magnetic closers was also broken. I was frustrated, but I am a DIY, so I took the unit apart and fixed it myself (correctly). I removed the plastic pieces on the legs and replaced them with bigger felt pads, so it stands level now. Now, my wife loves it. I would not recommend this to others, as it is a design issue and I cannot see how this will not be present in many of the delivered units. I do not believe that the side wood doors are hard wood either. This unit is not worth over $200.00. It is roomy and nice, but the design is flawed. <end>  Finally, it is all together!`  I live alone, but was able to get it out of the box and do the minimal assembly required. After dusting and polishing with good furniture oil, it looks great in my bedroom. There was a small corner piece broken off, but I was able to repair it with wood glue and touch-up. Finally, all my jewelry is organized and findable - a place in the drawers for earrings, rings and bracelets, and hanging space in the two side panels for necklaces. It's terrific! <end>  Attractive piece, but not heirloom quality...  While from a distance this is an attractive piece it is your typical "Made in China" quality with (upon close inspection) poor craftsmanship. These include visible glue overage, joinery imperfections, & missing screws. I am not dissatisfied as I believe the price represents the quality. Just understand there is not a single piece of wood in this unit as it is manufactured entirely from particle board. <end>  Nice version of this cabinet!  When I shopped for this for my wife in November '09, there were lots of similar products available via Amazon and elsewhere. I finally chose this one based on the price, the likelihood of its matching our other furniture and finish, and some nice features like the felt lining, mirrored lid, and various storage areas. I ended up having an issue with how the shipping costs were presented, and the vendor was very easy to work with. The item arrived promptly and, though in a very heavy box, required almost no assembly once I got it upstairs. It's nicely finished, has lined drawers with a quality feel, and has a nice assortment of storage drawers, doors, and under the mirrored lid. My wife (and therefore both of us) are very happy with this purchase. <end>  Mission Style Jewelry Amoire  Very nice style, item shipping and delivered with no problems.Heavy to move around but quality of drawers and hardware nice! <end>  Not a scratch-but.....  I am enjoying my new armoire. It arrived earlier than expected. It was well padded and didn't have a scratch. But the top drawer handle was hanging by one screw. That screw hole was stretched out. I had to find another tiny black screw that was a bit longer in order to make the handle stay. (The nice people at our local Fastenal dealer helped me out.)The design of this is perfect-the top stores my most used jewelry. The first few drawers have lots of compartments. And the larger drawers were perfect for scarves, belts, and wallets and coin purses. It matches my 2 side tables from Target.It seemed a bit expensive for just oak veneer. But the design and practicality of the piece make it a value. <end>  Great armoire and great price  This is a beautiful armoire. It arrived in 2 days and it was in great condition. It was easy to deal with assembling the lid and it is a very heavy piece of furniture. I had read the other reviews before deciding to purchase it, so I was a little worried that there would be problems when it arrived, but I had no problems with it. It has lots of storage room and it is very attractive. I searched around for a better price, but this price was by far the lowest. It is a great deal and well worth the money. <end>  Mission-style with excellent quality and value  This jewelry armoire is well-designed for its purpose and it looks great with other mission-style furniture. It is very nice that is pre-assembled except for the top lid, which is easily attached with 5 included screws. It is a great value and excellent quality. Highly recommended. <end>  I LOVE THIS ARMOIRE  I LOVE all the drawers and all the space in this jewelry armoire.. It holds all of my jewelry and sooo many rings..It came very fast and it blends with my oak funriture very well, a little darker than what I have but it looks nice..My ONLY complaint is the hinges on the doors dont stay shut all the way.. It closes but not all the way.. but where I have it ,it doesnt show anyway so it is not a big dealHave no fear to purchase this.. It is awesome <end>  Not well made  Item arrived extremely damaged in several places. Not packaged well had to send it back. Very disappointed with the quality. <end>  Cheap.  I recieved the armoire in seven days. Very fast. But, I could tell there was going to be a problem, because the box was smashed in and I could see the armoire before I even opened it. It took my boyfriend and I to open it. When opened, the back top of the armoire had been previoulsly damaged. It had glue on it. The left side of the door had broken off, and there were many scratched on it. Very disappointed. Sent it back. I did order the Wilmington Cherry and Burl because the shipper has high ratings. AtHomeMart. <end>  matches wife's bedroom set  This piece was a Christmas gift for my wife. It matches the bedroom set perfectly. She really likes it, BUT also noticed a few flaws.Along with a few small rough unstained spots in the finish the magnetic locks on the side panels don't work.I have yet to contacted Powell about this . The locks i can get at the hardware store and my wife said she'll touch up the stainNo need to send it back <end>  Armoire  The Mission Oak Jewelry Armoire is a very pretty piece of furniture. The color is a little different than I was expecting; it has more red in it than the picture suggest. The drawers are on wood rails, so they do not glide very easily and the doors on the side do not open with a fluid motion that I was expecting for the price. The Cabinet and drawers are made of press wood, so be careful when handling. <end>  Great way to organize your jewelry  The amoire arrived within days and it was very little assembly. It is a beautiful piece of furniture that has a place for every piece of jewelry. Now, I do not have the junked up jewelry boxes! I can see every ring, necklace, bracelet and pin. I love it and I don't know why I waited so long to get one! <end>
 B000KFUC8K  Powell Masterpiece Antique Gold Jewelry Armoire ||	  Beautiful Jewelry Armoire  This jewelry armoire is well made and has very nice detail. The draws, top, and sides are lined. This armoire is sturdy, the base sits nicely and you don't need to worry about the piece tipping, very solid. I am very happy with the detailing. <end>
 B000KFUCWQ  Masterpiece "Antique Parchment" Hand Painted Jewelry Armoire ||	  Very pleased  I am very happy with this piece. It is sturdy and looks great in my bedroom, and makes a nice contrast with my cherry furniture. I received the armoire in just 1 day, it was packed very well. I was a little nervous about ordering it without actually seeing it. So happy that I can keep everything in one place, and the bottom drawers are great for scarves etc. <end>  Jewelry Armoire  Powell Masterpiece Aged White Jewelry Armoire; is absolutely gorgeous. It is distressed wood and hand painted with an antique look. It has the look of art an added benefit. The inside has a dark brown velvet. There is a good hiding fake drawer at the bottom. I bought it and it was delivered five days later, no three days wait. (thank you Amazon).It was simple to put together. All the screws were included and the instructions included. Powell comes from here but is assembled in China.I highly recommend this beautiful furniture to organize your jewelry.. <end>  Love it!  I am so glad that I bought this jewelry armoire. Not only is it beautiful, but it holds all of my jewelry in one place. It has shallow drawers for earrings and smaller accessories and deep drawers for chunky bracelets and beads, too. Very nicely made and sturdy. I highly recommend it! <end>  GORGEOUS JEWELRY ARMOIRE  This Jewelry Armoire is absolutely GORGEOUS! It is even more beautiful than the picture. It has amazing detail & superb workmanship. Amazon's packaging and 3-day delivery was outstanding. And the price was more than competitive. What a PERFECT purchase! Thank you Amazon!!! <end>
 B000KGASS8  Sterling Silver Marcasite Filigree Purse Locket / Prayer Box ||	  cute, but impractical  If you want to put anything in this locket (and who doesn't buy a locket for that purpose?) you'll have to use silver thread to tie it shut or solder it shut because it easily flies open. The purse "clasp" does not work like a regular purse's clasp whatsoever. Cute design though <end>
 B000KGKMSY  PalmBeach Jewelry Sweater Guard ||	  sweater guard  I was pleased with the design of the sweater guard , and my daughter was delighted when she got it as a stocking stuffer. Furthermore,my two granddaughters were very happy with each getting one of the free magnetic bracelets in their stockings!!My daughter had requested the guard, and it was nice to Google it and find one I liked.Thanks to Amazon and Palm Beach supplier. <end>  classic look  what can i say but I LOVE THIS! i only wish they had more products like it! it is so much better in person, it arrived quickly too. <end>  Beautiful clips, but....  This sweater guard has beautiful clips, but one clip is already beginning to weaken and fall off when I use it. It's also way over-priced. The free magnetic bracelet is a joke (so ugly). Also the chain is way too long for this to be used as a sweater guard. What I am planning to do is to shorten the chin and replace the clips which are only glued to the outer attractive clips so that I am able to continue using it. It's a beautiful piece, but disappointing for the amount of money I spent for it. <end>  Nice design  I love the sweater guard design, the silver color works with a lot of sweaters colors, its a shame that it doesn't work on blouses too. <end>  chain  very nice, chain is a bit long, would like it shorter very preetu, nice accessory for dressing up & going out <end>  Cheap  The clasp is cheap looking and doesn't work well. It just wouldn't stay on the sweater material, it kept slipping off. This is not worth the money! <end>  Perfect Cardigan Clip  I have a few cardigans that do not have buttons or any way to keep them closed. I have used cloak pins, but those sometimes come loose, and I've lost a couple. This works perfectly. The chain is a bit long for the purpose I had in mind. I thought I was going to need to have the chain shortened. I was very pleased to see that the jaw on the clip is deep enough that I can wrap the chain around it therefore shortening it, but leaving it long in case I want to use it that way. And as others have mentioned, it is pretty and seems well made. I'll try and upload a photo of it shortened. <end>  It is Marcasite  This item, which I found by researching, didn't actually describe what the latches were made of. I was pleasantly surprised becuase it is Marcasite, which is one of my favorite settings. I think I made a good choice choosing this item and the merchant has excellent service. It was what the ad said and shipped in a timely manner. I am well pleased. Thank you Amazon and third party! <end>  Hey- Good looking  This clip was beautiful. The "freebies" that came along with it looked cheap (perhaps that is why they were sent to me for free) but the product I paid for was exactly what I needed. They could keep those freebies since I considered them junk. Maybe I'll regift those items... <end>
 B000KGOVU4  PalmBeach Jewelry Round Simulated Pearl Goldtone Metal Enamel-Finish Flower Button Earrings ||	  Not what is pictured  I ordered this and was greatly disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!! What I got in no way resembled what is pictured here. I was also disappointed by how freaking huge they were. I have never woren them as my ears are not big enough, looking for an elephant with pierced ears to give them to!!! <end>  Pretty but easily broken!  I was so excited to get these earrings. I ordered them Sunday and they arrived Wednesday, so I was impressed with the speedy delivery. However, when I opened up the package, the back post that goes into the ear was badly bent. I went to fix one of them (not using a lot of pressure or force at all) and the whole inside part of the rose came completely off and would not go back in. Thinking I would try to superglue it back together I turn to the next earring. I pick it up, and the middle pearl falls off!!! I was so disappointed. I tried bending and supergluing last night with not much luck. They are very pretty and I hope I can get them fixed. They look exactly like the picture, just don't breathe on them or they will fall apart!!! <end>
 B000KGOW58  Men&apos;s Emerald-Cut Genuine Onyx Crystal Accent 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Classic Ring ||	  Amazed  I am honestly astonished that this ring looked even better in person than it does on the site for such a low price! I ordered this as an anniversary gift for my boyfriend and I really think he'll love it. It came beautifully polised and the crystals (or CZ's, not sure which they really are) look so much more real than the picture above makes them look. From a female's point of view I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this ring for your significant other. I'll update once I give it to my boyfriend with his reaction...Also, this seller was wonderful and got my item to me within just a few days, much quicker than expected! <end>  Extremely Disappointed  I bought this as a Valentine gift for my bf&it came in time but after wearing it for a party, when he took it off, his finger was literally green. I would absolutely not recommend to anyone. <end>  Great gift for that special man in your life  This ring is sure to please any man, I decided to pick it up for my special man and indeed it was a heart stopper however he's afraid to wear it and ruin it. The ring came just as the picture shows a beautiful gold tone with onyx and cz stones that look amazingly like diamonds. <end>  Purchased as a gift  My wife got this for me. She wanted to buy something expensive but we couldn't afford it. When I opened the box and saw this I couldn't believe my eyes. It looks way more expensive than what it really is. <end>  nice ring  ring was nicer than i though it would be,size of the ring was perfectand the style of the ring was perfect <end>  late delievery  i canceled my order of this product because the company palm jewerly took to long to shipped the product, two weeks had passed and it was processing.crystal <end>
 B000KGOXJI  PalmBeach Jewelry 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Curb-Link Adjustable Necklace 18&quot; to 21&quot; ||	  BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE  I was worried at about ordering this necklace without being able to see it first but I was pleasantly surprised when I recieved it. It is exactly what I wanted. It doesn't look fake or flimsy and is of very good quality. I also recieced a pretty bracelet as a free gift with my order. Would definitely order from this seller again! <end>  Very Classy  When I received this necklace I was so impressed. Everything about it is just perfect and it's of excellent quality. It is a 18" inch, Open-Link style necklace; the links are 5/8" width, which I would say is a medium-sized link. The clasp on this necklace is a fold-over clasp that just makes it such a quality piece. In person it's just gorgeous and I look forward to wearing it. I just love it! <end>  Love.  I love my new PalmBeach gold necklace ! It's exactly what I was looking for !PalmBeach sent me a free gift , very pleased. <end>  Gorgeous!  This necklace is an eyeball-dazzler--lays nicely on the neck, is a perfect length, & the links aren't too big/too small. I'm tickled with my purchase--looks gorgeous on! And shipping wuz included, making for a very reasonable price for a classic gold chain necklace.I also received a free bonus--a bracelet that's gold,silver,& copper but so far it's too small for my wrist. <end>  Cute necklace  I like the necklace, will definitely wear. The gold is a a little bit of a tacky gold color but it works. It also came along with a free cute silver bracelet which I wasn't expecting, and was a nice surprise! Overall, a pretty good purchase. <end>  Not Worth the $$$  This is a beautiful necklace if you plan to wear it only once or twice because that's how may wears i got out of it, and now it's completely tarnished. The metal is pretty much brown now. Not a happy customer. <end>  A little rapperish  i think its cute if you want to be rapper other than that it is a nice piece to have for thise strapless dresses so 50/50 on this piece <end>

 B000KKO65K  Double Star Drop Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Shining Stars  These earrings arrived very quickly after ordered and are beautiful. I bought them for my daughter, but might just have to buy a second pair for myself! <end>  Great earrings!  I was completely satisfied with my order. I just love the double star drop earrings! <end>  Not so great.  The stars are too big for my taste and look a bit tacky and gaudy. There is also a sauter mark on one of the upper stars that makes them look kinda cheap. <end>
 B000KL4B1S  Handcuff Stainless Steel necklace that Functions by Inox ||	  Much Larger Than Expected  This is more for a costume - way too big to wear as jewelry. <end>  Hand cuff jewelry  I loved the strength of the necklace. I ordered the earrings to match, and get nothing but compliments when I where the set ( or individually ). I love the fact that they are made out of Steel, as it doesn't tarnish, or stain the neck black like cheap silverwould. <end>

 B000KM54NQ  18K 7.5" Triple Strand Satin & Turquoise Bead Bracelet ||	  hard to find turquoise and gold bracelet  I had to surf the web to find a turquoise and gold bracelet and was happy to find the one I bought from Netaya. It is really a lovely bracelet and exactly what I was looking for. <end>

It was delivered as promised and the quality was very good. Very happy with this purchase. The only critisism is the chain. It would have been nice if the chain was a little thicker. <end>

 B000KN4WAQ  Amazon.com  Silver Loving Family Necklace 2 Parents, 1 CHILD  Clothing ||	  I love it!!  I received this necklace for my birthday early in March and have worn it daily since then! It's beauitful! I've seen others, but they have been large and 'clunky'. Mine has 2 adults and 3 kids and it's still dainty and beautiful!Couldn't be happier!=-) <end>
 B000KNCKP0  Sterling Silver Black Leather 24" Cord Chain Necklace ||	  Bad Recomendation  This necklace was suggested to buy with my Thor's hammer pendant from silver insanity. The problem is that it doesn't fit with the charm! The leather fell apart as I tried to fit it through. Try a 24 inch stainless steel chain instead. <end>  FALL-APART RIPPOFF  CLASP IS GLUED TO LEATHER AND PULLED APPART WHEN TRYING TO RELEASE THE CLASP. CLASP IS AFIXED TO LEATHE BY 1/4 INCH. NO RESPONCE FROM COMPANY, NO REPLACEMENT , NO REFUND. IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. FORGET THE CLASP (NOT SILVER) ORDER LARGER SIZE AND TIE A KNOT IN IT !!! <end>  Black cord chain  This particular chain is long enough to put over my head without opening the clasp. I love it. Looks good with all pendants and with tailored or dressy clothes. Thanks for making it available! <end>  Great quality for the price  Needed somthing simple for a charm I purchased for my wife and this was it. Well made <end>  poor quality  My order arrived quickly but upon FIRST use, the clasp broke on this necklace. Since it wasn't an expensive item, I joined the ends together with a small wire ring I already owned, since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item. As they say, "you get what you pay for!" <end>  Nice chain, but silver clasp was broken  Overall, this is a very nice leather chord necklace. Unfortunately, the silver clasp of the one I ordered was broken when I opened the package - that's why I gave it only three starts. Otherwise, I would have given it five stars. <end>  Concerned about clasp  This is a decent leather necklace, my only concern is that the clasp looks a bit delicate. Might not hold up while on stage "Rockin Out" !!!...Clasp is on the small side for male hands, but then, that's what "Lady Friends" are for !!! <end>  necklace  It's a great necklace! I already had a pendant to put on it and it works really well. The price is so reasonable. Other similar necklaces cost three times as much money. <end>  Two thumbs up!  I'm quite happy with this cord. It is sturdy and strong and perfect for my larger pendants. <end>  Its a leather cord...  It held the necklace I bought for it but was kind of short...would recomend this to a guy who likes necklaces. <end>  it is perfect  It compliments the Silver Vampire Ankh just beautifully. I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Comfortable, durable, attractive, perfect for a pendant  I purchased a very nice filigree pendant with energy protecting qualities. This fits perfectly and looks lovely - feels durable. Attractive and stylish. Nice silver clasp. More comfortable than my silver snake chain. <end>  Love it!  I purchased this necklace for my teenage niece for a stocking stuffer. She is going to love it. The picture does not do it justice, the seller has fast shipping. I will definitely purchase from this seller again. <end>
 B000KNJQF2  Tiny Sterling Silver Pig Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Pig Ears  My mother collects pigs, so I bought these for her as a joke. They were so inexpensive, I couldn't resist. She actually wears them! Though she is closing in on 60, she still has a sense of humor. She has her ears double pierced, and she wears these in her second hole. I would have thought to recommend these for younger girls, but apparently they work for "senior citizens" too. <end>  not my favorite  they are smaller than i had thought they would be and the ears make them not really look like pigs, but I probably should have seen that before ordering <end>  Perfectly cute!  I bought these studs to wear for everyday and I also got them as an inside joke. My PB (dog) loves to lick my ears and has a habit of getting the backs lost. These earrings may be small, but they have a nice sturdy post and backing to them. I've found that I really like them, no strike that, I love them! <end>
 B000KP1MIO  Sterling Silver 30" Inch Byzantine 3mm Chain Necklace ||	  really pretty  This is a nice interesting silver chain! Good for wearing alone or with a big pendant. The way the links work tho, it can sometimes get in the way of the bale of some pendants - a pendant with a simple thick round ring for a bale would work best with this one. The closure is well constructed and the chain itself appears to be very sturdy, and also not prone to hair pulling. <end>
 B000KP3NQI  6mm Sterling Silver 8" Cable or Rolo Link Chain Charm Bracelet ||	  silver bracelet  I bought this bracelet twice for my husband, i really like it. The only down is the rings to keep it togheter arent so strong, so he lost the 1st one. But like i said it's really a great product with a good price, so i bought it again, just half inch bigger. <end>  love it  I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction. <end>  Very nice  Very nice product that works well as the charm bracelet I bought it to be. <end>
 B000KP5NKM  Sterling Silver Dark Brown Leather 24" Cord Chain Necklace ||	  not nearly as dark brown as in the photo  I like this necklace cord OK, but it is not as dark a brown as in the photo (where it looks almost black). instead it's a medium brown color. the difference in color gives it more of a casual, Western/cowboy type of look. also, the title of the item clearly states "dark brown leather cord" and I thought it was real leather until I just noticed the descriptive paragraph lists it as "faux leather." this is a difference in quality that should be addressed in the title. <end>
 B000KPDYS0  Sardelli - 14k Cubic Zirconia Cross Post Earrings ||	  14K Cubic Zirconia Cross post earrings  These are beautiful earrings.They sparkle brilliantly.I love them. <end>
 B000KPG05O  Sardelli - 14k Oval Garnet Dangle Earrings ||	  Stunning  Very high quality gems. Can't believe I paid so little. Great for every day or dress up. Fast ship, too. <end>  Happy wife!  I honestly don't know a good garnet or setting to save my life, but I showed these to lady's in my office and they squeeled and said I "done good". Same response from my wife...she wears them as often as she can...she's very happy. <end>  Really Lovely Earrings  These earrings are truly beautiful. The garnets are a lovely color, and I wear them almost every day. If you like garnets, or just pretty things with an old fashioned feel, these are a lovely purchase, and well worth the price. They have a look of real quality. Also, the backs click on and are very secure. And comfortable to wear. I highly recommend these. <end>
 B000KPGSJM  14k Gold 4mm Synthetic Pink Tourmaline (Oct) Screwback Earrings ||	  earrings  The tourmaline earrings appeared to be of good quality and style and had screw-on backs for security. My girl friend liked them. <end>
 B000KPN35E  Sterling Silver Byzantine Bracelet - 7.5" ||	  Don't buy  Unfortunately, this was a gift and I cannot return it. It is nothing but cheap junk, definitely not sterling silver. Like another reviewer said, it is more like painted plastic. Save your money and time. <end>  Terrible quality  The photograph (and price) of this item would suggest it is of good quality. I was surprised and very disappointed to receive what seemed to be nothing more than plastic covered in silver-colored substance. DEFINITELY not sterling silver! Very cheap; over-priced. I would go so far as to say they have misrepresented the item and are ripping people off. I have returned the item and really resent having to pay return shipping! <end>  Bracelet Construction  This bracelet is undoubtedly Italian "Sterling Silver".The Italians prepare this with a base metal coated with sterling silver. By our standards this is not Sterling Silver. The ad is misleading and dishonest. <end>  Good choice  I am pleased w/this item and how quickly it arrived.However I needed a smaller size and called the company to see if they had it smaller.They did not.Decided to keep it anyway.I would recommend this item. <end>  Beautiful bracelet, very elegant!  My husband gave this to me as an early Valentine's Day present. It is gorgeous! I love the look, pictures do not do this justice! It looks elegant, and I can't wait to show it off. Great buy too! <end>  My best choice  I first thought about buying the product, but when it arraive by mail. OMG!! it was a Christmast gift but when i saw it, i wanted one for myself! It beutiful. It was more than what i had i mind.Thank you for the high quality product NETAYA. <end>  Nice find!  Nice, substantial, and a good value. Some reviews state that the clasp is too large, but I found that it compliments the bracelet nicely, seeing that it is not what you would call a petite piece of jewelry. Nice statement piece. <end>  Sterling Silver Bracelet  I wanted a sterling silver bracelet and thought this would be fine considering I have small wrists. But it still seemed small and I needed my husbands help to get it on. The color was also not what I expected; it looked too white. I have decided not to purchase jewelry online anymore. I want to see what I buy in person. <end>  Good purchase  The item arrived shortly after purchase, great condition, what you see is what you get. <end>  Byzantine bracelet  This bracelet is gorgeous, I just love it--so easy to wear, the clasp is strong and not likely to come apart. The weight and size are perfect. Actually the bracelet is prettier than the picture. After the bracelet arrived from Amazon, I purchased two more for birthday gifts. <end>  Love my bracelet  I'd been looking for a silver bracelet for quite some time. I love this bracelet! Great look. Wears well. Have it on today!! <end>  Love this bracelet  I just love this bracelet. I just saw the same bracelet for twice what we paid for it. <end>  Beautiful  The bracelet is even prettier than the picture was. I'm sure my sister will love it. The price was very reasonable and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Great gift. <end>  love the bracelet..  love,love,love this bracelet. this bracelet is fluid and flexible, very rich looking. i haven't taken it off since i received it in the mail and it looks as good as the day i got it. beautiful and bold. makes a statement. i would highly recommend this bracelet. <end>  A great piece of jewelry!  I love the Sterling Silver 7.5" Byzantine Bracelet. I've been looking for one for a while and the price on this one was just perfect. It is certainly shiny and attractive, but not bulky. Very light and well made. And the packaging was wonderful, it made me feel like I was getting an expensive present. Buy it! <end>  LOVEEEEEEE IT  THis product is so awsome, it is light but I was aware of this before I bought it and it;'s sterline silver. I just love it. And it's came in great timing, shiney and in a nice black velvet coated box. <end>  BEAUTIFUL AND VERY PLEASED!  I JUST GOT THIS BRACELET TODAY AND I LOVE IT! JUST BOLD ENOUGH, CAN WEAR IT EVERYDAY OR OUT. OVERALL, A GREAT SILVER BRACELET IF YOU DON'T OWN ONE ALREADY. GREAT BUY! IT ALSO LOOKS BETTER IN PERSON! <end>  Excellent fit and a very nice product  I really like the fit and feel of the bracelet and I always received compliment whenever I wear it. <end>  Intricate and Beautiful  My Girl friend just loved the bracelet. She was looking for something unique and different and then I saw this on Amazon and got it as the New Year's gift. She loves it. <end>  Large Byzantine Bracelet  I love this even though it was larger in width than I expected. I wear it everyday, though I do take it off at night and when I bathe. It was sent in a timely manner and with great service. If you love large silver you will love it. <end>  Too light to be solid silver?  Purchased this as a present, and will return it if we can. It feels generally flimsy and extremely light--as if it were silver-plated plastic rather than solid silver. I suppose there's no way to be sure without destroying it. In any event, it feels "cheap" and I would caution you to go elsewhere if you're looking for a nicer-quality gift item. <end>  Gorgeous Bracelet!  It's even prettier in person! It is just so classy and beautiful! Can be worn with a business suit or out on the town. Overall, great find!! LOVE it! <end>  This is NOT sterling silver  I just received this and I am EXTREMELY disappointed. This is NOT sterling silver. It's something painted silver. It is simply too light to be silver. On the clasp I can see that it is painted. Do not be fooled by the positive reviews. This is cheap looking and most likely a gross misrepresentation to say it is sterling silver. <end>  Disappointed  I received this bracelet last week to give as a gift to my sister for her birthday and was very disappointed. In person it looks like plastic and it is very light. The quality would be fair if your intention is to purchase a piece of costume jewelry that looks like truly cheap costume jewelry. It is not worth the price. <end>  Very disappointing!!!!  I always purchased on Amazon and always got great products.. but this time was different (unfortunately). I bought this bracelet based on the reviews and when I got it I was so disappointed  it look really cheap material. It is bulky which I liked but the material sucks... now i have to find another bracelet for my birthday! <end>  Sweet and Silver  The bracelet came soon after I ordered it, and was in perfect condition.I love the bracelet, it is well made, and looks exactly as described. The only thing I didn't like is the clasp, it's too large, even tho the bracelet is large, I think a different clasp would have looked better.The sender also made it convenient to return the item (if I had so desired) by including all the necessary items/instructions.I would highly recommend this company to all. <end>  to light weight  looks like a nice heavy piece but when it arrived it seemed light weight and cheep. I will return ( <end>  Too light, seems to be plated only, Not worth it! Feels and looks CHEAP!  When handle the size and volume of the jewelry is grossly out of proportion to its weight, its too light.Its probably plated with silver, it feels like a toy, and very cheap.Its marked as 925 Sterling silver, but its just too light its either all hollow or just plated plastic.This grossly being miss-represented. <end>  Pretty but check size.  Design of the braclet was nice, very light weight the size was too small. I suggest you try one size up to what you normally purchase. I returned and debated if to re order but choose not to. <end>  Great Look !!!!!!!  I bought this bracelet and I love it. I have small wrists and the fit is good.I would buy this again, in fact I am probably going to get a few for gifts. <end>  Beautiful Sterling Silver Bracelet!  I bought this bracelet as a gift for my sister-in-law's birthday. When I laid eyes on it, it was so beautiful I wanted to keep it for myself. Both my daughter's aged 13 and 10 wanted it and so did my niece, and she is only 5! My sister-in-law loved it, and who wouldn't. The intricate Byzantine design on the bracelet makes it exquisite. The silver color makes it look rich and expensive. The overall look is classy, not cheap. Even the clasp looks good when it shows. I thought it was a perfect gift. Something you can wear easily with a pair of jeans or a beautiful evening dress. <end>  I wouldn't buy this  My advise for other shoppers is that you should keep looking and not purchase this bracelet. If it really is sterling as it was advertised, I would be surprised. It is very cheap looking and feeling and I was very disappointed in it. I wanted to give zero stars, but the system required at least one star to reflect that a rating was given. <end>  Birthday Gift for a DIVA  What do you gift someone who has everything? This is elegant and delicate at the same time. She loved it and I'm happy that i made the purchase. <end>  This is a beautiful piece of jewelry  Bright and shiny, wrapped around a pillow and in a velvet bag...very, very nice presentation and very well made. It is an extremely beautiful piece of jewelry. <end>  Very cute & eye catching  Not too heavy and adds a nice touch. It's eye catching and I get many compliments on it. I wear it with my watch on the same wrist & they look fabulous together. I wear them almost every day. It is one of my favorites & I am very glad I purchased it. <end>  pleased  I normally wear gold but when I saw this bracelet I liked it so I thought why not silver, then it arrived and I thought awesome. <end>  Not a good description  Although this bracelet is beautiful it is, in fact, hollow and not as wide as the picture looks. Certainly, I guess we can calculate mm into in but even then...Should you hit it against something it will flatten out the weave. From what I now gather most of this style are hollow strands of silver weaved together. I am returning this today as I really wanted a solid roped chain and a bit thicker. <end>  Loved the sterling silver Byzantine bracelets  I purchased two of the sterling silver Byzantine bracelets to celebrate my daughter's 30th birthday. I gave her one and I wear the other hoping every time she looks at it and vice versa we'll think of one another. They are lovely to look at and I found the quality very high. I was very pleased! Thank you! <end>  Beautiful Bracelet. Love it.  This is gorgeous and good quality. The big clasp is attractive and easy to open, close, and hook. I love it. Everyone should buy one! <end>  very pretty braclet  The x-mas gift arrived ahead of schedule and was more beautiful than the online photos indicated. Very unique gift that is not available in jewlery stores in our area. Highly recommend! <end>  SS Byzantine Bracelet  I love this bracelet! I purchased it on sale thru Amazon.com for $45 plus free shipping plus a $25 coupon. What a bargain! I have received so many compliments on this bracelet. Some have stated that they don't like the large clasp--I do! The large clasp makes this bracelet different and much more easier to handle to put it on by myself. Overall, just love this bracelet and of course, love Amazon.com for the great bargains! <end>  Beautiful Bracelet  I bought this as a gift for a family member, and almost kept it for myself! It was very pretty. The clasp is large, but it's also a lot easier to get on that way! <end>  Beautiful Bracelet!  I bought this bracelet as a gift for somebody and when it arrived, it was so gorgeous that I thought of keeping it for myself. I went ahead and gave it away but am thinking of ordering one to keep. Great buy for the money -) <end>  Sent it back  When I received this item I was immediately disappointed. The bracelet is low quality and the spring clasp was defective. I returned it the same day. I'll return to QVC for great jewlery. <end>  When Sterling Silver is not Silver  This product is not sterling silver as advertised. It appeared to be some sort of plastic sprayed to be silver. I took the product to two jewellers to ascertain the nature of the material. They could not determine on simple examination the nature of the material. However, both confirmed my suspicions that the material was not sterling silver. <end>  So So Byzantine  Bracelet is exactly as pictured, however, the clasp does appear larger than necessary in person. The clasp is difficult to open and latch. Also, the bracelet's light weight makes it feel inexpensive and definitely not worth $50. The finish was more muted than I was hoping. It wasn't shiny, nor was it brushed. It looked dull.It is lovely chain pattern, and it arrived in a nice blue suede drawstring bag with the bracelet "hugging" a matching blue suede pillow inside the bag. It would have made a nice gift if the bracelet hadn't felt cheap. I ended up returning it. <end>  Good stuff  This product is a little bulkier than what it looks like on the pictures. It still looks great and it seems to be well built. It came in a real fancy box. <end>  Love it!!  I purchased this bracelet as a gift to myself. I love it! I have had it for over a year now and it still looks great and is my go to bracelet for casual or dressy occasions. It is sturdy with a strong clasp. The clasp is large, but goes well with the style of bracelet. My expectations have been and still are completely met. <end>  Magnificent Bracelet  This beautiful bracelet arrived, packaged like a treasure. And a treasure it is. At 10 mm thick and 7 1/2 inches long, I suppose it might be either a women's or men's bracelet. I'm not sure what length that men wear their bracelets at. The Byzantine linkage is intricate and fascinating. This chunky bracelet goes well with theCarolyn Pollack Sterling Silver Multi-Gemstone Bouquet Cuff Bracelet.It is high grade silver, untarnished, and polished to a high degree of shine, so that it is very bright. The only thing that I have a problem with is that it comes with a C closure, and so far the closure is quite stiff. When it loosens up, hopefully it will loosen up, it would be easier on old fingers to open and close them a lobster clasp. At least I think that this would be the case, because the tab that you manipulate on the C is much bigger than what you would get on a lobster clasp.At the price, I think this is a real steal. It is chunky enough to wear by itself, but it does do well with other bracelets. And it matches up well with theSterling Silver Italian Round BOX Necklace Chain 4mm (1/8 in.) Medium Heavy weight Smooth Finish Nickel Free, size 16 inch long. <end>  Not silver! Do not purchase!  I bought this and after a few months of wear, I decided to clean it. It's not silver...not even silver plated. The silver paint stripped off and now I have a tacky copper bracelet I paid $50 on...worst part is, I can't return it due to it being past 30 days. <end>  Nice for the Price  I liked the bracelet and wear it often. It was easier than some of my others to put on and take off. The quality on the clasp is a bit rough, but you get what you pay for. <end>  beautiful, heavy but not too chunky (update)  I got this for myself with money from a gift. It is larger that I expected, and the clasp is quite large too. But they are not too large and I am a petite woman. The clasp seems defective and won't open and close easily; I contacted the company and they are sending a new one (and I'm returning this one). Hopefully, the clasp will work properly and I can enjoy wearing this without worrying about it breaking or falling off. I saw a similar bracelet at a dept store, over twice the price on sale (but the clasp was better). Overall, nice piece!ETA  the item was replaced, and I bought another for my sister, no problems with the clasps on these two! I have gotten compliments wearing this. <end>  Lovely, chunky silver bracelet  This is a lovely, chunky silver bracelet, with a wonderfully large clasp that is nice to look at and easy to use. This bracelet has presence  it is not thin and dainty. It makes a bold, bright statement. It is not heavy, because of the open links, but also is not too light. It's got a great balance of delicacy (from the attractive weave and light color) and substance. I own one (a great gift from my husband that I picked out myself) and I gave one to a firend to celebrate her promotion. She was thrilled (maybe primarily by the promotion, but I think the bracelet was appreciated too.) <end>  Great Byzantine Bracelet  This was a really nice bracelet for the price---I paid almost twice as much for one elsewhere and it is almost identical except this one is wider and has a better weight to it---I would highly recomend this bracelet. <end>  Bracelet  The bracelet was very nice. I liked the style and it was of fair quality. The only thing I did not like about this bracelet was it's clasp. It was not as high of quality as the bracelet itself. <end>  Bought as a gift, but kept for myself  I bought this as a gift last year around Christmas, but loved it so much, I kept it for myself! I love bracelets and this is a very nice one for the price. I have had it now for a year and it has kept its lovely shine without tarnishing. It is much prettier in person than the picture can reflect! <end>  I LOVE IT!!!  This bracelet is fabulous. Looks great! It is well worth the money. I would consider buying another one for a Christmas gift. <end>
 B000KPOSQC  Rembrandt Charms 7-8" Charm Bracelet ||	  clasp issues  The clasp on this charm bracelet held well, too well. When I tryed to open it the back of the clasp fell off. <end>
 B000KPP5LE  Sterling Silver Round Amethyst Drop Earrings - 6mm ||	  Sweet but plain  This pair of earrings are sweet but plain. The stone is thin. What you see is what you get. <end>
 B000KPPGFY  Sterling Silver Polished & Satin Heart Bracelet 17" ||	  Sterling Silver Necklace--top quality!  Product as decribed! Lovely!Fast service and well packaged.Very satisfied with transaction. <end>  Beautiful necklace  I bought this for my 19 year old daughter and I know she'll love it. It is very well made, smooth against the skin and easy to wear. I bought it on sale so that made this pretty necklace an even better deal! <end>  Pretty but lightweight  Very pretty necklace but short and lightweight. More for an older child or teenager than for an adult. <end>  Netaya necklace  It was a nice necklace. Well made. It was a bit too short for me. It is very shiny. I did return the necklace because it was a bit too small. I had my refund in 3 weeks. Nice company. I would buy from them again. <end>  HappyShopper  It's a very beautiful necklace. The shipment was super fast! My friends guess its value from $50-70 ) I even can see 925Italy on it. Very happy with this buy. <end>  Cheapest necklace ever  This sterling sliver heart necklace was by far the cheapest item I have ever received from Amazon. The retailer quoted the original price as $150. Impossible!! It was not even worth the $23 I paid for it. It would even be considered cheap if won at a fair. I immediately returned it and would advise anyone else to not purchase this product because quite frankly, there is not one positive comment to make...extremely poor quality and ugly design. Enough said. <end>
 B000KPPGVS  14K Oval Cameo Pendant - 7/8" x 5/8" Depicting Mother Holding Child ||	  Simply Precious  I bought this piece to celebrate my daughter and I. I am so glad I did. It is very precious. I was concerned that it might be too small, but it is the perfect size. Also the detail in the carving is lovely. It will make a wonderful gift to any mother. <end>
 B000KPPIKW  Sterling Silver Close Interlink Necklace 16" ||	  Good product.  This item I would buy again, shipping on the other hand, you better order it with time to spare. <end>
 B000KPRKTE  Sterling Silver Oxidized Beaded Hoop Earrings ||	  Not what I expected..  I like these earrings, but for the price, I expected the posts to be sturdier than they are.The posts are very easy to bend, and I have to be extremely careful when inserting them, and attaching the butterfly clasp. The clasps are very tight on the posts, making it easy for me to accidentally bend the posts. If that happens too often, the post will snap right off the earring.In any case, the earrings themselves are pretty, but I wish I had known about the flimsy posts before purchasing. <end>
 B000KPRKVC  Sterling Silver Small Tortoise Shel Hoop Earrings ||	  Nicely made and very versitile  This are very nice earrings and go with lots of my clothes. They are well crafted and look nice on my ears. Perfect size for me. <end>  A great purchase.  These are especially nice. Not too heavy, just the right size, and really quite elegant. They look great with either brown or black. Taupe, camel, other browntones would be enhanced with these earrings. <end>
 B000KPTKZQ  Bling Jewelry Good Luck Four Leaf Clover Pendant Necklace 925 Silver 16 inches ||	  Very, Very Pretty!  I just got this shipped to me this week. I've gotten several compliments on it. I absolutely love it!!! It's a very simple, pretty, traditional design and the chain is the perfect thickness and length. I definately recommend this one! <end>  Good luck charm  Four Leaf Clover Pendant by Bling Jewelry is very pretty and authentic looking. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for this style. <end>  OK product  This is a great necklace and comes in nice packaging, perfect for gifts. The downfall is that the necklace chain came to me in knots that I haven't been able to completely undo. <end>
 B000KPVHIE  Sterling Silver Vintage Filigree Flower Pendant ||	  Very soft and feminine  This is a very cute and feminine necklace. I get a lot of compliments and it can be worn as an everyday necklace whether you are dressed up or not. I love this necklace. Very good quality as well. Real silver, doesn't turn colors. <end>
 B000KPX9ZS  Sterling Silver Triple Circle Link Chain Necklace with Extender 16+2in ||	  Sparklly but very light weight  The necklace arrived and is as pictured. I must say, I expected it to be a little heavier or more substantial, but for this price, it is lovely. Having the extender makes it work well with many different necklines. I'd give it four stars. <end>
 B000KPXM4Q  Calliope's Small Ancient Greek Sterling Silver Coin Necklace ||	  Beautiful, but mislabled  This is a wonderful little necklace, and I intend to wear it despite the fact that it is misnamed. This image has nothing to do with Calliope or the Muses. It depicts Hercules (or Alexander the Great dressed as Hercules) in the god's signature lion-skin. You can see the lion's head instead of hair on the figure, complete with ear, mane and teeth. The back of the coin depicts Zeus seated on his throne with staff and tiny eagle, and has part of the word "Alexandrou" in Greek at the side. <end>  Nice item, but some hassle  The item is very nice and I agree with the prior reviewer that it is not an image of a muse, but one of Hercules. Once ordered the seller called and said that it was unavailable and offered a larger replacement at the same cost. A decent thing to do, but we were not interested in the replacement. We asked for a refund, but before that happened, the coin necklace became available and was delivered. Surprise! In any case it was worth the money and I would buy it again. <end>  Good but could be better  i like this necklace, it looks really nice, but isn't what the name say, i think its Hercules like everybody think <end>  Unhappy  I ordered a Calliope Muse necklace and got a tiny MAN. Most likely Hercules. Well, yes, we all love Herc, but I wanted Calliope. I should have looked more closely at the picture and the reviews. It's far more hassle to return it and hunt down a new one than it is to just keep it and pass it along as a gift. If it were labeled correctly? GREAT gift. But useless to me now, other than a gift. <end>
 B000KPXN04  Sterling Silver Fleur de Lis Pendant ||	  Sterling Silver Fleur de Lis is a perfect gift!  I got this for my GF and she loves it very much tho get the long chain as the one i got was a little short. Very good qualaty and nice finnish! <end>  Very nice, worth the price.  I love this necklace. I had one like it before but lost it. I'm so glad I could find it again! <end>
 B000KPXNL8  Question Mark Necklace ||	  Question Mark Neckess is questionable  We returned the neckless because we felt that the question mark was much smaller than the picture indicated. The company was good about accepting its return and provided refund in a timely manner. <end>
 B000KRIEDI  Sterling Silver Necklace / Bracelet with a Moon Slide ||	  Sterling silver bracelet with moon slide.  If infants could wear jewelry, this would be appropriate. It is so tiny you almost have to use a magnifier to see it. Veru close to invisible. <end>
 B000KTO2E6  Beach Wood Coconut Shell and Swirl Inlay Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Very nice, but a bit pricey  I wanted earrings to go with my brown outfits. This works and is very beautiful for a piece of jewelry. What you see is what you get, which doesn't always happen. The only complaint is it was higher priced (with shipping) than I would have liked. <end>  These are great earrings D  When I saw these earrings I knew that they were perfect for my sister. They are so amazing, but the only problem with them is that when I got them they don't much look like the photo. They look handmade but still they are beautiful. <end>
 B000KTS3L4  Moon Shaped Natural Beach Wood Coconut Shell and Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  coconut shell moon earrings  These were cheaply priced and cheaply made. One of the coconut moons fell off the earring hook as I removed it from the shipping container. I've tried to put it back together for wearing, but the one time I did wear it, the moon fell off again within an hour of putting them on. They are pretty, but probably not worth the price. <end>
 B000KU7H38  Sterling Silver 16" Polished Swirls Necklace - 16" ||	  love silver  This necklace is beautiful! I really loved the way it looked. The only problem is that it always rolled. It never stayed flat around my neck. Very annoying. What a shame, I did return it. I had the same problem with another necklace. <end>
 B000KU9I7Q  Sterling Silver 8 Rows Solid Bismarck Bracelet 7.5" ||	  Poorlly made but pretty.  I purchased this bracelet with the matching necklace. The necklace clasp arrived broken, and as the bracelet had the same type of clasp, I sent both of them back. Pretty, though. <end>  Poor quality  This product looks cheap like it came out of a bubble gum machine. I've found better items at this price at TJ Msxx(no shipping charges). I truly love a bargain and thought I was getting a deal on this item. I would not recommend this item. The item did arrive quick. <end>  Silver Bracelet  This bracelet is beautiful and well worth the price. It arrived quickly after my order was placed and I'm very happy with the quality. Thank you! <end>  Very Well Made and beautiful  Very well made and beautiful. reasonable shipping charges. Just as advertised. Exceeded expectations. <end>  beautiful  It is a beautiful bracelet and I gets lots of compliments on it.Very happy with this purchase.thank you <end>

 B000KW5CIS  Ss .050 Diamond Cut Rope 20in-it ||	  Tremendous.  This chain is pretty. The shine is just perfect, the size is not ridiculously huge or too small, very subtle. It surprised me how well it looked once it came. The packaging was outstanding, every precaution was taken to ensure it wouldn't get damaged in transit. I'm very pleased. <end>  Nice Chain  I love this chain and wear it all the time. It seems to be well made. <end>

 B000L1CO1G  Princess Diana Inspired - Sterling Silver Deep Blue Sapphire CZ Ring - 9 ||	  Deep Blue Sapphire CZ Ring  Deep Blue Sapphire CZ Ring  This is an attractive sterling silver ring with a beautiful deep blue large stone in the middle, surrounded by clear cut small stones. <end>  Recommendation  This ring arrived very, very quickly. It was covered in a pretty, yellow silk pouch and looks exactly like it does in the picture, very beautiful. <end>  INCREDABLE RING.  i had purchased a copy in england after charles and diana were married. the ring i bought from amazon.comis much better. better quality, and the colour of the stone is perfect,all the surrounding diamonds also look real. very brilliant, wear this and i promise you will be noticed. the stone is around 4 carats maybe a little more,this fact should have been mentioned in the description. i love this ring and will not do the dishes with it on. i think i will buy the dodi ring he was going to give diana before they both died.there is a listing through amazon.com <end>  LIKE PRINCESS DIANA'S ENGAGEMENT RING, ONLY BETTER!  My favorite ring of all time is Princess Diana's blue sapphire and diamond engagement ring. Over the years I've gotten various knock-off versions of the ring. This one comes the closest to looking like that ring, only a more modernized look with the cubic zirconias lined down each side of the ring. It is very comfortable on my finger because of the wider sides supporting the zircons. The cubic zirconias are bright and shiny, which sometimes lends to a fake appearance in its sparkliness. The color of the sapphire is the same royal blue of Princess Diana's ring; I have her actual engagement pictures taken by Lord Snowdon in an old book which prominently shows her ring. For the price, this is quite a lovely ring to own. <end>  Wonderful  Never had such quick shipping in all my life.Plus the ring is very very sparkly and catches everyone's attention! Love it <end>  Looks Great!!  The stone is big and bright..just how it looks in the picture...infact the picture could have been better.I really like it and it always seems to draw attention.Also the shipping is very quick. <end>  Beautiful Ring  This is a beautiful ring, and I am pleased with this purchase. The blue color catches the eye, and it reminds me of the Heart of the Ocean necklace from the movie, "Titanic". Soon after the "Titanic" mania, when I attended a Celine Dion concert, I bought a small Heart of the Ocean necklace as a souvenir from the concert. Anyways, this ring is substantial, and I think it's perfect timing now to give this ring as a gift with the recent Kate Middleton & Prince William royal engagement. Kate Middleton is a classy beautiful lady just as Princess Diana was. I had a good male friend in my undergraduate college days, and he said that his ideal woman was a classy lady like Princess Diana. I've always had a lot of respect for Princess Diana. Princess Diana was a beautiful, kind, generous, compassionate, classy humanitarian and this ring brings positive feelings and reminds me of all the good works that Princess Diana contributed to this Earth. I still remember the sad time when Princess Diana died, and watching the coverage for hours at my first boyfriend's home. Not a lot of us have the money or fortune to have the actual "Princess Diana/ Kate Middleton ring", but this replica ring makes a decent reasonably priced gift for those who are fans of classy jewelry, classy women like Princess Diana and Kate Middleton, royalty, or romance. <end>  Should have been checked by seller before sending  This was a very pretty ring but a few of the stones are loose. I feel that it should have been checked by the seller before sending it out. <end>  Beautiful ring - just as pictured!  This ring came quickly and looks just as it does in the picture - beautiful! The sapphire is a little darker than I had hoped it would be, but that just makes it look even more like it could be real. The stone is quite large, making it a great cocktail ring, but a little too much for everyday wear. Will definitely enjoy wearing for holiday parties and special occasions. <end>  princess Diana want to be  I love this ring it is pretty, wasn't as big as I was afraid it would be, perfect size. I wear it all the time. <end>  very pretty ring  I got this ring to match Peora sapphire earring and pendant set. It is very pretty (just like the picture or even better) and has a lot of sparkle to it. The sapphire stone also looks great. I would definitely recommend it. <end>  Princess Ring for my Princess  My daughter graduated from college so as a gift, I bought this beautiful ring for her. She loved it and so do I!! <end>  Beautiful Ring  Bought this as a gift for my sister. Am sure she will love it as she was a big fan of Princess Diana. <end>  Don't buy it  If I had seen this ring in a store, there is no way I would have paid $50 for it. It looks as if it is worth about $19, if that. It does not appear real in any aspect and when I contacted the seller regarding the late delivery, I received no response.It arrived in a cheap white taped box.I am not going to bother to return it but I doubt I will wear it very much. Do not buy this ring. <end>  Pretty but wear with caution  O.K. this is my second try doing the review for this item. When I bought this item in November the cost was only $9.99. It says Sterling Silver (I wear sterling silver jewelry all the time so I thought nothing of it) and began to wear it the day I got the ring in it's little white box. I took it off when I got home-before washing dishes, sleeping, showering etc. then wore it the following day to work. It turned my finger green after wearing it for only 4 hours. Someone told me to put clear nailpolish on it but why should I have to do that if it's genuine sterling silver like all my other rings that don't turn my finger green? It's pretty, thats for sure but I can't wear it too long due to the green factor. I wouldn't pay more than the $15 bucks (shipping and handling along with the price tag) I ended up paying for it. <end>  Misleading!  The seller needs to include the dimensions of the ring. Because it's tilted you cannot tell what the size of the ring-- there must be different views. <end>
 B000L3OAUC  Genuine Pink Rhodonite, Peridot, and Amethyst Sterling Silver Gemstone Pendant ||	  Love this item!  I was more than pleased when I received this pendant! It has a nice feel and you actually know it's there, instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away. You have to look extremely close to see the peridot in the setting, but that is all I have to complain about! Definitely worth your money. <end>  Disappointed with Color  I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. MY STONE IS NOT BLUE AND BRIGHT PINK AS PICTURED, BUT MORE LIKE BLACK AND ROSE-COLORED PINK. I WISH I HADN'T ACCIDENTALLY THROWN OUT THE PACKAGING, OR I WOULD RETURN IT. THAT SAID, IT CAME QUICKLY AND WAS PACKAGED NICELY. <end>  pink rhodonite, peridot and amethyst pendant  I know it said it would probably differ slightly from the picture, but the color seems more on the flat side to me. The main stones cut also seems a little sloppy(but I am a perfectionst!) Either way, it's not bad for the price... and I will still be giving it as a gift along with a few other things. Mabey it doesnt seem so great because I ordered the teardrop moonstone pendant along with it and THAT is really nice! <end>
 B000L4VE8M  14k Yellow Drop Heart Lever-Back Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  BEAUTIFUL  I BOUGHT A PAIR OF THESE IN THE CARRIBEAN 11 YEARS AGO AND GOT NOTHING BUT COMPLIMENTS ON THEM, ($25-) I LOST ONE OF THE EARING AND HAD TO REPLACE THEM. I SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW AND EVEN CALLED THE ISLAND JEWELRY STORE WHERE I BOUGHT THEM AND NO ONE HAD THEM. OF COURSE GOLD WENT THROUGHT THE ROOP IN THE MEANTIME, BUT I FINALLY FOUND THEM ON AMAZON AND REPLACED THEM AND TURNED THE ORINGINAL SINGLE ON INTO A CHARM. STILL GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME, LOVE THEM! <end>  Good value for the money  I ordered these a a gift for my mom. She loved them. She has worn them a lot and the levers are still in great working order. Sometimes those wear out quickly on less expensive earrings. I am pleased with the bargain. <end>
 B000L4VJ82  14k Yellow 6 mm Round Orange Created Coral Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Reminds me of my favorite Manc  These earrings are great for 2 reasons 1.they are perfectly round2.they are orangeTherefore, they remind me of one of my most favorite people in the world, Karl Pilkington. Congrats for creating jewelry so like Karl's head. <end>
 B000L4XJKI  14k Yellow Red and Green CZ Childrens Screw-Back Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Cute, but poor design results in breakage  I bought two sets of these earrings, one pair for each of my daughters. The earrings were so pretty and they were excited to wear them. Unfortunately, one earring from each set broke by the second day. The frame that the gems sit in is much too flimsy. The leaf broke away from the flower! Mind you my daughters are ballet dancers and do not play soccer or other rough sports. I cannot blame the breakage on anything other than a weak design. Do not buy these earrings, you will waste your money. <end>  Very pretty and well-made  This is a very cute pair of earrings for a child. Customer service was great. I received these close to Christmas and a stone fell out right away because it wasn't set well. (The stones are tiny.) They immediately sent out a new pair so I was able to give them as a Christmas gift. <end>  childrens screw back earrings  I was so happy when I saw these pair of earrings on amazon shopping list & my daughter just got her ears pierce, so I could have it as a Christmas give for her. Turn out the purple pink colors is not colors at all & it is just all white crystal around it. I was very disappoint. <end>
 B000L4ZDLQ  14k White 6 mm Round CZ Friction-Back Post Stud Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  So far so good...  I bought these earrings with the idea of leaving them in all the time. So far, they're holding up well and look good, but I've only had them for a couple of weeks! The posts are quite thin and bend pretty easily, and the setting is also quite thin. They seem a bit fragile. The stones are fairly sparkly, but they're a bit too big for my taste (one would never mistake them for real diamonds!) Overall, not bad for the price. <end>
 B000L4ZJXI  14k Yellow 6 mm Round Dark-Red Created Coral Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Beyond a Bargain  More than I expected, absolutely beautiful. Expensive looking. Accessorizes many colors.I hope the prices remain the same, I will order more. <end>
 B000L4ZOQA  Mystic Fire Topaz Cocktail Ring 14K Gold Ladies Oval ||	  Pretty ring!  This is a pretty ring but the color is not as green asI would have wanted and the prongs are not very tight. <end>  5.50 cttw Oval Cut Fire Topaz & Diamond on 14K Gold ring  The wife loved this ring and ours was just as pictured. We got free sizing with this ring. <end>
 B000L51454  14k White 10 mm Love-Knot Friction-Back Post Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Perfect! Beautiful gift!!  If you're looking for a great pair of earrings you've just found them! My husband bought these for me as a birthday gift (good job, honey!)and they are beautiful. If I had seen them in person I would have immediately put them on my Wish List; I couldn't have done better myself. Looking forward to many years of wearing them. These are somewhat large for a post earring, so if you prefer something smaller on your earlobe I wouldn't get these. <end>
 B000L5151M  Solid 14k Yellow July Birthstone 5mm Heart Created Ruby Screw-Back Stud Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Absolutely Adorable!  These earrings are absolutely adorable, and for the price, you can't go wrong! These are great for children, teenagers and anyone that loses their backs easily.The backs are a "screw on type" and they NEED to be twisted off. These will not just easily fall off the ear, which I love, and they are a very nice size. Not too big, but not little girl small where they won't be seen either. So, if you're looking for a special little girl, or for someone that loses backs easily, you don't have to look any further. These Screw-back earrings will be a wonderful addition to anyone's jewelry box.They are quality made and look beautiful on, I highly recommend these earrings to anyone! <end>  Seemed a bit small.  Only complaint, and this is my ability to measure, is they are small. Advertised as 5mm, and they are 5mm. It is just that 5mm is smaller than I had hoped. Had I gotten off my but and went to get a ruler, I would have known how big 5mm is. I needed more like 7mm, so that is my disappointment.However, they placated my wife for this Valentine's Day (one of the 60 some-odd days a year I have a knack for screwing up), and she said that next year I can get her the right sized ones and give these to our daughter. They even have the screw-on safety back thingies for little girls.So, win-win!Great price, shipping arrived with one day to spare! <end>  Nice look, description not quite right.  Sorry, not a screw back, as claimed. The stones are a nice color, so nice they look synthetic. But the color and shape hold up in the little size. They are as cute as they look in photo. But just can't rate it higher with the incorrect description. <end>  Very nice as a gift for babies or children  I bought this as a gift for a niece turning one. The size and type of fastener (screw, not pressure plate) were ideal for this particular setting. The gems look nice and the recipients were satisfied with the quality. I would say it was good value for the price. <end>  Great gift for a child  I bought these earrings for my 11 year old daughter and I am very pleased with them. They're the perfect size and I love that she can't get them off without me because of the screw backs. Which means there's no chance of her losing them. <end>

 B000L5T7O4  Cubed Amethyst Gemstone Bead Drops Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  how many shades of purple are there?  I really like the looks of these. The ring and the cube make a nice contrast and I would have given these a five star rating except for the color which is as dark a shade of purple as you will ever see. I really wanted this particular shade and I will probably give them away rather than send them back because postage is so high anymore. They are small, less than an inch, which will please some and disappoint others. But when you by a pair of earrings for it's specific color, it's no bargain if it's wrong. <end>  nice  they look nice on ears. the stones are a bit bigger than I imagined, but not oversized, so it's ok. <end>
 B000L5V404  Angel or Bird Wings Feather Antiqued Finish Brass-Tone Hook Earrings ||	  leaf/feather earrings  the picture makes these earrings look beautiful but in real life they are not quite so. the brass is very thin and it basically just has one green stripe down the middle of the earring... not very natural/pretty at all. seems as if someone rushed to color these. would be much better if the green was applied like in the picture. this is the second time i have bought from this seller. seems their jewelery is always less sturdy/appealing than seems in the description/picture <end>
 B000L5X4I4  Straight Stick Drops and Genuine Blue Lapis Bead Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Nice earrings  I like these earrings because they are simple and attractive. I needed some earrings that were blue and am very satisfied with these. They look great with the lapis necklace I bought from Amazon also. <end>  DISAPPOINTED  Sterling silver stick drops are flimsy and bent out of shape immediately. I know they were inexpensive, but really.... <end>  insubstantial construction  the hooks are reasonably sturdy, the beads are gorgeous, but the stick section is pitifully weak--sterling is way too soft a metal to depend on such a thin wire. The earrings came out of the bag bent in several places, and will likely get bent just by normal wear. I"m keeping them, because I ordered them to get my order over the $75.00 free shipping limit. Otherwise, back they'd go. <end>  Straight Stick Drops and Genuine Blur Lapis Bead Sterling Silver Hook Earrings  I love the earrings but the straight stick was a little bent when I received them, but I still wear them all the same. I love the style of these earrings! <end>

 B000L7ZQK6  Antiqued Sterling Silver US Navy Irish Celtic Knot Cross Pendant ||	  Great gift!!  I purchased this U.S.Navy Irish Celtic Cross as a Christmas gift for my 19 year old son. He says that it is his favorite Christmas gift and has been very proudly showing it to family and friends. He is in Naval Officer training and is very excited over the fact that the cross symbolizes his Irish heritage and Christian faith. Product is beautifully detailed and I am very pleased with the seller's customer service. Only drawback is that I wish it came with a chain included. Had to buy my own 24" silver chain. <end>
 B000L81UUA  St. Christopher Sterling Silver US Coast Guard Reveresible Pendant with 20 inch Steel Necklace Chain ||	  Terrible-if I could get it less than 1 star I would  The item was misrepresented.

Very adaptable to lots of outfits, delicate, perfect length, and love the leverbacks that prevent loss of earrings.

They are beautifully made light weight and add a touch of casual and classy, pretty enough to wear on casual Friday and to dress up with the french clasp is definitely a plus!!!! I will definitely order from GEM again!!! <end>  Pretty earrings, nice silver  These earrings are pretty. They are a nice, light weight- good for people who have recently had their ears pierced. The leverbacks work well. The only reason I did not give them five stars is that they are a little too dainty for me. I like more ethnic, chunky jewelry; this is a matter of personal preference, though. I would recommend them because they are well-made. <end>  Very Very Pretty  These earrings are now my new best favorite  ) They are just so awesome!! Shiny and the perfect size. So many wonderful words come to my mind when thinking of these. Thank you!!!!! <end>  oh so pretty and shiny!  They're very very pretty and shiny. Great size to wear all day long. Loved them.

She loved them, she hasn't taken them off since I gave them to her. <end>
 B000LB8UHS  Childs or Kids Catholic Rosary Beads Italian Made Sterling Silver Cross Bracelet 6" ||	  Very sweet  This rosary bracelet is very sweet and delicate...but not TOO delicate for my almost 4-year-old daughter. She loves it, and we let her wear it when we pray the rosary. <end>
 B000LB8UKU  Genuine Rainbow Moonstone Sun Shape Sterling Silver Gemstone Pendant ||	  lovely moonstone  I own many moonstone pendants but this one is by far the best of the group. The craftsmanship is excellent. I order nintyseven percent of my jewelry from Amazon and I have never been disappointed. Silver Insanity is one of my favorite sites on Amazon to purchase from. <end>  Rainbow Moonstone Sun-shaped Pendant  MAGICAL! It's a beautiful piece of jewelry. I should have ordered the chain to go with it. I'm extremely satisfied with my FIRST moonstone jewelry -- I want earrings and a ring to match! It's much bigger than I expected and very opalescent with rainbow tones. It feels Enchanting! Mystical! Magical! Just like the Orb in the Sky! <end>  The new price is too much!  I love this moonstone and have bought two...one for me and one for my sister. However, when I bought this for my sister it was $40 dollars and when I bought it for myself it was $60! This was in the span of a month that it increased by $20??? I can see if you sold it with the chain but there is no chain. Why the price increase??? I have bought moonstone pendants larger than this for $35 dollars. The price is ridiculous! It would be one thing if it was gold but it's silver. I am not pleased with the price of this and see no reason for the increase in price. It is a nice piece but not worth $60 dollars. <end>  NOT LIKE PICTURE  I ORDERED THE FIRST ONE AND THE STONE WAS UGLY; IT HAD NO RAINBOW. IT WAS ALL MILKY OPAGUE. SO I THOUGHT I JUST GOT A BAD ONE AND I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE, AND WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS JUST AS BAD AS THE FIRST, SO I SENT THEM BOTH BACK. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. MAYBE THEY CAN'T GET A DECENT STONE IN THAT SIZE. <end>  Beautiful!  This pendent could not be more beautiful. It was even nicer than I expected. The only thing I don't like is that the thing the chain goes through keeps turning upside down so that the pointy part is facing up. It seems like it's not balanced right, or something. I love it anyway and wear it all the time. <end>  LOVE THIS PENDANT!!!  My boyfriend got me this necklace for Christmas last year and I love it! I wear it almost everyday and it's still in great condition. The moonstone itself is gorgeous and I get compliments on it all the time. I'd definitely recommend buying this product. You won't be disappointed. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful  This pendent is beautiful. I didn't think it would be as glamorous as it looked in the picture but it truly is. No matter what you wear it goes with it nicely. In a one out of ten rating, its a ten tops. <end>  amazing piece for the price  This piece's high quality is belied by its low price tag! It has heft and solidity and at least my particular moonstone has the most gorgeous fractures and inclusions giving it a lovely depth and complexity. I've only owned it for three days and have gotten dozens of compliments. <end>  Beautiful.  This pendant is absolutely beautiful!! It is even more beautiful than on the picture. The blue flash of the moonstone is amazing. As for Silver insanity... wonderfull experience. Delivered in two days on regular shipping, way before estimated delivery time. <end>  Beautiful piece.  This is a very beautiful piece of jewelry. I like the colors in the stone and I like the setting very much. <end>

 B000LEMVBG  Contico PW1921 Work Box ||	  Quality has gone down - due to wheels.  I have two of these Contico tool box. The first one I had lasted a long time. It is light and cheap. Made out of plastic, so easy to haul around. The handle on the top is not really necessary. Because if ure toolbox is full and heavy, the handle will break off. Don't expect too much from this toolbox, as it is not rugged, but it sure beats carrying around a bucket or box w/o wheels.The new one I ordered from Amazon is the same box & handles. The color is reversed. Yellow for the base and black for the cover (as pictured). The old one, the colors were vice-sersa. The wheels are now some sucky wheel that does not fit well. It makes the tool box wobbly when rolling it around. I had to change it out with lawn mower wheels bought separately from Home Depot.Suggestion to manufacturer  change back to the original wheels on the older box. I think those wheels were cheaper than the new ones, but performed the way it should. <end>  Great product!  This was exactly what we were looking for and I hadn't been able to find it anywhere else! I have one of these boxes that I have been using for a while but the handle broke off. I was so glad to find another one. Thanks! <end>
 B000LF6738  White AA+ Cultured Pearl Bracelet w. Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Rose Clasp 7" (L1S2R2) ||	  Nice product... not so well made  I received this the other day in the mail and couldn't wait for my fiance to open it before I checked it out. The clasp looks very sturdy, looks easy to use and is so shinny it almost looks like diamonds. The pearls are great quality, slightly off circle with some blemishes but all in all they are nice and shine great... I'm sure my fiance will love it.*UPDATE*This item is poorly made and I would suggest you do not buy it. They used cheap string instead of a fishing line material that would hold better. As well, the clasp is almost laughable. My fiance was clapping the other day and the bracelet fell off every time. Go for a different brand. <end>
 B000LF89OS  EZ Match AAAA Cultured Pearl Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Stud Earrings Set (LS1B) ||	  Perfect set of colors  I really like these earrings. They are the perfect size since I prefer smaller earrings and the colors are a perfect mix. I can find a pair to match anything I wear. <end>  Mismatched color  Got mine by yesterday, the peach pair looks mismatched because one of the studs is much faint than the other one; it looks more like cream other than peach. The other pair of pearl earrings I ordered from the same seller has a quite visible flaw on one of the pearls. The previous purchases I did with this company were very pleased, and they do have very good products. My review will be update when my problems solved.----------11 29 p.m Oct 24, 20108 31 p.m Oct 25 update  Got the reply from the seller this morning, and we are in process of exchange now. <end>  Perfect pearl studs  Each pair of earrings are well-matched, the lustre is good, and the colors are very nice. I bought these for my second holes and they are perfect. I am very pleased with the earrings. <end>  all four at this price-grab them while they last  I love all the pearl earrings that I've gotten from Dahlia that I had to order these as a gift. They are slightly larger than the size you find in stores and are a great gift for any lady who likes to keep it classic but change up the colors. I might order another set for myself. <end>  Glad I Bought Them!  These earrings are small, but they are beautiful. I have worn the white pair repeatedly, the others occasionally, since their purchase many months ago. The white ones have held up well, maintaining their luster, and look new. I've really enjoyed them. <end>  cultured pearl earrings  These earrings were the perfect Christmas gift for my daughter. She is very pleased with them. The delivery service for this item was on time and the communication from the seller was excellent. I would buy from the seller again. <end>
 B000LHM168  OM or Aum Hindu Yoga Symbol Sterling Silver Round Hook Earrings ||	  Great little statement  Om is an ancient symbol of peace and harmony, and wearing these lovely earrings gives me a feeling of sharing my spirituality with the universe. They are light in weight but substantial enough, with the depth of the design. <end>  Fantastic earrings  I love the earrings. They are perfect. additionally, the seller sent them extremely quickly. Well packaged. Wonderful seller. <end>
 B000LLS1Y0  EXP Handmade Carnelian Agate & Silver Necklace ||	  Gorgeous!  I LOVE this beautiful necklace. I bought it for a friend for Christmas, and was tempted to keep it for myself. The weight is good and the length is just right. <end>  Not quite what you might expect.  The overall impressions of other reviewers seemed to be that the quality of this product was better than the cost would indicate. I have to disagree. The silver beads are of a similar or lower quality than those found in any old bead shop. The ruby beads are very milky and have little character. The feel in the hand is stiff and cheap. Overall, it feels like a $5 piece of junk store jewelry. <end>  Beautiful  I own this necklace, it is beautiful. The color is wonderful, sometimes a cherry red and sometimes a raspberry red. It is an impressive necklace which never fails to get compliments. Order it , I don't think you'll be sorry. <end>  Stunning necklace  I can't say enough about how pretty this ruby bead necklace is. Beads are beautiful color, clean looking. Silver spacer beads are lovely too. I bought the earrings with this necklace - have just now purchased the matching bracelet. Will have a really lovely ensemble. <end>
 B000LQKSKA  14K White Gold Men's Wedding Wedding Band ||	  Great ring  This is a really nice ring. It has a nice shine to it. Feels comfortable when wearing. Different but not flashy, a break from the ordinary wedding band. <end>
 B000LQOHU2  Cherrywood Ring Box ||	  Exactly what I wanted  I read reviews all the time, I never buy anything unless someone can tell me something about it. So this point of view is from someone who really takes time to read reviews.I ordered the ring box on Oct. 1st and decided to go with fast shipping just in case... it arrived on Oct. 5th. So the package arrived in perfect condition and on time. They also tracked the package and I had to sign for it. Which that isn't necessarily important, but being that I needed the box before Oct. 7th, my mind was at ease knowing where the package was.Someone else wrote a review and said..."it's a box and does what it needs to". That's exactly it. It looks very similar to the picture except the inside is a little bit lighter. Good box, if you need a box.The End. <end>  Ring box is good  The box itself is good but the holding system for the ring is less than desired. It is too difficult to put the ring into the box. Also it looks like the holder will wear out quickly. <end>  Its Fine  The ox is just what its states the box will be...if you wanna be freakin WOWed than no but if you want an nice clean simple box then this is it. <end>  Very Nice  It is pretty nice, it looks and feels like there is leather inside, and the "wood" is decent. Only problem for me was that the slot for the ring is very skinny. It will only fit one ring, so if you plan on having the engagement ring and wedding ring in there it is pretty tricky. <end>  Cheap look and feel  It hasn't been easy finding a decent box for the ring I got for my fiance. Truth be told, this is slightly better than the three others I've ordered online recently only to throw them away as soon as I got them. This could have been so much better if someone had picked a better color and material for the hinge which is cheap looking and poorly installed. The wood finish was also poorly done with small areas missed during the varnish application. Great company to deal with, unfortunately not a great product considering the reason why the average customer would order this. <end>  This is better than the jewlers box  I have a 4 1/2 carat diamond and the box it came in does not compare to this one. BUY IT! <end>  Great deal!  I'm very happy with the jewelry box...When I ordered this item, I was going back and forth between another jewelry box and I definitely made the right choice. For those of you in the same predicament, here's my take  the item is not quite as dark as the picture looks but still quite a handsome piece. It is a deep, rich cherrywood with a definite red undertone. The box arrived a day ahead of schedule and in good condition. A great buy! <end>  Beautiful ring box  Beautiful ring box. I bought a ring off Amazon also, but it only came in a little cardboard box. This cherrywood ring box was a perfect way to present it. It arrived fast and exactly as pictured. I would recommend this product and seller to anyone. <end>  Decent quality ring box  I bought this box to replace one that I received from the jeweler. Seeing that I had spent so much for such a nice ring, I didn't want to ruin the presentation with a crappy box. This one is definitely much better quality and has a better appearance than the one that came with the ring. I only have two complaints about the box  1. The ring holder holds the ring in a vertical position. This is personal preference, but I think the ring would look better angled. 2. The wood is so heavily shellacked that it almost appears that it's not wood at all. Opening up the box and removing some of the padding reveals it is actual wood, but without checking it has the shine and weight of something made of plastic. Despite these two minor complaints, I'm quite happy with the purchase. <end>  An Amazing Ring Box  I purchased this ring box because I wanted something that looked really classy when I proposed. This box not only met my expectations, but it exceeded them. Quite honestly, there is nothing like a nice wood ring box to put your ring in. Thankfully, I am officially engaged and she continually tells me how much more she likes this box over the box the ring came in. Although the shipping was a bit on the expensive side, I highly recommend this box. I will likely purchase the other boxes for jewelry items in the future. <end>  Phenomenal  The box was exactly as pictured! Classic, doesn't look cheap or feel flimsy. The ring fits fine. I received it about a week after I ordered. <end>  An Absolute Steal  The workmanship for this product is exquisite; the material used, first rate. I love the way it looks right from the moment I opened the box and viewed the product. For the price I paid for it, I must say it was an absolute steal!! Thank you... RAUL <end>  Beautiful was perfect arrived in time for x-mass  I ordered this ring box 24 Nov 2009 it arrived 9 Dec in time for X Mass. The box was beautiful perfect for the custom made ring I bought in Italy. I was upset about the Amazon estimated shipping time it stated the gift woud arrive the 29th Dec to 13th Jan I coudn't believe that it would take that long. I wrote Samuals no reply yet but the box arrived today so the Amazon estimated shipping arival date was way off. I would buy again. <end>  Well, she said "yes".  I'm engaged. So clearly the box did its job. The ring fits in it. It opens. It closes. It looks nice. It feels nice. It's a box. What more could I ask of it? <end>  Not quite as dipicted.  Be warned, this product does not look quite the same as the picture might have you believe.You'll notice that the leather in the picture appears to be a subtle off-white while the real thing is a blinding pure white.Also, the interior is constructed somewhat differently than depicted.What is truly disappointing is the box itself.You'll notice that the box depicted appears to be a smooth brownish-red in color. In reality the color is vibrant red. I'm talking clown nose red. I'm talking call girl's lipstick red.The varnish or lacquer or whatever it is is applied so thickly there's no telling whether this is truly cherry wood or not.If the above described seems like something you'd like to purchase, know there are similar items sold here on Amazon for less.VERY DISAPOINTING. <end>  A very nice box  This is a very nice box not only was she thrilled with the ring that was in the box she admired the box as well before opening it. If your looking for something nicer then the standard velvet box look no further this will give that special ring for that special someone the presentation it deserves. <end>  Gorgeous!  What a perfect box... WAY better than you would get at any jewelry place! Some reviewers have said that the finish is so flawless that it doesnt even seem like real wood, but if you look underneath, you can see the edges of the real wood beneath the finish just to say, yep it's real! Flawless craftsmanship and quality of materials. Point being is that this thing is beautiful and I would definitely buy it again! <end>  Great Quality  Amazing Quality for this price. I fiancee loved it. Better quality that what you can find in a jewelry store. <end>  Great  The box is pretty great. The photo here is a bit misleading though, it's color is more of a red than it is a brown, but it still looks fantastic. The exterior is a bit shiny, but the faux wood looks great and not cheap in anyway. The interior is a faux leather, but again, looks great. The best thing though is that the ring is presented at a slight angle, so when you open it, you see all of the diamond face rather than the side. My fiancee loved it! A word to the wise though, the hinge on the box is pretty strong so when you go to close it, it will sharply snap shut. Just be careful not to get any eager fingers in there. <end>  Beautiful!  I ordered this on Tuesday and received in on Friday morning via USPS. The ring box itself was in another box to protect it, and in a bubble wrapped package. When I opened it, I couldn't believe I only paid $10 for it. It looks like a box from an extremely high end jewelers store. The inside of it is white leather. It's extremely sturdy and doesn't look cheap at all. My only complaint about this box is that when you set the ring in it, it stands straight up in down, not slanted towards the front of the box like most boxes do. But that still doesn't beat how beautiful, cheap and amazing it is! Wouldn't trade it for anything and yes, I recommend this product  ) <end>  Excellent little box  I bought this to hold an engagement ring. It's the ring my father gave my mother, years ago, and it's been waiting for me to find someone worth giving it to. So I wanted a solid, nice-looking box to go with it; something I would be proud to hand over to the person who will one day wear it. This box fits the bill. It's sturdy, so it will protect the contents, and it's pretty, so I won't be ashamed to hand it over. Thanks, folks, for making something so perfect for its job. <end>  beautiful box  I wouldn't say this little box made any difference in her answer to the big question but I wanted the day to be perfect down to the last detail and this little box did it's part. <end>  Has some scratch but nice home for my ring  The box itself is ok. Just have some small scratch on it. Inside is completely white. Anyway, It provides a good place for my ring and It looks beautiful. <end>  Good customer service  I received this product ahead of schedule but there was a minor defect with the box. However, the seller graciously offered to replace the box free of charge. The second one was in excellent condition. Really appreciated it!As for the box, it is quite shiny and glossy. If that's what you're looking for then this box is perfect. <end>  Beautiful Ring Box  I bought this box for an engagement ring. I didn't want to display the diamond in a box with a jewelery store logo inside the lid.It was shipped fast and I was very happy with the quality of this box. Its a deep brown/red with a high gloss finish. The inside is a very nice white leather or leatherette material. The box made a huge impression before it was even opened. Very pleased. <end>

I am very pleased with what I got and I don't know how much can be said about the ring itself. It is shiny and thin prefect for a females hands. I wouldn't put it on a man , a bit too Dainty, Go for the wider ones for a dude. <end>  Nice ring. Great price. iweddingband delivered on time for Christmas.  I made a last-minute decision to get this and ordered with expidited shiping. They promised delivery on December 24, and I recieved the ring on Dec. 23.My wife is a nurse and can't wear her diamond wedding ring to work, but likes to have a band. She lost the band I got her on our 1st Christmas when we moved to our new house. So, I was hoping that this ring would look nice.My wife was more than happy with the looks. It is simple but pretty, and we are very happy with the purchase. <end>  Well Pleased  I am well pleased with my ring. It was prompt and in good condition when I received. It actually looked like what I saw when I ordered. <end>  Ring  My husband is a banquet server, he has to move tables around constantly. This ring has held up through it all. No bending or mishaping. Some wear, but no more than usual. Comfortable fit, simple. <end>  Just Perfect  My engagement ring had a wide band so I needed a slim comfortable band to go with it. My husband found this one, it looks amazing with my engagment ring and without it! It is so comfortable! <end>  Pretty, but scratches easily  Beautiful plain wedding band that works well if you want something simple for everyday or for traveling. It is quite flat, so would work well if you are in a job where you work with your hands a lot. Because it is 10K gold, it scratches easily and doesn't stay as shiny as some of the higher karats, but still a nice ring. And well worth the price! <end>  Great Purchase  I bought this ring for a thumb ring. It's pretty and it's comfortable. It costs a little more than I'd hoped, but it was better priced than other offers that I saw. <end>
 B000M07FFG  Sterling Silver Dazzling Garnet Gemstone Ring Size 5.5 ,6,6.5,7,8.5,9 ||	  Gorgeous!  This ring is absolutely beautiful!! The only thing I found when I received it was that the garnets were not as deep red as I was expecting; these ones are a more pink colour...overall though, I am more than pleased with it, and my sister said that I should give it to her, despite being a December baby, lol... <end>  genuine garnet  For genuine garnet, this ring has an amazing price tag with such a beautiful design. The prongs are set so as not to catch in your hair or threading and such. The stone's color matches the advertised picture so - 'what you see is what you get.' <end>

This is a great, big ring that looks like something in a medieval fantasy movie! My daughter loves it! (So do I, so I'm going to have to borrow it now and then!) It definitely looks like something 3 or 4 times the price.The delivery was fast and it comes in a nice box, so don't hesitate if you like the look - it really IS a nice, solid, well-set ring! (I have a lot of very expensive jewelry and this ring would not look out of place with my collection!) <end>  Looks antique!  i love this ring! it looks antique...reminds me of Edwardian style jewelry a little. great buy! <end>  A ring worthy of royalty!

Fast delivery, and a real find at his price. <end>  really nice ring  i love this ring. it is very well made. i bought it a little to big, that's my only regret. i can still fit it but is slips. that's the only thing that keeps me from wearing it everyday. my only advice is to make sure you know your correct ring size, you'll want to wear this one! <end>  great quality  i have done quality assurance work for many years. now i am happily retired. but i am very particular about the quality of anything i buy. way too picky actually. i can't find anything to complain about in this ring. it is beautifully done. the ring is larger than i thought from the picture but that's a good thing. it looks great on my finger. i am very pleased with all my purchases from gem avenue. no one will think you paid so little for this ring either. <end>  Absolutely beautiful quality ring  My wife was so excited when she saw the ring...it truly is a quality ring.We will definitely look to purchase more jewelry from your site. <end>  A great ring that's inexspensive!  I love this ring because of it's size and boldness. I love chunky jewelry that doesn't look cheap. This ring is goth-light and not overbearing. I would love to see more rings like this one on amazon. <end>  fabulous  well i had a problem with the shipping but that was due to holiday mail.I contacted the sales people and they asked would i like reshipment or a refund,i said go head and reship it.Let me tell u i was in awe,and glad i did i luv silver been wearing it since age 12 i also luv differnt styles u dont c much and the bigger the better,the mother of pearl is shinny and the margesite is so stunning with it,the ring runs a bit big however my fingers swell now and again so im satified and very content,thanks,eve...ps well worth the wait <end>
 B000M631VW  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Oval Shaped 24mm x 10mm Simulated Coral Polished Finish 4mm Marcasite Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Coral Silver Ring  This is so so so so pretty.

Buy this, you won't be sorry. <end>  Very Nice  This product came nicely package and in a timily matter. Product is very nice and I will buy from them again. Nice piece of jewerly. <end>  Lovely stylish ring with rich color  I love this ring. It can be worn for dress or with casual clothing. The color is deep and the marcasite setting adds to its beauty. I have long slim fingers, and it is sized perfectly for my hand. Wearing it creates an elegant Victorian look. I have received numerous compliments on this elegant piece. <end>  Stunning Ring  I love this ring because it looks like the medival time ring, the size of the coral is perfect, and those marcasites around it. it just makes it look so pricey.I am very glad to own it. <end>  just loved it  It is so good that the people think it is real red coral. I am always wearing it and no discoloration after 6 months. Great buy. <end>
 B000M8IOBM  Solid Sterling Silver Red Crystal Heart Ring Please specify size  7 ||	  Pretty ring  I ordered this ring for my granddaughter, and when it arrived it was even prettier than I expected. She loved it. I would definitely order one like it again. <end>  Crystal heart ring  I was very pleased with this purchase. It was bought for my granddaughterand she loves anything glittery. I was pleased also that the ring was thickenough that she will not wear it our or it will not break because of wear. <end>
 B000M8Q996  Solid Sterling Silver Crown Ring Please specify size  7 ||	  The picture does NOT do it justice  I had been searching for a crown ring for a long time, and the one I had originally wanted to buy was unfortunately out of stock/unavailable. I continued searching for crown rings online, and came across this one. The picture makes it looks really small and "ugly" but when I got it in the mail, I was really surprised by how much I loved it. My fingers are not very long and I cannot wear big banded rings because it would be too much for my fingers. This ring was perfect for my fingers, I loved the silver quality, and the price was excellent. It costed two times less than the original ring I wanted to buy, and you would not believe how many compliments I have gotten for this ring.Just to recap  it's beautiful, good quality, perfect for small slender fingers, GREAT price, and VERY ORIGINAL. I assure you there will be a lot of compliments. =) <end>
 B000M8S3RM  Solid Sterling Silver Feather Light Ring Please specify size  9 ||	  feather ring  this ring is delicate, not gaudy. I liked it but then my grandaughter saw it and liked it too. So now it's hers. <end>
 B000M9254S  Made with Swarovski Elements Carnelian Crystal Sterling Silver French Ear Wire Hook 1.25" Long Dangle Earrings ||	  At last, a perfectly plain perfect red earring  About 20 years ago, I asked my husband for a pair of red earrings. I didn't know exactly what I wanted; I simply envisioned a plain red that would go with everything. So my husband bought me rubies. I appreciated his extravagance, but not the earrings! There were several more tries over the years, but they were never the solid red earrings I was looking for. But these are. The red is rich, the shape is geometric and simple, and they go with everything I want red earrings to go with! <end>
 B000M94YVK  Made with Swarovski Elements Black Onyx Crystal Sterling Silver French Wire 1.25" Long Dangle Earrings ||	  Black Onyx Earrings  My earrings arrived earlier than expected, which is great because I was going to be wearing them to a wedding with some other onyx jewlery. These earrings matched perfect with my black onyx ring and necklace. I got many compliments on the earrings at the wedding.Great price and as I have said before will definently buy again from this seller. <end>
 B000M958LA  Made with Swarovski Elements Oriental Blue Cats Eye Crystal Sterling Silver French Wire 1.25" Dangle Earrings ||	  Excellent product!  The picture don't do these little jewels justice! They are even better when you receive them! I got these for my niece for Christmas and she loved them. I'm thinking about ordering myself a pair. Cory <end>  Swarovski french hook earrings  these earrings are more beautiful "in person" than on the website. I thought I'd get myself something casual to wear w/jeans, but I feel like I should be wearing a gown with these earrings! Good quality. Good service. I will order from this vendor again.Julie M <end>
 B000M977QO  Made with Swarovski Elements Cats Eye Smokey TopazCrystal Sterling Silver French Wire 1.25" Long Dangle Earrings ||	  Nice everyday earing  These make a nice pair of every day earrings. They are attractive, and just the right length. I bought several in different colors. <end>
 B000M9MO4Y  Solid Sterling Silver "Jesus" Band Ring Please specify size  10 ||	  Sterling Silver Jesus Ring  I love my sterling silver JESUS ring. First-rate seller and products. Would highly recommend this seller! <end>  Nice Ring  I love this nice stirdy band. I wear it as a thumb ring. The name is nice & dark, I wash my hands a lot & it hasn't changed @ all. It is just cute. <end>
 B000M9N5LU  Titanium 10mm Flat Wedding Band Ring Polished Celtic Knot work on Matte Background Comfort-fit, sizes 7 to 14 ||	  Wedding ring  This is a great ring. I purchased it for my fiance's wedding ring. I know he will enjoy it. <end>  The ring is nice, but different from the picture  The ring I received is very nice, but it looks quite bit different from what is pictured. The ring on the picture looks carved on a polished background where the Celtic Knot is contiguous. The ring I received is laser etched with several independent Celtic Knots in groups of 4. So nice ring, but not as advertised. <end>  Awesome!  I live in California and this product took just 2 days to arrive! The picture does not do the ring justice and it looks even better in real life! <end>  best value  Bought this ring as a matching set a year and a half ago for my husband and I to wear as our everyday wedding band. They still look as good as they did when they arrived.( and my husband is a military man so his ring takes some abuse ) stop thinking about it and buy this is all i can say, you will NOT regret it! <end>  Gorgeous ring!  I bought this ring for my boyfriend for Christmas. I searched for about 4 hours looking at all the different celtic knot rings and this one caught my eye and rightfully so. It's so lightweight yet beautifully designed.The picture does not do it justice but does have the same look as the photo. I ordered this on Sunday and received it the following Tuesday. Needless to say it was very speedy and the price is absolutely worth it. I will definitely buy from this seller again. I could not be happier. <end>  Extremely fast shipping and a great price!  I recieved this in less than 2 days. Bought this for the fiance for his birthday, he's not use to wearing rings but i wanted to point out that this ring is pretty wide and thick, he'll just have to get use to it. Its a great product and an even great price! <end>  Could not be more pleased!  I ordered this ring early AM on Mar 3rd, it was in my mailbox in Ca. when I got home on the 4th. Looks just like the picture, fits like a dream and because its made of titanium even the size 14 I ordered to wear as a thumb ring weighs almost nothing. I truly could not be more pleased. Great job. Great ring. <end>  fantastic! I love this ring. This is the 2nd one I've owned (I had to go up a size recently, due to some unfortunatweight gain)  i've bought this ring from Sabrina Silver twice now, and BOTH times I have been MORE than satisfied with both the speed of receipt as well as the high quality of her products. I highly recommend the product and the seller! <end>  Celtic Knot  The order process was smooth. I received the ring in about a week. Although not the correct product. After a minor search I was able to find the return policy and returned the incorrect for the correct with no hitch. I received the correct ring about a week ago. I am very happy. I will in the future buy more gifts from Sabrina Silver. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This ring looks much more expensive, I'm very happy.(If you have big hands or long fingers, will look better, remember is a 10mm ring) <end>  If you like a lighweight ring.........  Titanium is very lightweight to wear and very strong.The pattern is beautiful. Nice wide band. Highly recommended. True to size. <end>  VERY HAPPY!!!!  I ordered from Sabrina Silver and could not be happier with the service that I recived. When I ordered two new wedding bands for my huband & I ( our fist anniversary), I ordered the wrong size. Sabrina told me to ship the ring back and they would exchange it and ship the new band for free. The rings were back to me within a week and a half. They get a FIVE STAR rating from, WYOMING. THANK YOU AGAIN, SABRINA The rings are wonderful... My husband was thrilled!! <end>
 B000M9NDS0  Solid Sterling Silver "What Would Jesus Do" Band Ring Please specify size  7 ||	  awesome ring!  I love this ring! It's the perfect size, and i've worn it contantly ever since i got it... definitely not planning to take it off anytime soon! <end>
 B000M9NDTY  Solid Sterling Silver Light Ring Please specify size  9 ||	  great!  Great ring, also own the "Truth", "Hope" and "Love" rings by the same company. Great look. Stays clean and polished, clean,looks lovely stacked with the others or just alone. So much fun to wear and play with. It's perfect to put in between all other rings. <end>  Great ring.  Bought this as a thumb ring and love it. Dirt cheap and doesn't look like it. Most cheap rings in the stores turn my fingers green, but this one was even cheaper and never gives me any problems. Would definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  Great Quality for a great price.  I don't normally write reviews but I found this ring to be exactly what I was looking for. I couldn't be happier. I was wary of the quality b/c it was so inexpensive but I have had absolutely no problems with the ring. I even wear the ring in the shower and it still looks great.Thanks so much! <end>  Simple and pretty  This ring is a nice simple silver band. Nice shiny polished finish. Very light. I would recomend stacking it with other silvermoon rings! <end>
 B000M9NDY4  Solid Sterling Silver Jesus Band Ring Please specify size  8 ||	  Very special ring with the name Jesus in block letters  I had had a similar ring that was a cherished gift from a friend and it was lost during a hospital stay. I had looked everywhere for a ring to replace it and was unable to find one. So I was thrilled to find this ring on Amazon.Com. The size was perfect and the ring is slender enough to be comfortable on my finger, yet the word stands out very clearly. I've seen some rings with Jesus' name on that are so thin that the name was just about unreadable. It also doesn't seem to tarnish the way my other ring did. I've seldom had to polish it. I'm very pleased with this ring and am going to order one for a friend's birthday as soon as I find out her ring size. She has mentioned how much she likes my ring. This ring is very nice and the price is reasonable. <end>
 B000M9OGWM  Solid Sterling Silver Amethyst Ring Please specify size  5 ||	  Nice ring!  Very nice ring. It does look a bit like the picture on the webpage. The amethyst is not shiny, but a dark purple. The silver ring is nice quality. However, I don't think all sizes are the same, I ordered 2 rings at size 5, and I do notice that they're different, one is looser than the other. <end>
 B000M9OHC6  Geometric shaped stones with pink, peridot, amethyst, yellow and Blue Topaz CZ Sterling Silver Ring Please specify size  8 ||	  Big, bold, beautiful  The stones seem to float on the highly polished surface. A nice assortment of colors that make this ring a go-with for any outfit. <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring is even more gorgous in person, I love it. I wear it all the time! <end>
 B000MC7JO6  Solid Sterling Silver Turquoise Ring Please specify size  9 ||	  poor service/poor quality  I contacted the vendor right after ordering and cancelled order. They shipped anyway and made it my problem to return item. Item had fault in the stone on top of not being wanted. poor quality and poor service. <end>

 B000MC99MQ  Solid Sterling Silver Clip-on Emerald Cut Emerald CZ & Princess Cut Clear CZ Earrings ||	  Pretty purchase  These earrings are a nice addition to my collection <end>
 B000MCGHJ4  Silver harp JEWELRY NECKLACE bracelet earrings HOLDER stand tree - Set of THREE Displays ||	  Just what I needed!  The seller of this product was quick to respond to my emails, and the shipping was super fast.The stands themselves are beautiful! Bigger than expected. The holes on the earring display are spaced just perfectly for studs or hoops. The bracelet display is a little awkward at first because you have to remove the entire bar to get one bracelet off, but much better than my alternative of a bowl.The necklace holder is a nice size with the hooks extending out far enough to hang more than one necklace.Overall a great buy, and much cheaper than a jewelry armoire! <end>  Jewelry Display Stands  This is a nice jewelry stand set, with an earring holder, bracelet holder, and necklace rack. I would say that the earring one is the best with the most practical use. The necklace holder presents the problem of not being able to really see the items hung on the backside. The bracelet holder is not as easy to use because instead of just hanging your jewelry, you have to remove the bars and slide bracelets on it and snap the bar back...more steps/work than I would like. <end>  Functional, stylish, and fabulous organizer!  I just received this set in the mail. I was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the product. The finish is a brushed silver, rather than polished, which goes with my aesthetic perfectly--not too shiny. I love the number of holes in the earring organizer, and it accommodates studs, hoops, french wires, and spring loaded claps equally well. I was even surprised when a pair of my grandmother's antique screw-ons stayed on tight.The bracelet organizer is perfect not just for bracelets, but also rings, and necklaces that have shape, such as rigid chokers. Finally, the necklace hanger can hold many dangling necklaces, even two on a hook as a previous reviewer noted. For longer necklaces that outstrip the height of the organizer, a simple extra loop does the trick. Overall, a great buy for $50. Quick shipping too! <end>  Great space saver  I had been looking for something to store some of my everyday jewelry in. I couldn't see spending a lot of money on a case, since I really don't have the room for one. I bought this set of three and love them. It fits all my earings, the bars hold the various bracelets and the necklace holder holds most of my necklaces. It sits on top of my dresser and friends have commented on what a clever way to store my jewelry. Perfect for the price! <end>  great gift  I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and she was very happy with it. It's far better than the other jewelry stands (the headless Barbie thingies) I saw in stores. <end>  Works great looks great  These pieces were bigger than I thought they would be. They work perfectly and look pretty sitting on my dresser. <end>  Love it!  The three piece jewelry stand is definitely worth the money. My jewlry is well organized and my dresser looks a lot neater. <end>  missing items  my order included 3 items, only one came and no clue where the other 2 are. i contancted amazon n they said the only option i have is to return and get my money back <end>  review  I bought all three of these and like the way they look very much. As other folks have said, it is a bit of a pain to have to undo the ends of the bracelet holder to get the bracelets off, but it is better than having them in a pile on the dresser. The jewelery holder is very good looking but does not hold quite as many pairs as advertised if you have some larger earrings. The necklace holder definitely did not hold as many as I had hoped. After I rearranged my necklaces it is better. <end>  Clear those drawers and see what you've got!  the Future Missus had a bit too much clutter jewelry-wise and needed to see where that peice she'd been looking for for a week was!These definitely helped.A must-have for bangle, necklace, and accessory ladies. <end>  large jewelry holder  Much bigger than I expected.... holds quite a bit of necklaces. So far I have only used the large necklace and the bracelet holder. I like them better than having my necklaces in container.Sometimes it is hard to remove the necklace/bracelet and others fall off.I have yet to try the earring holder.. <end>  Silver Jewelry Set of 3  This set is not only beautiful but practical. Each display can hold a lot of pieces and it looks beautiful on display. It is much easier in the morning to see all of my jewelry instead of digging through piles and wearing the same items over and over.The diplays are sturdy and the price is very reasonable. I highly recommend over the drawer organizers for your everyday jewelry. <end>
 B000MCLUAK  Necklace Jewelry Rack Holder Silver Table Top Stand Display ||	  Cute and it Works  This holds your necklaces and lets them be part of the decor. It's simple to get the necklaces on and off. <end>  Very Nice  This is a very nice way to display your jewelry. It looks very nice and is also pleasing to look at. The weight is good. Would recommend. <end>  Necklace Holder  I bought this on Thursday and received it on Saturday. I just opened the package today (Monday) and when I touched the necklace holder my fingers turned silver. I think that the seller just sprayed it with a silver color once I placed the order and didn't even give it some time to let the color dry. This can definitely ruin my necklaces and transfer color to my jewelry. I won't recommend to other people to buy it. I think that I will purchase a more expensive necklace holder to get a better quality! <end>  Love this!  I was so tired of digging thru a pile of jewelry! I feel so organized and my necklaces are easy to see and I can pick what I want quickly. <end>  works great as a lantern holder  i recently bought a candle lantern and didn't have any place to put it. i was going to buy chain and a ceiling hook but living in a rental apartment, i didn't want to make gaping holes in the wall and i couldn't find adhesive strip hooks that curved all the way around to hang things from the ceiling with. so naturally, i started looking for lantern holders and they were so expensive! and then i started looking at hanging plant holders which were a bit cheaper but but they all looked so boring and ugly. i happened to also be looking for glass jewelry containers and when i came across this cross-sell, i knew it would be perfect to hang a lantern on! it looks great and is sturdy enough to hang a light candle lantern from. i found it to be a wonderful, cheaper alternative and now it looks great on my desk! <end>  A bit Fiddly  It was easy at first but then you over fill it and they all get tangled! I don't know if I just have a lot of necklaces of if its not just me! <end>  Great Product  Works really well for all my necklaces and bracelets. Pay attention to the product dimensions. The picture makes it seem smaller than it is. <end>  great jewelry holder  great design, larger than expected.. could have gotten one size smaller, but holds everything perfectly! <end>  Great way to get organized!  I love this... it looks great on my dresser and helps so that I can see all my necklaces at once! <end>  Love it!  Works perfectly to store my necklaces and bracelets! I can fit quite a bit on here, yet it still fits well on my small bathroom sink. <end>  Exactly what I needed  This necklace holder is perfect for my necklaces. It is very tall, so even my longer necklaces fit on it. It looks great on my shelf and I couldn't be happier. <end>  Great product.  I hate the old fashioned jewelry boxes and needed something for my necklaces. This holder is perfect. It looks nice on my dresser and keeps all my necklaces from getting tangled together. It holds about 20 necklaces, even longer ones. It's attractive and very functional. I highly recommend this product. <end>  Great organizer  I have been searching for a necklace holder and this is the perfect one! It has a very pretty shape and is able to hold pretty much all of my necklaces. I love this rack and am very pleased with my purchase. It arrived in great condition and was shipped right after I purchased it.I would certainly suggest this product to anyone looking to better organize their necklaces! <end>  very nice  I bought this for my mom for xmas and one for myself. Both of us were very pleased with it. It's very affordable. It's plain and simple yet elegant because it resembles a harp once you've got necklaces hanging on it. It's sturdy and has plenty of room for many necklaces. <end>  great product  great! It holds a lot more than it looks, and it was everything I needed! Each hook will actually hold 1-5 necklaces, and the bigger ones hang on the side, so convenient! <end>  Love it!  This necklace holder has worked out so well! It's a perfect size, it's very sturdy, and you can hang necklaces on the front and on the back so it balances very well. The shape is beautiful and very pleasing to look at. Very pretty! <end>  Great Product and Great Value!  I love this product! Very useful in jewelry clutter management. As other reviewers have noted, this product is HUGE! It made me realize that I need to buy more necklaces. Jewelry organizers can be very pricey, I've seen much less functional racks at two or three times this price. I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product to anyone. I also purchased the other organizers in the series, theBLACK JEWELRY harp BRACELET RACK stand HOLDER gift NEWandSILVER JEWELRY harp Earring RACK stand HOLDERand am pleased with those as well. <end>  Great Holder  This is actually the second one I bought. It is easy to see and organize all of the necklaces I have bought over the years. <end>  neclace stand  Ours had no flaws in workmanship and seems sturdy. It does not hold longer neclaces but they can just be double looped. <end>
 B000MFD9P6  Sterling Silver Simulated Diamond Dragonfly Pendant, 18" ||	  Very nice and sturdy  For the price, this is a very nice piece of jewelry. It has a sturdy feel and is very sparkly. <end>  Remarkably sparkly  This pendant is a deal. It sparkles beautifully and the dragonfly shape is lovely. I wear it often with casual clothes. <end>  Beautiful  I love this necklace. I purchased it for my granddaughter and she loves it too. Quality for a low price. I will purchase again from this retailer. Nice job <end>  Very pritty  I bought this for my sister, and she loved it. Its very detailed and shiny. Very unique if one loves dragonflies. <end>  Very pretty and feminine.  Nice quality for the price, looks very pretty and feminine with a collared shirt. I would give this as a gift, too. <end>  Dragonfly pendant - beauty!  I purchased this necklace as a lightning deal after Thanksgiving in the hope that it would be as pretty as it looked. It was a very well received Christmas present for my daughter-in-law. It is very delicate looking while being a solic piece of jewelry. Was happy with my purchase. <end>  Just Right  I was looking for a dragonfly pendant that is small, understated, and pretty. This one fits all of my criteria perfectly. It is just the right size and length for me and looks elegant whether I'm dressed up or wearing something casual. I am very pleased. <end>  Dragonfly Pendant  What a beautiful piece of jewelry! I love it! It is delicate and flashy. I had many compliments the first time I wore it. Because it has clear crystals, it will go with everything I wear. Reasonable price & fast shipping. Great gift to myself! I will probably order a few more to give as gifts. <end>  A lovely thing!  I wear it every single day! It is beautiful, its the right size. I've had it for a very long time and it has not yet dropped any of the stones.My 8 month-old son often grabs it and yanks on it and chews on it. Yes, I stop him but I've noticed that this is a very sturdy necklace as he sometimes pulls himself to his feet on my lap after grabbing the necklace. Amazing!I love it, great purchase! <end>  great gift  I bought this for my fiance's mom on the Mother's Day.It looks so pretty that I even want one when I saw it! <end>  Perfect for a little girl  I bought this for my little girl who lost her friend (9 years old) to cancer. This dragonfly necklace would symbolize the waterbugs who become dragonflies (a story to explain death) to children. <end>  I love it!  I love this necklace. It is very cute, has great detail, and has wonderful sparkle. I get compliments on this every time I wear it.The dragonfly itself measures just over 1" (length) by 1" (width).I recommend pairing this withSterling Silver 22mm Hoop Earringsor with a simple pair of silver ball studs. I have tried to get matching dragonfly earrings to no avail. Perhaps Amazon will come out with them soon.I think this necklace is great for all ages. The chain looks very delicate and does tangle easily, but it has withstood my 3 year old looking at and touching the dragonfly repeatedly. I suggest storing it on a necklace hanger, rather than in the blue pouch it arrives in. <end>  Worth it  I got this gift for my grandmother for Christmas, and she loved it. It's very pretty and well designed. But it is smaller than it appears to be in the picture, and the chain is very thin. <end>  looked great  it was more petite than expected but well worth the money the way it sparkles when the sun catches it is absolutely gorgeous. i would buy it a hundred times over. <end>  pendent awesome love it, but chain not sturdy at all!!!  The pendent is wonderful, but I suggest you order a sturdier chain if you plan on wearing the pendent. The chain broke the first day I received it. <end>  Dragonfly pendant  Very nice pendant, especially for the money. It is very shiny and just the right size. I do not like that "China" is engraved on the back but that is so small you need a magnifying glass to see it. <end>  Vibrant  I bought this necklace as a gift along with 2 other dragonfly necklaces that were much more expensive. My girlfriend loved this one the most! I felt the same way, it looks beautiful and vibrant. I would recommend this as a gift to anyone! They won't be disappointed! <end>  Simply Beautiful!  I got this dragonfly necklace from my dad for Christmas. I pointed this necklace to my dad, so he knew what to get for me for Christmas. The necklace is prettier than the picture shown here. I love it. <end>  Gorgeous  Just Gorgeous. The chain is a bit chinsy, but replaceable. The pendant is perfect, worth the price without the chain ($15)! <end>  She loves it!!!  Bought it for a special friend as a 21st birthday gift and she loves it. Every time we hang out, I see her wearing it. The chain looks a little too thin and weak but after couple months its still holding so we'll see. Definitely very cute and recommend it to anyone. <end>  Disappointing  I bought this on sale as a fun piece to wear because I love dragonflies.Based on the reviews, I though this pendant would fit the bill. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and found that the stones were extremely cloudy.Cloudy to the point where there was no sparkle whatsoever. There was more sparkle from the dragonfly itself than from the CZ's. I know it's an inexpensive piece of jewelry, but I expected more based on the reviews.I do however, agree with the other reviewers that the dragonfly itself is a very nice piece, but the cloudy stones render it unwearable. The quality of the dragonfly is why I gave this necklace two stars instead of one.I ended up giving to my young daughter to wear as she liked it. <end>  bought as a gift  This product arrived on time and in good condition. I was surprised that it came in a bag rather than a box, but again, it was in good condition. I gave it to my mother and she loves it. <end>  Dragonfly Pendant  This is a beautiful pendant. Well made, and well defined. Goes well with almost all of the silver/cubic zirconia earrings. <end>  Lovely Dragonfly CZ Pendant  I was pleasantly surprised how lovely this pendant is. Whoever designed the dragonfly did a very nice job. The CZ stones compliments the sterling silver dragonfly body. It all works together and I just wish they had some earrings to match it! Too bad it doesn't come in other gemstones for color. I would definitely buy this pendant again and you can not beat the price. These prices Amazon offers is comparable to costume jewelry.The only thing I would change is the chain it came with. It is of a thinner quality. I would try to find a longer and stronger chain for the pendant. It still deserves 5 stars for quality and beauty. <end>  A lovely piece of jewelry - great value  My wife LOVED this at Christmas - the pendant is the right size, the chain was good quality, and the necklace as a whole looks great. Definitely recommend this piece! <end>  Very pretty  The only thing that I did not like about this item was that they shipped it in a drawstring pouch, which meant that when I opened it the chain was completely tangled. It took my husband 45 minutes to untangle it. I liked the pouch, but it is not good for a necklace.I think that this is a great gift for a teenager or a pre-teen.The pendant was more pretty in person than in the picture. <end>  Very nice  I bought this for my mother as a birthday gift. It is very pretty and she loves it. It can be worn casually and also looks nice more dressed up. It came in a little velvet bag which was inside a larger box. It was not tangled up when we opened it. <end>  dragonfly pendant  very nice, and she loved it!!! I got it in plenty of time for the event, and she was tickled pink. Thanks!!! <end>  bug  Wife liked it. Its first cousin[the damsel fly} is also the newly named state bug of Nevada <end>  Very nice pendant  Pendant is very beautiful and has a good size. It is not too big, and not too small. Nevertheless, the chain is as tiny that easily make a nude. I recommend to sell it with a solid chain. <end>  Not as attractive as one would think.  I thought this thing would just BLING out of the box but it did not. I asked my wife what she thought of it and she just said it was good. That means to me it's not the cats meow. It is very small and again doesn't really sparkle. <end>  Very cute.  I bought this for my sister as a Christmas gift and she loves it. Nothing wrong with the pendant. No complaints whatsoever. <end>  Very nice for the price  This was a gift and my lady loved it! Not to big, not to small and just the right amount of sparkle. Great for the price! <end>  Very Pretty Necklace  I absolutely love it, almost didn't want to give it away as a gift!Only complaint I have about this purchase was the packaging sucked! Not even a jewelery box?? Necklace was a little tangled because of it. <end>  very pretty.  dragon fly is just like the pic shows. chain is a bit thinner than i expected, but nice just the same. <end>  Beautiful  This arrived and its just the right size. Overall, a beautiful little piece, and i think she'll like it, but if she doesn't, that isn't really its fault. <end>  Gorgeous!  The picture doesn't give it justice! It's beautiful! This will definitely be a show stopper at Christmas. Great gift idea! <end>  Sparkles  My husband purchased this for me!! It is beautiful - it shines like real diamonds. Recommend all men to surprise your love ones with this awesome pendant. And ladies, buy it for yourself!!! <end>  Stand-out Dragonfly  Purchased this lil guy for a special somebody, as such I was sending it as a gift so I wouldent know what it looked like first hand. Clearly the idea of a gift is to put a smile on someones face, but by the pictures and from reading various reviews the only way to know for sure is if you try it and buy it.If its not up to par when it arrives at the giftee's location then just the thought alone of trying to do something nice should suffice. But boy do I hate wasting money on something that dosent deliver on whats promised in descriptions and photos during online shopping.That said my gift arrived on the estimated delivery date and put a huge smile on her face, its not always about how much it cost but if the sellers description lives up to what your trying to accomplish by purchasing something like this for someone or yourself.I believe it certainly did. <end>  PERFECT!  This necklace is just gorgeous and has been getting soo many great compliments. I would definitely order another one for my bestie and recommend this product. <end>  Another nice piece from the Amazon.com Collection  I had been eyeing this pendant for a while before purchasing it. I really count on the reviews to give me an idea of the value, but being the bargain shopper I am I always want it for less. Recently this item was offered for 50% off and I decided to buy it as a gift to myself. I wore it the very next day after receiving it and I can honestly say it is a nice pendant. As with all of Amazon.com Collection pendants the necklaces that come with them are very light weight and may tangle easily, but the price can't be beat. The Dragonfly on this one sparkles nicely and is a good size for most women (Just over one inch in height and just under one inch in width) If you also like to wear earrings, I recommend some sterling ball or cz/diamond studs with this.Platinum Overlay Sterling Silver 8mm Round Cubic Zirconia Martini-Set Stud Earrings <end>  Wife loves anything dragonfly  This is a good value for the money. Wife has worn it since I gave it to her. Actually looks better in reality than in the photos. <end>  Sterling Silver CZ Pendant  This is a beautiful pendant. It is much prettier than the picture. Very sparkly and just the right size. Not too ostentatious. Spent about twenty minutes untangling the chain which came all knotted up. Best to keep it in the little drawstring bag it came in with the chain locked and outside the bag. Then put it in blue box it also came with.Very pleased with this item. <end>  Great gift  I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She is a dragonfly collector. She was very thrilled with this piece. When my wife is happy, I'm happy. <end>  Outstanding for the price!  I purchased this as a present for my friend of 30 years, and am positive she'll love it! The pendent itself is beautiful, with wonderful workmanship. The crystals really sparkle. I was afraid that it was going to be tiny, but the size is perfect. The chain is a little on the light side, but could certainly be swapped for another, if necessary. All in all, I couldn't be happier. Once I saw it, I couldn't help but think whoelse I should get one for! Good choice for any age. <end>  Nice necklace!  My wife looks this piece! She gets compliments from everyone (well, only from women). The price is right and the quality is excellent! <end>  Way Smaller Than Showcased  From the image, I thought this was fairly large. It's not in fact. I looks cheap too. I bought this as a gift and opted not to give it. <end>  This is Beautiful  This Dragonfly is Beautiful! It really shines and the jewels really stand out. It is the perfect size, not too big and not too small. It is perfect for an adult or a child. I was too originally receive this as a gift for Christmas but I never received it, Amazon was SO AMAZING and sent it next day to me! I am so happy with it. The only bad thing about it is the chain is a little flimsy but for this great price you can replace it easily. What a great quality product. <end>  wifes present  beautifull dragon fly, great detail, great size not too small, chain is a bit on the skinny side though, but for the price, you can replace the chain... <end>  Pictures do no justice  I didn't expect the pendant to be so beautiful. The photos on here do it no justice it is absolutely gorgeous. The chain that comes with it is lovely as well but it is way too small and you will need a bigger one. I bought this for my sister as a Christmas gift and she couldn't stop exclaiming how beautiful she thought it was, it made even me gasp when I took it out of the box. Delivery was very timely but the packaging needs work because the chain was all tangled when I opened it. Overall I think this is a wonderful product and highly recommend it. <end>  somewhat disappointed  The necklace was very pretty and the individual I bought it for really liked it. However, I was very disappointed to discover, upon my sister opening her gift, that the chain of the necklace was all tangled up. It took us an hour to unknot the mess. <end>
 B000MFD9TW  Sterling Silver 6 Row Marcasite and Crystal Ring ||	  Very Good Ring  Ring arrived quickly and in excellent packaging. The marcasite really makes the ring. If it were only cubic zirconia, I would return it. The CZ part looks kinda cheap and a bit "glue-y". But for what it is, it's a great cocktail ring to wear out or everyday with business-wear. Sizing is true.Very Pleased overall. <end>  Runs Small In Size, Not As Bright  I bought a size 8 and could not wear the ring on any finger. It's very small and will need to be returned. Would suggest buying a size bigger than you normally wear.The silver bands with the CZ stones are not very clear, almost white and it throws off the attractiveness of the whole ring. The Marcasite stones are very beautiful and would have balanced better with a truer silver. <end>  It's beautiful, but...  I fell in love with this ring when I found it, and gave my husband a lot of hints about it this time last year. Fortunately he got the hint and I started wearing it Christmas Day. I wore it so often though that it started rubbing wrong on my finger, and after a few months I noticed discoloration on the band and on my finger. On top of that, I noticed that the little stones were falling out. Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful ring, and I wore it all the time, but for having it less than I year it should not have worn out so quickly.Consider reading other reviews on this product before you buy it. <end>  Pretty but Stones Fall Out  For the price of this ring, I think it is low quality. Several of the stones have fallen out.  -( I would not recommend it. <end>  poor quality  The ring is beautiful and I loved it for about a week until one of the stones fell out. <end>  Very Satisfied  I bought this item as a gift and the recipient is very pleased with the product. This was a good buy especially since it was a gift for my mom and she's fond of Marcasite. <end>  Love this ring!  I have short fingers, and this product even looks good on me. It sparkles nicely. Stones are small enough that they look like they could be real diamonds. <end>  Beautiful, but it might not be sterling silver....  I bought this for a gift. I had to return it once because it was too small and isn't true to size. I am returning again now, because the recipient told me it turned her finger green. I don't think this can be sterling silver if it is turning fingers green. I love all the Amazon products, but this one should be evaluated so this doesn't happen to others. <end>  Love this ring  I really love this ring. Fits well and is a good quality ring. I get lots of compliments on it. <end>  LOVE IT!  This ring is so pretty! Exactly what it looks like, so no disappointment there. it is also true to size. <end>  LOVE IT!  I love this ring! I bought it when I lost a favorite of mine, hoping this would be a close second....I LOVE IT! I get so many compliments on it! I ended up finding the lost ring (Of Course!) but wear this one more often than the old on now anyways! <end>  Love it, bought it twice  I bought one for my friend, after I bought one for myself. Lots of comments, it's very pretty. It does catch a little on fabrics though. <end>  Love it  I love it ,,, I love it again and again .... I love it ... love it .....I love it <end>  Beautiful, BUT...  The photos here almost don't do the ring justice - it is truly very pretty and eye-catching. I don't think I've ever gotten so many compliments on such an inexpensive piece of jewelry. However, as others have said here, within weeks, the stones started falling out. I got the ring two years ago. Within a year and a half, the ring had lost so many stones that it was unwearable. Granted, I only paid $39.00 for it, and I really wore it often; so I suppose I got my money's worth. I gave it three stars because it was so pretty for a short time. I got what I paid for it. If I wanted something to last for years, I should have looked for something more expensive. <end>  ring  I love it because it's so pretty. I get compliments from everyone. I definitely would purchase it again and the cost was the best, under $40. <end>  Love it!  We chose the ring because it perfectly fit our daughters style. She loves it and wears it proudly. Great ring for the price! <end>  Looks great but a tight fit!!  I loved this ring when I bought it but was so bummed out because it didn't fit!! Since the ring is so large (it takes up your finger up to the knuckle), you need to buy this ring one size up. So I returned it and got the next size up. So happy thay I did!! I've also received many compliments!! It's also perfect for a right hanbd ring!! <end>  Sterling Silver 6-Row Marcasite and Crystal Ring  Absolutely beautiful!!!!!!! Crystals shine like diamonds! I have gotten lots of comments on how gorgeous this ring is! Girlfirends were jealous! <end>  No regrets with purchase  Bought this product about 1 yr ago. Of course it looks more sparkly in the picture, but it's still beautiful. I wear it almost every day. It's my cheapest piece of jewelry and it yields most compliments. It's comfortable to wear and looks good with almost any attire. <end>  poor quality  I have had this ring 2 weeks and a stone has already fallen out! Very disappointed. I have no idea how to return it either. <end>  girlfriend loves it  I bought this ring for my girlfriend for her birthday and when she got it,she said I Love it , I Love it. My only issue is I orderd it with several other items and everything got shipped seperately.So it took 3 days from her birthday to get everything I orderd that same day I place the ring order.I guess you can look at it as the gift that keeps on giving. <end>  Have had a change of heart!  Even though I was a little curious after reading some of the negative reviews about this product, I bought it anyway. In a nutshell, I would agree that much of what has been said about the quality is unfortunately true.The silver is much thinner than it appears in the picture - not the width of the band on the finger, which is substantial. But the thickness of the silver comprising the band. The CZs sparkle very nicely; but the marcasite is not a good match, the way it appears to match up in the picture. That is, the marcasite casts a rather disappointingly dull sheen, which does not contrast all that well against the more brilliant sparkle of the tiny little CZs.All in all though, its the design of this ring that I love - that's the only thing that kept me from returning it. Would have looked much nicer had it had another color of faceted stone embedded in it instead of marcasite. But again, it was awfully tough to tell from the picture.9/17/10Since it's happened again, figured I should set the record straight and update my rating of this product, which I purchased over 2 years ago.Just got back from a business trip this week, where it has happened AGAIN - got a bunch of really nice compliments on this ring from people I met. A couple of interesting things you might want to know if buying this product 1. Although I was initially disappointed in the thickness of the silver, turns out it is an extremely comfortable ring to wear because it is not too thick (sometimes thick rings will pinch).2. I had complained about how 'dull' the marcasite is. Once you get it out of your mind that they are NOT supposed to look like black diamonds or onyx, turns out the contrast between the marcasite and the czs is really rather interesting.3. I'd initially thought the czs were too small. Well, probably because of their size, everyone thinks this ring is 'real'. That is, the hue of the silver reminds people of white gold, and they assume the czs are diamonds. I wear this ring interchangably with other 'real' rings, so no one even considers the stones might not be diamonds.4. All stones in my ring are intact, and the silver is in excellent condition (even though I've worn it so regularly over the last 2 years).The first time she saw it, my husband's aunt (a well-heeled jewelry fanatic with a great eye for quality) grabbed my hand and could not take her eyes off the ring. And she could not stop talking about the 'diamonds'. So much so that I began getting embarrassed about how much $$ I know she thought I spent on it, and had to finally confess to her that it wasn't 'real'. She was absolutely shocked!Over time, this ring has actually become one of my 'go-to' pieces when I'm wearing black. And nearly every time I wear it, I am complimented on it.If this one would break or lose stones, honestly, I'd have to buy another one! <end>  It's okay  Initially it is pretty, but for the price it isn't very much. Looks and feels like it would break in a few months. The thing is itchy against your fingers. You can't really tell the black is there. The picture is, in this case, alot 'prettier' than the actual thing. <end>  Disappointed  I was so excited to get this ring!!! But within a few hours of wearing it my finger had turned green!!!! I have other sterling silver jewelry and it's never had that effect on me before. Makes me doubt it's made of sterling silver. Bummer. Very disappointed with this product. <end>  Beautiful  This ring is as nice in person as the picture describing it. I really have enjoyed the ring. However, I had one of the stones to come out of it and I have not had the ring that long. (so this was a little disappointing) <end>  Better on the Pic  I love Sterling Silver & so I thought this would be a classy-looking piece. However, the crystals were very dull & the fit of the ring runs Very small. I wore it once uncomfortably, & was frustrated because I don't give away items that I myself don't like, so it was a waste of $$. <end>  Don't waste your money  This ring is INDEED MUCH NICER looking in the photo, it's very thin, and not enough room on the finger. Amazon.com should be ashamed for false advertsing, or misleading people...I fault myself though, because I usually do the reviews first, but this time I fell in love with the way it looked, and just ordered it..I'm totally disappointed, and will NEVER buy another ring from amazon.. <end>  Cute but...  Turns my finger green after 1/2 day. Feels smaller in size than listed...probably due to how tall it is. I would wear it more often if it weren't messy afterward <end>  After initial setback, I couldn't be happier  I purchased this ring because I love marcasite and wanted something that would look nice but not too over the top to wear everyday. The first ring I ordered did have a crystal stone fall out less than a week after receiving it, however I simply returned it to Amazon, taking a chance on a replacement. The replacement came and looked better than the first one. I wear the new one, almost everyday and couldn't be happier. I haven't had any more problems and it still looks nice and pretty. So yes I agree that you get what you pay for and for the price, I think the ring is well worth the "risk". Happy Shopping!! <end>  Unhappy customer  I have been wearing the ring for about a month and have had many compliments about the ring. However, the crystals are coming out in several spots. I would not recommend buying this product due to the lack of quality. <end>  It's great looking... but not-so-well-crafted...  Its a FINE accessory... a great add-on to an all black or silver outfit... but my first ring had zirconias falling off, and tiny as it is, a missing stone doesn't look that great... i got a new one, but there is still that fear that stones might start coming off when i use it.overall, it looks great, a good accessory... but if you're looking for a more long-term, worry-free ring... that you won't have to check every so often if stones are missing... this is not for you. <end>  Odd ring  in person the ring looks fake and the size is very odd. One side is smaller then the other. So its hard to wear. I got a size 6 and it fits like a 5 on bottom and 6 on top. <end>  poor quality  The ring is quite stunning, however, several of the stones have fallen out after two brief wearings. I usually do not purchase sterling silver fashion rings, so it might be common for stones to fall out easily. I received several comments on its beauty, however. <end>  ring  the ring looks very nice but the stones are not mounted very well. After wearing it for 3 months I lost several stones. <end>  Disappointed  I have had my ring for just over a month and was quite pleased with how it looked,however, I have just noticed there are already 2 stones missing and I am very disappointed. <end>  Pretty Ring  Purchased for a friend from her wish list. She loves it and wears it all the time. I thought it was a bit cheaper looking than the picture made out, but it's inexpensive. <end>  Falling apart after 24 hours!  It does not look nearly as nice as it does in the picture. I received it yesterday and today, some of the stones have already fallen out. Don't bother with this ring! <end>  Not bad for the price  I agree with the other posters that the ring could use more contrast, as in the picture and the silver is quite thin. But it's a nice ring for the price (the CZs are very realistic) and looks substantial on the hand. A nice dress up ring, good for a inexpensive Xmas gift. <end>  Love it!  I received this as a gift for Christmas after adding it to my Wish List.I have been wearing it pretty much everyday since then(8 months) and haven't had any problems with damage or wear and tear.I've received tons of complements on it and I just love how it looks on my hand. <end>  poor quality  After a few months this ring started to break apart. The crystals are coming out of the little shells. <end>  Great "Surprise" Christmas Present for my Daughter  My Daughter had found this particular ring on line. She had emailed it to me as a "wish list" item. This was her best Christmas surprise this year. She did not know I would actually order it. <end>  Sterling Silver 6-Row Marasite and Crystal Ring  I liked the ring at first sight. But I am disappointed that I have already lost some of the stones. Its only been a couple weeks..... <end>  Sterling sliver 6 row crystal ring  I love this ring I can dress it up or down. I wear it daily I have not taken it off since I purchased it. I love amazon. Thank you!! <end>  Horrible!  This ring is very poorly made. I purchased it for a valentines day gift. Within just a couple weeks three of the stones fell out. I sent it back in had it exchanged. I recieve the next one and within another two weeks two more of the stones had feel out. I called asked what to do and ended up having a very difficult return. Not only that but they tried to only give me 80 % back when I was entitled to a full 100. % I would not recommend this item to anyone what so every. <end>  Silver Marcasite/Crystal Ring  I bought this ring for work. I typically wear a size 6 for rings, but bought an 8. I figured since the ring has twists it might not be perfectly smooth and round. I was right. If you buy this ring I would suggest getting a size or two larger to ensure that it fits. For the price the ring is beautiful! It looks great with almost any outfit. It really helps to dress an outfit up. This is a great generic ring that can go with all kinds of outfits. If you are looking for a great day-to-day or even a 'going out' ring I would recommend buying this. However, I would keep in mind the sizing. <end>  Very nice piece, a little small  Thia is a very nice piece of jewelry, looks exactly like the picture, however it runs a little small. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who likes to wear a middle finger ring. The crystals are very clear. <end>  It's very pretty  I got this ring last year and I am very happy with it, it's very pretty and very comfortable!!! I love it! <end>  Beautiful!  I bought this last week because it received such good reviews, and Im glad I did! It really pretty, and not to bog for my fingers. I have short fingers, but it the ring still looks good, and it's not to thick on the side like some rings, which makes it uncomfortable to wear. Great ring for a great price!! <end>  Nice but wide silver ring  The ring is lovely however it is a little to wide on the knuckle, making it uncomfortable to wear all day. Hopefully with cold weater coming, the ring will fit more easily. <end>  BAIT AND SWITCH  DO NOT BUY THIS RING BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET THIS RING THEY WILL SEND YOU A SIMILAR RING THAT IS FLAT THE PICTURE CLEARLY SHOWS THE ROWS ARE RAISED THE RING THEY SHIPPED IS FLAT AS A PANCAKE I CALL THIS BAIT AND SWITCH AND TOTALLY ILLEGAL!!!! <end>  Sterling silver 6 row ring  This ring looks lovely. I wear it with my diamondson my middle finger and love the look. <end>
 B000MFIFOQ  Sterling Silver Marcasite and Cubic Zirconia Figure Eight Earrings ||	  Sterling Silver Marcasite Figure Eight Earrings  These earrings are Wonderful! They look better in person then they do on the website. Also they are not heavy at all. I have the necklace as well and both of them you can dress up or down depending on what you are wearing. <end>  very elegant  The earings are very elegant and exceptionally well priced. Glad I purchased them since they can be worn with almost anything. <end>  Loved the necklace, had to buy the earrings!  As I said I bought the necklace first and was so impressed that I eventually purchased the earrings to go with. I received them the other day and I am very impressed. I really like how part of the figure eight goes behind your earlobe. I have loved most all of the Amazon.com Collection jewelry I have purchased and would encourage others to buy it also. <end>  Good  The ear rings did not look as beautiful as in the picture. Fortunately, it suited the person I wanted to gift this to. So, I am happy. <end>  Marcasite Figure Eight earrings and necklace  I gave the earrings and necklace, sight unseen, as a gift, and they were very well received. I was sent a photo with my friend wearing them, and they are a good size and look nice.The necklace would be nicer with a proper chain fixture on the back of the figure eight. <end>  Disappointed in the real thing  The actual earrings were not as pretty as they appeared in pictures. I was disappointed, but not quite enough to go through the trouble of returning them. <end>
 B000MG68P8  Milk Bands Nursing Bracelet YELLOW QTY  1 ||	  Useful for the sleep-deprived mother in the first months of breastfeeding  I am a second time mother and remembered having trouble remembering the side I last fed on and for how long when in hospital and at home for the first few weeks when everything about breastfeeding is so new. After a couple of months, you don't really need anything like this, but when you are first starting out and are so tired from the delivery and bewildered about having a little person depending on you, this little bracelet helps.I didn't give it 5 stars because the little white markers are very fiddly and often pop off somewhere while you are trying to take on or off- good idea though as the nurses are constantly asking how long you fed and when was the last feeding. So, if you can work out how to use these markers it makes you seem very together when you can answer matter-of-factly in answer to their questions. <end>  Nice to Have  I use this bracelet when I am going out so if I lose track of time or forget what side I nursed on last, I can just look at the bracelet. I've noticed that this bracelet is a great conversation starter - a lot of people ask "What's that bracelet for?"My only complaint is it's a little too big for my wrist and will sometimes turn itself inside out. So, now I just move the bracelet from wrist to wrist. <end>  Great bracelet!  Overall I am happy with this purchase. The material has held up nicely, I never take mine off and I've had it on for almost 5 months now. The only problem I have with the bracelet is the white sliders that are used to help remind you when the last time you nursed break very easily. I think mine only lasted a month or so. They do come with 2 extra sliders but those too break easily. Luckily I don't need them to remind me of the time now, but it is a helpful reminder of which side I nursed on last. I would def. recommend it, esp. in the early days of nursing. <end>  LOVE the idea  i was unable to nurse my first two kiddos but was determined to really try with baby number 3. this band has helped tremendously with feedings, especially in the beginning when i was sleep deprived and couldn't remember anything. the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is the white sliders break very easy. the product originally comes with 4 sliders and all of them broke within the first 2 weeks of wearing this bracelet. i haven't been able to find a place that sells just the sliders. i don't want to have to buy another bracelet just to get more sliders. all in all i would totally buy it again. just wish parts of it were a little more durable. <end>  Awesome Idea, Cheaply made  This is a great idea, the band itself is nice - the little sliders are crap. The whole thing isn't worth more than $3 max. You have to be very careful with the sliders as they snap easily. Its nice that the band comes with an extra set, but after a week of using [and being VERY careful and gentle since i proceeded to purchase even after reading the reviews] both sliders snapped, i've already had to use the spare set. Perhaps if the company made them out of metal or found another way to accomplish the same slider/marker idea, it would be a better product. I got this because i really liked the band part of it, i didn't want any fancy bead bracelet. Heck, maybe i'll design one and make my fortune! <end>  Great idea, but the clips keep breaking.  My wife is using this with our second child. This is a great idea, but the clips keep breaking. They probably should have been made of metal. <end>  good but it broke  I loved the bracelet, especially in the first few weeks of nursing when I was so sleep deprived that I couldn't remember my name, much less the last time I fed. Sadly, after a couple months of use the plastic sliders (used to mark the time) broke. I contacted the company who said they would send me replacements but they never did. Not sure whether I will try it with my next baby or find a new way to keep track. <end>  Nursing Reminders  These bracelets are so great in helping me remember when I last fed my now 2 month old- I wish I had them right when he was born because I was trying to remember feedings with crazy scribbles on notepads next to my bed. I've had lots of complements on them and I LOVE the colors- i bought a yellow and purple one. My only complaint is that the white bracket does fall off after awhile- they should sell more then 2 per bracelet or allow you to buy extra. AFter a month of wearing my yellow one I had to use the white brackets from my purple one... so now I will have to use those brackets for both (All in all- GREAT! I will be buying these for upcoming baby showers <end>  What in the world are these for?  Surely, you've got to be kidding!!!!!!!! New mothers, here is a message for you. Mother Nature will let you know which side to use first and it won't cost you five cents. After breastfeeding my two children, I cannot imagine what purpose these bracelet bands serve except to put money in some manufacturer's pocket. <end>
 B000MK5YHM  Ladies Designer 10 karat Yellow Gold Heart Locket ||	  Beautiful Locket!  What a fantastic locket. It looks a little different than the picture, but still it is large and verybeautiful. Wonderful purchase. Thank you Amazon.com and Elite Jewelry! <end>
 B000ML0DMC  Acrylic Deluxe 3-Drawer Jewelry Chest ||	  Acrylic jewelry box  good item for smaller jewelry. I purchased it to put my bracelets in it and it makes it easier to see what I have. Actually purchased 2 because I liked the first one so much I went back and got another. <end>  clearly amazing!  i love clear! i use this for my makeup. I don't have an extensive MAC makeup or anything like so, I'm a business professional. Just two mascaras, three eyeliners, etc, and it fits it all perfectly. Really cute, three drawers, totally worth the price. <end>  Too small to be of any use  This jewelry box is just way too small to be of any use. I was able to fit (nicely, not crammed) three larger earrings in the top drawer, four necklaces in the second drawer and three necklaces and a ring in the third drawer. This jewelry box has the same dimensions as another jewelry box that I had purchased from another brand, but the acrylic is so thick on this one that the drawers have very diminished space. The box is thick and sturdy, and pretty. I like that it is clear. I just don't have any good use for it, so it will go back and my search for the perfect jewelry box will continue... <end>  Great Jewelry Box  I really like it. It's cheap and it holds most of my jewelry. Sometimes I wish it were a little bigger so that I could put more in it but that's not such a big deal. I love that I can clearly see my jewelry in it! <end>  Cool!!  I purchased this for my girlfriend and she loves it. It is very good quality and is slick looking. She loves to see the jewerly in it and not have to search through drawers to find what she is looking for. Love it! <end>  Beautiful and practical jewelry chest  I love this for storing my jewelry. I can see just what I need each morning. It looks nice on my dresser, too. I have another acrylic jewelry box from HomeAndWine, and so I am a repeat customer. Repeat business really says it all. <end>  Love It  Got this box for my mom to hold her jewelry. It came looks like glass but is a tough plastic. For it being plastic it is very nice and heavy. She loved it <end>  Perfect on my vanity for lipsticks  Nice product. Lucite is clear and thick. drawers move well. Small in size but good for my purpose. Buying a second one to put along side of it. <end>  Small but nice construction  Even though I read the dimensions online, I was surprised at how small it is. I like the see-through acrylic, however, and its compact size may actually be a plus for my daughter (not much living space). <end>  Great Product Sturdy Construction  Great product sturdy construction unlike some light weight acrylic product (it's actually medium/heavy duty). Great for more expensive jewlery and etc. I put my Juicy Couture charms, braclet, collections in it. The padding is great protection prevents scratching and sliding. I am buying a 2nd one for my other COACH collections. <end>  Good quality but VERY small  I read the other reviews but didn't quite get the feel for just how small this chest is. The construction of it is great but it holds very little. Should have ordered the larger one. My bad. <end>  acrylic jewelry box  i bought this product because it matched my earring and necklace holder and I needed something for my rings. It works very well. <end>
 B000ML8EQE  Baby 0.06 TCW White Gold Diamond Stud Earrings ||	  Great for Adult Second Holes  Love these little diamond chips for my second holes. With the screw-on backs, I leave them in 24/7 and don't have to worry about losing them. They sparkle like crazy for being so small. People comment on them all the time. LOVE THEM!! <end>  Baby earrings  Bought as a gift for my niece's baby girl. Not happy with this item. So small it would have gone right thru the baby's ear. Box it came in was smashed and broken and hinge was scotch taped together. Returned it <end>
 B000ML8ERS  Baby 0.06 TCW Yellow Gold Diamond Stud Earrings ||	  Darling!  Perfect tiny little earrings! I love these by themselves in ears with just one regular piercing - they are such a darling little size! They would also look good as a second piercing, as they are fairly low-profile, or in a nose piercing. <end>
 B000MLH3XE  BLACK metal JEWELRY harp Earring RACK stand HOLDER ||	  Not for big clunky earrings...  The other reviewer is right...you can only fit a limited amount of the big dangly hoopy earrings. More suitable for small ones such as studs. The holes are very close together, so you have to sort of skip a few to hang the next ones. It's sturdy, just don't be fooled by the pic, where it looks like you can fit a ton of earrings. =) <end>  Much bigger than previously imagined!  I still haven't counted all the holes in the display to see how many sets I can fit, but so far I've got 25 pairs with more room for others. This arrived in a huge box, bigger than a laptop box, and I was puzzled at first as to what in the world it could've have been. In short, it's sturdy, reliable, and all solid metal. Much needed as I'd previously kept 25+ earrings scrunched up and tangled in a small jewelry box. Perfect for the price, too! <end>  Just Right  My wife has a lot of earings. She likes them to be highly visible and easily accessible. This is the 4th earring display holder we have purchased, all identical items. They are small emough to easily fit on top of the dresser. My wife is very pleased with the look, functionality, quality and size. <end>  perfect!  This is exactly what I was looking for to hold my earrings. It's a little bigger than I thought it would be but that's fine. I like the look of it and I can even put my rings on it. Love it!Also, shipping was super fast. <end>  Awesome  Love this!! I now have something to put all my earrings on without trying to find them in a drawer! eXCELLENT SERVICE! <end>  great organizer  Instead of throwing them all together in a jewelry box, they are now organized and in full view. I wear more of my earrings because I can see all the earrings that I have! <end>  I love this  This is terrific! I can see all of my earrings, and it holds all of them. I am using different earrings that I forgot I had, because I can see them without searching. It also saves me time when I am getting ready for work or whatever. Great buy. <end>  Great little item!  I am very pleased with this earring holder. It is well made and looks adorable with all my earrings hanging from it! My earrings have become a work of art! <end>  Perfect  I just love this stand, its the perfect addition on the dresser to keep all the earrings and sometimes even dangle bracelets on it. Keeps them easily accesabile and helps me decide what i want to wear quickly  ) <end>  Just as I imagined it  I was debating whether or not to purchase this item or Urban Outfitters infamous bird cage earring holder but I am very satisfied with this. Not only was it half the price of UO but it does the job just as well. It looks very elegant and well balanced. I was even able to put my necklace and a few bracelets on the side. In addition, I received it super fast (2 days) with my prime membership. I highly recommend this. <end>  Great Organizer  As other reviewers stated, be prepared to not be able to fit one earring per hole. Longer earrings will definitely cover up rows below them. Other than that, it is a great organizer. It is sturdy and well made, and a great way to organize and display my earrings. <end>  good gift item  I bought this as a gift for my sister in law and she LOVED it. In fact, she got one for HER sister in law. It holds a bunch of earrings, doesnt take up much room and is a nice clean display. Very functional and useful for someone with a bunch of earrings. Holds necklaces on the sides too. <end>  Perfectly Lovely  What a fabulous way to store and display all my earrings! No more orphan earrings, tangled hooks, or lost pairs. And it matches my harp necklace holder perfectly! <end>  saves time  I bought this for my wife because I was tired of untangling her earings and necklaces. It saves me tme from trying to untangle her jewlrey. <end>  Perfect  Does its job. Holds smaller earring though but there are enough earring holders to hold the long earring by taking up two rows. Another down part is its a little tilted. Aside from that great organizer for earring collection. you are able to see all of your earrings. GREAT BUY! <end>  This harp definitely makes music for my earrings!  I am greatly satisfied with the Harp Earring Rack I purchased. It is of excellent quality, and hold a "bunch" of earrings. I got all of mine on, and had some space left over for future purchaes. The material is smooth, with no rough or ragged spots, and the stand is heavy enough that there is no risk of it tipping over as I add or remove earrings. My husband was even impressed with the quality and thinks I got a really "good deal," and didn't end up with something cheap. I definitely got more than my money's worth, and the service was terrific! I would definitely order again from this seller. <end>  Great Jewelry Organizer  This is a great jewelry organizer. As with any product, there are of course a few drawbacks. As people have noted, the number of earrings you can store/display depends on whether you own a lot of studs, or hoops, chandeliers, and what my sister incessantly refers to as "danglies". The horizontal spacing of the rungs doesn't allow for many long or wide earrings, but by spacing them out between pairs of studs, it isn't a huge issue. Speaking of huge, if--like myself-- your earrings tend to be chunky or heavy, be careful! I definitely weighed this down too heavily; the frame is very lightweight.All in all, though, I'm quite glad I bought this. No more sifting through boxes and drawers trying to find a matching pair of earrings--everything is neatly and prettily displayed on my dresser. I can also use the curlicues at the top to store necklaces and bracelets, and thus it's much easier and simpler to coordinate my jewelry and get rid of some of my clutter. It's a nice little rack and at the price I paid, a bloody good value. <end>  I am finally organized  I Love this Earring Rack. I am no longer wasting time rummagingthrough my earrings to find its partners. It is easy to useand it looks nice on my dresser. <end>  Perfect - exactly what I was looking for!  I owne a lot of earrings and love to wear them every day, so this is just the perfect way to have them organised, and makes it very easy to choose from. It is big enough but not too much, and quite pretty looking. I had been looking for something like that for a long time and just absolutely love it and recommend it! <end>  Simply Lovely  The product is exactly as pictured, and the shipping was super fast! Just make sure you realize how big the product actually is when you buy it, this stand is pretty tall and wide! <end>  not for me!  the product arrived and the bottom ring was broken or bent. the columns are too close together and doesn't give adequate room in between for long earrings. It is great if you have a lot of small, short length earrings. allows for lots of them to be placed on the rack. <end>  Very Handy  Very handy!!! All my earrings and bracelets are displayed so I can SEE what I have. Reasonably priced. Bought one for my silver and one for my gold. <end>  Love this for my earrings!  Great for earrings! I also out my necklaces on the side hooks which is an added bonus. Dangly earring can take a couple of rows but I just make them overlap. <end>  Exactly what I wanted!  If you have a lot of small earrings this is perfect! It was money well spent. I have nothing negative to say about this earring rack!! <end>  Sturdy and Elegant.  I don't remember if measurements were listed but this was a bit larger than I had expected. Nonetheless I'm a happy camper and it's going to make a great gift for my friend who doesn't have a large collection of earrings, but enough to need an option to neatly store them. It seems pretty sturdy and the swirls give it some elegance allowing it to serve also as nice home decor. <end>  GREAT!!  I needed something to house ALL my MANY earrings & this did the trick! I just wish it was bigger & rows were spaced differently since I have different shapes & sizes of earrings. But I LOVE IT!!!! <end>  Very cute  I got it for my jewelry and I love it, it's beautiful. One little thing though, the black paint comes out easily, had it for a few months and it's already coming out a little bit. <end>  Black Metal Jewelry Harp Earring Rack Stand Holder  When i ordered the Earring rack stand holder i did not expect it be decorative as well! It really does hold alot of earrings! And it's gorgeous too. My friends all want on for themselves. i would recommend this for anyone who needs to have their earrings organized neatly. <end>  Like it  I really like the way this looks. It holds my earrings nicely. My only complaint about it is that there was a patch of rust about 1/2&#34; wide on the back of it. If it wasn't for that, I would've given in 5 stars. <end>  love it  Great for holding all kinds of earrings. I really love it. really good for displaying some of your costume earrings. <end>  Good Holder For the Gal with Lots of Earrings  An earring holder is an earring holder, for the most part, though I bought this one, because earrings are all the jewelry I wear, so I needed a holder that did not also have places for rings or necklaces or anything of that sort. My favorite thing about this product is that on either end of it, I can use the curled pieces to hang my big hoops from. <end>  Perfect!  I wasn't sure how big this was really going to be or if it was good quality, but it is amazing! Perfect for all the earrings I have! I definitely recommend this product if you have a lot of studs. <end>  Great Rack  I wasn't sure how sturdy this earring rack would hold up to my numerous earring collections, but it did its job perfect! I absolutely love it and am so glad I purchased 4 of these. The display looks very nice & trendy and it's much easier to pick out my pair of earrings with just a glance from the rack. I would definitely recommend this product. <end>  very nice.  i decided to get some type of a jewelry tree when my old case was no longer capable of holding all my jewelry, so i went with this one. NOT dissapointed, has TONS of room to hold all types of earrings. i have dangly, studs, and hoop earrings hanging from mine and you can even hang a bracelett or 2 from the top swirls, but its too short to hold any necklaces, but thats alright with me i keep them separate. very nice looking can sit on top of a dresser or counter, not too big more on the medium scale of thing, and seems to be durable so far. <end>  love love love it!  This has to be my best purchase from Amazon! period!And they look so pretty with all my earrings on it that I don't even want to remove them to wear  D jokes apart.. very practical and quite elegant.. Love it. Going to order 2 more for my friends <end>  Perfect earring/necklace holder  This is perfect for earrings and you can hang a couple necklaces on the sides. LOVE IT! Sturdy holder too! <end>  PERFECT; PRACTICAL & ELEGANT  what a find! I had wondered for so long how I can organize my earrings in a way more suitable then previous (jewlry trays). I was almost dumping everything on the counter to find the matching pair. I looked at some seemingly ingenious fabric holding that were quite contemporary and different. But, in the end, they looked cheap although they were around $50.00. Also, dust would become a problem over time. Anyway, I absolutely love this black metal stand which I keep on a tall dresser. Looks great. The height reduces space, yet allows for such great organization. I SIMPLY LOVE IT! The fact that it will hold bracelets, necklaces or a watch on either side is just a bonus.jan 2012 update. Still going strong over 2 years later. The price has gone down since then too and it was a bargain back in 2010. I recently purchased one for a friend who spoke its accolades too. Organizing is such a great thing. <end>  It does the job  I could not think of a reason to give it less than four stars, but five was out of the question. Quality control in its production was not a terribly big issue; the black enamel finish is good, but some of the earring-holder strips were bent. It will serve its purpose adequately. <end>  Earring stand  This does what I wanted it to do. It sits stably on my dresser, and allows me to be able to organize my earrings by type. <end>  BEWARE!! Will cause your jewelry to tarnish!  When I first bought this, I really liked it! It can hold more earrings than I have, as well as necklaces and bracelets. Stylistically, I give this jewelry rack 5 stars -- aesthetically pleasing, and does the job!However, BEWARE  it will cause your jewelry to tarnish!!! I put all my earrings on here -- a mixture of white gold, sterling silver, and crappy ones bought from Icing and Claire's. Tarnishing is caused by oxidation, and the better the metal (ie platinum, gold, silver) the less it should tarnish (relative to nickel and other cheap metals). I've only had this rack for one month, and for some reason, ALL my sterling silver started tarnishing -- that includes 2 different necklaces and 2 different pairs of earrings. My white gold jewelry is fine, and for the strangest reason my crappy jewelry from Claire's is fine (I'm assuming there's some protective coating on it??) but all my sterling silver is turning color!!!!  (Such sadness! I really liked this rack and would have given it 5 stars. However, it caused four pieces of my nice jewelry to tarnish and so I just put them back in their box.. which defeats the purpose of having a jewelry rack. And those four pieces of jewelry are ruined too  ( <end>  Perfect! Out of 5-10 jewelry racks on here, this WON!  Definitely what I needed. I have A LOT of earrings [I posted a picture for my review, the one with all the feather earrings on the right]If you need something pretty, affordable, and convenient. GET THIS! I highly recommend it. <end>  Great gift for mom, now I want one!  My mom had asked for something to hold her jewelery in, and I thought this would be space efficient and pretty. It came already assembled and ready to go! My mom really liked it and it looks great with all the earrings, bracelets, and necklaces on it. Really good price too - I think I might have to get one for myself! <end>  Nice & big  My daughter has a lot of earrings, so this is very handy. Good quality, looks nice. You won't regret buying it. <end>  Very nice  My wife wanted a larger holder for her ear rings. Well, this certainly holds a lot!! She is very pleased. <end>  Great organizer and cute design.  This is an awesome piece for organizing jewelry from earrings to necklaces. I have gotten great use out of this and it makes a great gift for the jewelry collector. It is very sturdy and looks great on my dresser. <end>  this is awesome  Has more than a hundred earring holding holes, its simply brilliant! I had been looking for a jewellery stand since a long time and unable to find something in the store which met my needs, I turned to Amazon. I wish I had looked here earlier. The product's quality is good, the paint is not worn off or something. The only reason I did not give it one extra star is because after holding my necklaces on both the sides, there's not enough space left for my bracelets, but that's okay. I was looking exclusively for a earring holder anyway. <end>  Pretty and useful  It's a very useful item and besides, it looks nice on a table in my bedroom. I am enjoying it very much. <end>  Terrific for displaying earrings  I'm organized and like my jewelry to be easily displayed so that I can pick out what will go best with my outfit. This allowed me to display my earrings by color and the swirls on either side at the top are great for hanging rings, necklaces, or bracelets. GREAT VALUE! <end>  Nice  This piece is well made and balanced correctly. It holds plenty of earrings and dangling ones as well. My daughter likes it because it looks musical. <end>  Great for pierced earrings  I purchased this with the other jewelry holder for my pierced earrings since there was less room between the rows. So I have one for pierced and one for my dangle earrings. Works great and nice look. <end>  Awesome!  I just got this today and I'm already over the moon about it. It's a lot bigger than I was expecting and it looks really well made. I'm addicted to earrings and needed something better than a box to organize them. This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. <end>  Great product!  This is a great product. There's plenty of space for earrings. My only issue is with the curly ends for necklaces. They get easily tangled if you put a lot of them on there. Otherwise, I really love this sturdy holder and hope to use it for a long time to come since it's so well-made. <end>  Paid More in Retail Store  Hi,I purchased this item in a local Drug/Gift Store last year (2009) and paid $12.50 more for the same item. <end>  Great!  The perfect earring holder for a great price. I just got it today, and I'm already happy with the product. I don't think you'll find a better deal. <end>  Nice, but very large  It arrived in a very large box along with my other order, a heavy textbook. There was nothing preventing them from thrashing about in the large box, no bubble wrap, no paper, nothing. Besides that, the stand is larger than I had hoped for, there is more than enough holes to fit my earrings, and then some. <end>  What I Needed  So far so good!! After searching through the different items available on amazon, I decided to go with this one because of its reviews. I was not disappointed. The quality is good. It has lots of room for many pairs of earrings, such that after I received this product, I wanted to go buy a lot more pairs of earrings to fill it up. <end>  Earring Rack Stand  Today I received both of my black metal earring racks shaped like a harp. I bought 2 identical ones because I have about 100 pairs of earrings. Am I ever happy! I love it's look and it's very sturdy. I skipped some row/bars to allow the longer earrings to hang without covering up other earrings. That meant that I used about 2/3rds of the holes. Thus, each one is holding less than I thought I'd put on there, but with 2 racks, I still have room for more (not that I need anymore earrings!). It looks pretty, the earrings are easy to see for the day's selection, and it's great for organizing them. When I run out of holes, I'll get a third one for sure. <end>  Solid, Sturdy Earring Holder  Bought this for my wife for Christmas. It's heavy, wrought iron. It's fairly big, and can hold a lot of earrings. It's base is very sturdy, and it won't tip over, which is what I was somewhat concerned about. The loops at the top can hold necklaces and such. I give it a 4 star because I wish it had more room for necklaces. But, I've seen a similar style-design with lots of stowage for necklaces, but it has a much larger footprint - I think I saw it on Amazon. My wife likes it, though, nuff said. <end>  Sturdy and Pretty  This earring holder is made with integrity, it's very simple and goes with nearly any decor. It also has tons of room for small hoops and stud earrings. I'm overall impressed with this purchase. <end>  It does its job.  I've had mine for a year now. It's sturdy, still black and has handled everything I've burdened it with. It's footprint isn't too wide, either. <end>  Exactly what I needed  I received this a couple of years ago when I put it on my wish list, and just came across it again now and realized I never reviewed it! It's a great earring holder, just what I needed, and I also put some necklaces on it to. I bunch them up and hang them on the loops, but now I'm thinking about getting their necklace holder thingie too now that I have gotten a lot more necklaces over the years.Anyway great earring holder! Looks nice and is very sturdy  ) <end>  I love this earring holder!  I have several of these earring holders. They hold a lot of earrings, they are sturdy, and (best of all--for me) they have a music motif. (I collect music "stuff"). And they are great if you have larger/longer earrings that are hard to put on "standard" holders. <end>  Great earring holder!  this product is very pretty and very useful too. It arrived quickly and I'm very pleased with it. <end>  Huge disappointment  Ordered two of these to give to young girls in our family for Christmas this year. They arrived during an 8-day power outtage so I didn't open them right away, assuming that they were fine since so many people reviewed them favorably. I finally opened them to check them out today, and was very disappointed. One of them had a warped base and didn't sit flat on a flat surface (it rocked). The other was even more bent, it looked like the leaning tower of Pisa. Sending them back for a refund.I should note that the two I received are a slightly different design than what's pictured. The "curled under" parts at the top of the harp, instead of tapering into a point like the one pictured, have just a blunt cut-off end. This does make the harp slightly less attractive... but more importantly, tells me that they have changed the way they make the product since some of those favorable reviews were posted. As a result, overall quality of the product seems to have suffered.If I had the guts, I would attempt to straighten the warped and bent metal myself, but I am afraid that I might destroy the entire product and then be stuck with it. The soldered joints don't look stable enough to tolerate manipulation. Perhaps if I'd spent five or seven bucks apiece on them, I would give it a go. But the product was fairly expensive (for what you get), and I'm not willing to eat the cost.Sorry, I REALLY wanted to like this product (and have some of my Christmas shopping done). <end>  Fanastic earring holder  I bought this earring tree several years ago and have been happy with it ever since. When I first bought it, I had read a review that suggested that one should cut the third and the sixth rung off of it to allow it to hold longer earring styles. I cut off the third rung with a little hack saw and will eventually cut off the sixth. It is perfect! Once I got this holder, I loved it so much I started really getting into buying earrings to help fill it up. Now I have a beautiful collection all neatly organized and nicely displayed. This is a great product. <end>  Not too bad!  The earring holder holds so many earrings! Its great! My only complaint is that when you are putting any earring on it that isn't a stud (like dangle or chandelier earrings)then it falls on top of the earrings below them. Its not really a big deal and its totally something that you can deal with. So, other than that I am extremely satisfied with it!! <end>  Earring Rack  I design and make handcrafted jewelry. I ordered this to display my earrings. Even though the claim is being able to handle multiple pairs of earrings, I found it to be too cramped to overload. Nowadays, with earrings being long and large, the spaces tend to make the earrings overlap each other and my customers can't define each pair. So, the rack holds fewer pairs. If you just need this for smaller creations it would work out fine. <end>  Pleasantly surprised  This earring stand is sturdy and holds most of my earrings. However, it's not good for hoops. Some of the holes are not usable because they are so close together; the shape of some of my earrings make it necessary to skip a lot of the holes, so it doesn't hold as many earring as advertised unless you only have small studs. Still, I'm pleased with the purchase. It probably holds more earrings than most women have. <end>  5 Stars - DEPENDING ON WHO THE SELLER IS!  I first got this a few months ago and I loved it- ordered two more (different seller) and it was HORRIBLE QUALITY! I originally bought from sunrise which when i went in my order history, it is now called dazzaling gifts - their product is great quality - Zoohu was HORRIBLE (chipped, etc) and MyGifts was a peice of junk and not even the right color - glazed over and not solid.Amazon should be more careful who they let sell since some have some really cheap knockoffs. <end>  Perfect!  This earring organizer is exactly what I needed. I don't have a TON of earrings, but my collection is growing and I wanted a convenient and attractive way to display them. The holder seems very sturdy, and does not wobble at all. It also came with the correct amount of rails, unlike some other reviewers have stated. I compared a lot of racks before deciding on this one and I couldn't be happier with my decision. <end>  Its alot bigger than you may think....  This thing is cute dont get me wrong, but its a lot bigger than what i saw on the web. but its cute decoration, and another bummer is that is has odd numbers of holes so the earing dont match up with every hole. <end>  Nice Earring Holder for price  I received the item very quickly and in good condition. The only reason for the 4 stars vs 5 is that there was a couple scratches on the black paint. <end>  Great "music" themed earring holder  This harp-shaped earring tree is great! It fits all of my earring collection, plus some of my favorite necklaces, bracelets, sunglasses, and rings. Plus, it looks great on my bedside table  )I'd highly recommend this earring tree from MyGift, and will definitely buy again from them! <end>  Black metal jewelry harp earring rack stand holder  This product is exactly the way it looks in the photo. It's perfect. I finally have a place for all of my earrings. <end>  Excellent Value!  This earring stand is so well made and tall. It holds many pairs of earrings and was an outstanding choice. I can't believe I got it at the price I gave or it! <end>  Looks great  Stand is very nice and doesn't have any balace problems. Holds plenty of earings, bracelets, and necklaces and keeps them visible. <end>  earring rack  The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled. It suits the purpose for which it was ordered. Definitely would order again. <end>  Great earring rack.  Great rack. I kind of wish the rows were further apart for longer earrings but I even use the side hooks for earrings and bracelets. I would recommend this item. <end>  she loves it  it was a gift for my gf and she loves it. i also no longer have to worry about earrings littering every coffee table in the house <end>  Great! Would definitely buy more  Love this I bought two and then bought 2 more. Great for all of my earrings. Good Quality and Good price <end>  Love this product!  This is an excellent product. I hung all of my earrings, its is also very sturdy and gives your bedroom a "chic" feel.I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to buy. <end>  Superb earring storage  Easy to find my desired pair of earrings with this attractive storage stand. Holds many pairs, esp. if you insert a pair of French-hook dangle earrings into one storage hole. I hang lots of necklaces off the ends. No more fishing through many jewelry boxes to find what I need! <end>  Holds a lot of earrings neatly  I've had other earring trees, and always ended up over-crowding them and creating a mess. This has tons of room (especially if you use one hole per pair), and everything stays neat and untangled. <end>  beautiful  I really love this. I bought two because I would need to hang all my earrings and necklaces. Great item. <end>  Everything I expected  Very happy with my earring rack. It will go perfectly with my other jewelry organizers. Very sturdy design that will work for many years to come. <end>  My wife Loves it  My wife is writing this review...I just love this Earring Rack...I spent at least 5 minutes trying to fish out the earrings out of my tray...it never failed, I would find one and took me forever to find the other.With this rack, I have them all neatly displayed and at the ready.It is black and goes well with my sterling silver trays that I have on my dresser.This was a good buy! <end>  Beautiful and functional  Good for dangly earrings or stud earrings with metal backs to them. It looks great in my room, like part of the decor rather than my jewelry cluttering my surface spaces. I love it! <end>  Great product  I just received it in the mail. No complaints at all. Very good for the price, and I am 100% satisfied with it. <end>  Very nice, but bigger than I expected  This earring rack is bigger than I expected it to be and it totally awesome! The side hooks are great for bracelets and necklaces and there is tons of space for MANY earrings. Exactly what I was expecting! <end>  Good product !  This a good simple product.It is nicely made, solid and good looking.I will buy more for future jewelry shows. <end>  earring harp holder  Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Plenty of room for all of her post earrings and rings. Good guality find and better yet - great price. <end>  My Daughter Loves This!  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and she was thrilled! It has sturdy construction, and plenty of room for all her earrings. An unmentioned benefit is that you can hang necklaces from the loops at the top. <end>  Good quality  This earring holder is cute and practical. It seems really sturdy and displays jewelry nicely. The only thing that I would point out is that it doesn't really hold too many earrings. I where longer dangly stuff and I could only fit about 30 pair on there and they overlap each other. <end>  product does the job  Earring holder holds around 80 pairs of earrings which is just what my mom needed for all her earrings. The only thing I would change about this holder would be to alter the distance between each row to accommodate different length earrings. But my mom is using it right now and loves it. <end>  My sister loves it.  i got this for my sister for Christmas and she loves it! good price and it's pretty big so it can fit a whole bunch of earrings. it's kind of hard to see on the picture but there are small holes in it for all of your studs. <end>  I Love these! ........I've bought several!  I Love these!........I've bought several!.....BLACK metal JEWELRY harp Earring RACK stand HOLDER....they hold a lot they're well made and makes it easy to store and find things!~ <end>  love it  This is the best thing I have bought this year! It is so much easier to keep organized, no more looking for a pair of earrings. It is easy to use and looks great on the dresser, I got one to give my best friend for her birthday as well and she just loves it too! <end>  Attractive + Useful... a Winning Combination  This rack is even more attractive than pictured. Very sculptural. I am concerned by the 1-star review that complained about their jewelry being tarnished, but I suppose only time will tell. Perhaps a coat of clear nail polish on the stand could help? <end>  Big and useful  I ordered this product as a back up till I could afford something bigger and better and when it arrived, it was way bigger then it had appeard in the picture. It works perfectly with the amount of jewerly I currently have. The only thing about this, is that it's not really ideal for necklaces but that is ok because I have a diff location I put them. <end>  Does what is is made to do.  I bought this to hang all of my earrings. It works fine. The holes could be a little further apart as I had to skip a hole between some of my larger earrings. Looks great in my closet and appears to be sturdy so far, even completely full. <end>  I can see them all!  I am so pleased with this earring holder! I can put both wires and posts on it, see where they are and better make a decision about which ones I want to wear. <end>  Earring Tree  This is just what I expected, my earrings are now organized and I can find the pair I want to wear instantly! <end>  Works great and looks nice  This earring tree holds all of my earrings, even the dangly ones. You just have to space them appropriately. It never tips over and it looks so pretty on the counter. I love it! <end>  great buy  The first time I saw this earring holder I knew it was exactly what I needed, and I was right - this holder is perfect to keep my jewelry organized in a very stylish way. It was delivered in time and in perfect condition. It has enough space for all my earrings, and I also can use those nice side curves to store bracelets and watches. I ordered it together with necklace holder (also by Artful Jewelry), and put them together on my toilet table, which added some decoration to the room. I'm sharing the picture so everyone can realize how it looks with jewelry on it. Well, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to everyone. <end>  Earring Holder - excellent product!  I am happy with this product... it shipped quickly and my earrings display very nicely on this. <end>  turns purple immediately. awesome design  wonderful ultimate disc, 175g, awesome color changing effect, comes white and turns purple under even a little bit of sunlight. <end>  earring tree  I was looking for a nice-looking earring tree to put on my new bathroom counter and found this. It really looks great and holds many pairs of earrings of any type, <end>  Very nice for the money  I, like the other reviewers, was looking for a way to easily organize my earrings. Based on the reviews I purchased this one. It's sturdy & looks fine on my dresser. It holds alot of earrings however only if you have studs or tiny earrings will hold all that is says it will. I have alot of dangly & hooped earrings. I had to pretty much skip every other row & I put all my large hoops on the bottom, to allow for maximum room. I've put 30 pairs of earrings on it & there is still room for a few more pair but not many. I gave it 4 stars still, because for the money.. this is a great purchase as long as you don't expect to put 70 pairs of earrings on it. I also hung some of my necklaces on the top sides which is a nice plus. <end>  Earring Racks  These earring holders are great for my show displays. Holds lots of earrings while easy to view. They're just what I needed. <end>  Love it!  I haven't had this for very long, but already I love it! Previous to this, I was using a screen that was super glued onto a circular stand. It was too small and my earrings looked incredibly cluttered on it. With this one, they are nice and neat and with the space between bars, there is plenty of room for my dangly earrings as well. <end>  Poor construction  I returned this because the horizontal bars were not all straight, some of the earring holes were off center, and the horizontal bar connections to the frame were not flush. It may have just been that I got a defect. <end>  Great earring holder!  This is a great earring holder, absolutely love it. Holds earrings very well and displays them cleanly. The only change I'd make is making the bottom bar higher up. You pretty much can't use it to hold earrings since long ones above will cover it up and there isn't enough room below for earrings to dangle properly. <end>  Love it!  This is a wonderful product. I had a large collection of earrings and it did a wonderful job of organizing the pairs. I had to skip some holes in between each pair so I could clearly see all of the earrings and even skipped rows below for more spacing but that's only because I have big earrings. My main purpose was to have somewhere I could put my earrings so they wouldn't get tangled up with one another and a place that didn't take up too much space and this did the trick! Great product for the price and it arrived rather quickly which was even better! <end>  Great  I really liked the shape of this and there are lot of holes to put your earrings in. Overall I love it and would recommend it to all my friends. It's a great way to display your earrings instead of rummaging through piles of them. <end>  Pretty and functional  I really like this earring display harp. Doesn't take up much space and saves me time in the morning...no more searching for the other earring!  ) I would recommend this product to a friend. <end>  Practical jewelry organizer  I bought this item because I have way too many pair of earrings. This organizer allows me to put together all of my earrings. Also, it allows me to look at my collection instead of going through boxes while picking the colors I want. Good buy! <end>  Didn't know I needed this  I was focused on a necklace holder and would not have considered the earring rack had it not been offered as a package deal. I am so glad it was! Now the tiny studs are in plain sight, not hiding in a tangle of necklaces. No more putting in one earring and not being able to find its match. If you love organization and efficiency, you need this! <end>  Very useful!  I needed a better way to store my earrings, and now they're easy to get to and on display! Glad I bought it. <end>  Perfect for all earrings!  I have hoops, studs and dangling earrings, this holder had organized all of them so I am not searching for a pair ever! <end>  Lovely!  i got my ears pierced for my 15th birthday, including cartilage, and needed a holder. it holds a lot of earrings, i put them in the same holder. it's pretty too, i got it in black <end>  Does the Job Nicely  I have several jewelry armoires and two jewelry boxes. I could never keep track of all my earrings. This sits on my dresser sideways so that it does not take up a lot of space. I can see my earring selections at a glance and they are not tangled and separated. Great solution to my earring problem. I can now enjoy more of them without searching through the menagerie - esp. when I am in a hurry. <end>  Stylish alternative to displaying your jewelry  I was looking for an earring holder that was aesthetically pleasing as well as functional; this served as both & I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The earring holder was larger than what I thought it would be but I am nonetheless satisfied with my purchase. It's sturdy & does a beautiful job displaying my jewelry; I am more inclined to wear my jewelry when I have such a beautiful display of it. <end>  Just what I needed  I looked all over the web for something to store my earrings and of course I should know to rely on Amazon. This got so many good reviews and I have to agree with everyone. I really love this. It's perfect for me to see my earrings. I had way more than I thought I did so I'm thinking I need to buy another one. Very easy and perfect for my needs. <end>  Clever and pretty  This holder is very cleverly designed - lots of space to put my earrings and it looks so pretty that it has a place of honor on the dresser. The caveat is that the holes are rather close together, so if you have large earrings, its unlikely that you get to put one in each hole. Also, I have a couple of dangling earrings that kinda go beyond the next rung, so that might also lead you to lose a few spots. Finally, one of my dangling earring sets has a flat and wide area at the top, preventing those from going into the holes. So I just hang them on one of the rungs. I don't specifically care about any of these things (hence the 5 stars) but figured others might. <end>  Worth it!!!  I'm trying to look for an inexpensive earring holder but doesn't look cheap. And this is perfect! It looked great, sturdy, worth your money! Very fast shipment. Im very impressed. Im a happy customer. ) <end>  great & sturdy but...  a bit bigger than I expected. It's ok though, the build of the product is strong and the finish is smooth. Shipping was quick; its drawback - I had to sign for it when the delivery guy brought it (I don't know why it required a signature, how weird), but I wasn't home so I had to wait till the next day to get it. <end>  Awesome  Lots of holes to fit a lot of earrings. Stable so you don't have to worry about it falling over. Only thing is the bars going across are pretty close to each other so the longer earrings need to go near the bottom so that they don't cover the earrings underneath them. <end>  Very nice earring rack.  I love the earring rack. Everyone that has seen it likes it. Requiring a certain amount of words is stupid. <end>  Great product  Fast shipping! This product makes my life easy bc I am able to just have all my earrings visible and choose whatever I want. I feel like I need more spacing or it should be higher but I will work with it...It's all about how you place the earrings! <end>  Decorative and functional  Just that, this is very cute in my room but also very functional for my earring collection. Great item, I definitely recommend. <end>  Great  Great Service! Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to! Will order again from this company! <end>  I fit so much on here!  At first I was worried that there wasn't enough space, but I put my studs on the top rows and the longer ones toward the bottom. I am amazed at how many pairs of earrings I have fit on here. They are also displayed so well that it makes choosing my pair of earrings fast, I don't have to rifle through anything. I even use the little hooks on either side to put a few necklaces on, it kinda doubles as an earring and necklace holder. <end>  It's huge!  This thing is massive. Maybe I should have expected that but it was a lot bigger than I anticipated. Will have to reorganize my dresser top to use. <end>  Just What I Needed!  I had been looking for a pierced earring holder for months and didn't see anything I liked until I ran across this on Amazon. I had checked here before but probably missed this one.It's very well made and sturdy -- thank goodness because I am heavy handed. It holds about 24 pairs of earrings but if you have large earrings it may take up four spaces, but that's okay with me. Now my dresser doesn't look messy with earrings everywhere. And a big plus -- they all have the backs to each one now  ) Definitely would recommend this product. <end>  Exceeds expectations - beautiful!!  This earring rack is beautiful, well made and larger than I thought. Holds all my earrings and still has room for more. Functions very well. I am very satisfied!! <end>  Fabulous!  Ordered this after reading the reviews and it arrived today, on time and well packaged.I immediately gathered my earrings from boxes, Tupperware (!) and plastic divider thingies and spent an hour organizing all my ear wear. Who knew I had so many great earrings?How fabulous to see all earrings at a glance, actually in pairs, instead of having to search for mates. It holds a lot of earrings! Pierced, clips; large and small. It also has those curls on the side for large hoops.I would really recommend this product if you have more than 10 pair of earrings (and who doesn't?) <end>  Absolutely love it!! &#9829;  Mine arrived in perfect shape, though I can see why it's vulnerable in transit. I ordered it with a book, which came in the same box. I think this helped holding the harp stand in place and offered some protection in transit - for your consideration.I've had it for over a week and have not noticed any silver tarnishing problem (reported on some other similar products).Now just need to buy more earrings to fill up the gaps.

 B000MLP05W  Men's 4.7mm wide (0.2 Inches) 10 karat Gold Figaro Bracelet ||	  A little flimsy for a men's braclet  Bracelet is much more dainty than indicated in the picture and since it is going to be a Christmas gift for my 21 year old son I am hoping he doesn't think I bought him a woman's bracelet. <end>  What a fantastic piece of jewelry  This is without a doubt the most beautiful,stylish mens bracelet I've ever owned.It's very masculine while retaining it's elegance. WOW!!! I love it!! <end>

 B000MM4U9S  Sterling Silver Sapphire & Cubic Zirconia Brooch ||	  Beautiful!  I ordered this brooch because it matches a pair of earrings that I had. I had been looking for a sapphire brooch becuase I wanted to use a vintage looking brooch as the centerpiece to make a pearl bracelet so I could have a "matching set" to go with my earrings. After a lot of searching and not finding anything, I finally found this on Amazon. It is beautiful and came packaged inside a little jewelry box (like a ring would come in a ring box). It was packaged well in packing peanuts inside a larger cardboard box. It does ship from Ontario, Canada so it took it maybe just over a week (?) to get here but I just had it shipped ground so that was expected. I am very pleased with the brooch and have added my own photos on here as well. <end>

 B000MMC306  Sterling Silver Men's Dog Tag Pendant, 24" ||	  Exactly as it says  This product is just as it's described.Only issue I had was that I thought the actual dog tag would be larger but I shared my own customer images to show the size of it.Silver looks nice and the chain seems durable. <end>  Love this product  I bought this dog tag for myself, and I love it. It is exactly as it's described. The chain is a nice heavy weight sterling silver (it is even marked as .925 to show that it is really sterling silver). I am very allergic to anything that is not sterling silver, and I have had no problems with this chain. <end>  Sweet item...  It actually is a pretty nice piece. I've even slept with it on the last few nights. Not too heavy, but it's pretty cool. <end>  Great Product!  This is a great product; I'm very glad I purchased it! I even waited about a month before submitting a review, just in case something broke or I had an issue with something. So far, so good! I really like the way it looks and feels. The pictures uploaded by the other customer are very helpful, by the way. <end>
 B000MMC324  14k Yellow Gold Ballet Dancer Charm ||	  small but well made  I purchased this for my bracelet. It is small, 26mm with the jump ring, 21mm without, and 6.5mm wide at the tutu. It is 1.5g solid (not hollow)and very well designed. I checked it under a loop and was impressed! If you need a larger charm it's not for you, but I am wearing this on the same link as a 14k ballet shoe, about the same size and it's perfect! I do think they should include the size/weight in the details though. <end>

Its very flashy and very big. if you wanna make heads turn then I think this is the ring for you. People will be complimenting on it all night. <end>  Looks good but cheaply made  Got this ring three weeks ago and was very pleased. Looks great and all the stones shine brightly. Unfortunatly, the large middle stone fell out of it's setting today (without even hitting it on anything). Luckily after a long search I managed to find it. I'll probably use some super glue to keep it in place. <end>

 B000MQKJK8  Pair of Glass Single Flared Eyelets  6g Ruby ||	  Excellent glass plugs!

 B000MQKT6M  2.00 Carats Princess Cut Genuine London Blue Topaz Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Ring ||	  Pretty!  Really pretty ring--beautiful color. Mine did arrive with a tiny chip on the corner of the stone....was pretty inexpensive though, so I don't think I'll bother sending it back. One con is that the two exposed points of the stone are rather sharp...you could really hurt yourself/someone is you accidentally scratched them. Overall I am quite pleased with my purchase--4 stars.EDIT  Two weeks later--have chipped off both pointy tips just wearing normally and given myself quite a nasty scratch as well. Still think it's really pretty, but maybe best for just occasional wear. Downgrading to 3 stars. <end>  pretty ring  I've just received this ring in the mail this week and it is more lovely in person than the photos. There were no chips on the two exposed edges of the stone but they are very crisp and sharp so I've be mindful when wearing this. I thought that the stone at 2.0 carats would be too large but it looks smaller in person towards the 1 carat range because of the cut of the stone. No matter as this is my favorite cut for stones and doesn't look too small on my large hands. I bought this a sized 9 as I wear either 8.5 to 9 and 9 was the only size available at the time. I like how the stone is turned on an angle as it makes it more unique and different and not like an engagement ring. For the price and the stone and quality of the ring, this is a bargain. <end>  Stunning Stone  This ring is a real beauty. Surprisingly, the stone color looks exactly like the main image provided for this product by the seller, not the lighter-colored picture! It is the saturated blue color of a beautiful sapphire at a fraction of the price. The stone is also of substantial size, approx. 1/4 inch square, tipped on its side.Although the stone is very flat, it has depth within the setting. I like the low profile because it is easier to wear for working. Though there are no chips in my ring upon arrival, I will be watching out for the two exposed diamond points at the top and bottom, as they are cut quite crisply and may chip if something hits it right on the point. At the same time, it is not a HUGE investment like a sapphire might be, so I will still be wearing it quite often.Also, the setting is lovely silver, highly polished and not tin feeling. It is hollowed out toward the back of the stone but not too much - there is still a substantial amount of silver.I love this ring and do not regret the purchase. <end>
 B000MQKTA8  1.50 Carats Oval Shape Genuine London Blue Topaz Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Ring ||	  It's Beautiful!!  I love this ring. The stone is much bigger than I thought. I have received many compliments. <end>  Size runs a little big  Beautiful ring. Petite looking on your finger because the 1.50 carats is hidden somewhat by the bevel setting. Good clarity and sparkle. Size runs a little big. <end>
 B000MQLGPK  1.50 Carats Genuine Emerald Cut Peridot Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Pendant Necklace ||	  Very nice piece  I bought this for my teenage daughter, thinking that if it turned out to be junk, that would be no great loss. The price seemed a little too good. What a pleasant surprise! The necklace is as beautiful as in the picture, and my daughter is very pleased. I understand that, long-term, because this is sterling silver, the piece will need to have tarnish polished off. But sterling is much cheaper than gold, and this is a really pretty necklace. The stone isn't too big, the design is graceful. <end>  Better than I thought.  I bought this as a present for my wife who loves peridot and I was pleasantly surprised that it is actually a nice, expensive looking piece of jewelry! She loves it, and I loved the price. I would definitely recommend it to others. <end>  Really surprised  Just received this lovely pendant and was really surprised how pretty it is. It even comes with a nice chain! I expected something tiny or or cheap looking and it is neither. The stone cut and color are beautiful and there is enough silver in the setting to enhance the stone. I intend to wear it every day. I've had compliments on it already. If you're on the fence about purchasing this, don't be. <end>  Beautiful  I bought this for myself, as it is both my children's birth stone. It is great quality and a good size for the price. I wear it daily and shower with it, still looks fantastic. I am a VERY happy customer <end>  So pretty!  This is a very pretty little necklace. I bought it for my 12 year old daughter as a Christmas present and I think she is going to love it. Green is her favorite color and she has been wanting a nice necklace that will not turn her neck green! I think she will be very happy with this for years. Good quality. <end>
 B000MQLKG0  Sterling Silver Round Garnet Ring, Size 5 ||	  Great ring for a great price!  I originally said this as a Gold Box deal. It was $19.99 with some percent off making $10.00 after the discount. I waited and waited until it was the same price again. I kept checking and when it came around again I jumped on it. The only bad part was you had to get $25.00 to get the free shipping unless you had prime. I had my boyfriend get it for me and then I paid him back. I got two rings not sure which size would fit me better.I bought a size 5 and a size 6 and both fit me. They were nice the only part I didn't like was it was stamped Made in China on the inside of the ring. I sort of figured it would be made there as is 95%+ of items sold are made there. I'm happy with my purchase and love the simplicity of the ring. I do think that it does scratch easily and that's probably why I got two sizes. One for everyday wear and one for special occasions. It is my birthstone too!8/6/09I've had the ring for a while now and notice that the color on the ring does change. I'm not sure what chemical or lotion made it tarnish, but it will tarnish in color on the outside. The area where my ring is tarnished is near the stone setting on both sides of the ring. For $10.00 when it's 60% off is a good deal. Any more and you paid too much. However, when the ring is on you, you won't notice the tarnish unless you look carefully. <end>  simply elegant  THE RING WAS SIMPLE AND ELEGANT. GARNET IS MY BIRTHSTONE AND IT WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED. I MAY ORDER ANOTHER FOR MY DAUGHTER IT'S HER STONE TOO. <end>  Much prettier than it looks online!  I like pretty simple jewelry and i bought this on a whim. it is so delicate and beautiful in real life. I love it! <end>  Good for the Price  I purchased this as a gift and my friend liked it alot. However, the metalchanged color a bit. <end>  Love it.  I got this ring as a gift and I love it! I can't stop looking at it. It's so simple and pretty. The metal has not change color like in the other review. <end>  simply beautiful  I am surprised at how much I love this ring. It is just lovely. Very worth the price, as I almost never take it off now! It will become a favorite for sure. Sizing is dead on. <end>  beautiful ring  it's such a pretty ring. i've gotten so many compliments on it and no one knows it only cost $25. i highly recommend this ring for anyone who loves the simplicity of it! <end>  great buy ! a pretty gift  Gifted this to my friend, who wanted one stone ring.She loved it so much, she wore it for so long, the shine of the garnet stone was ever lasting..good choice. <end>  good for the price  I bought this on sale for $10 including free shipping. I don't know if I would pay $25 for it. It looks pretty nice, basically exactly like the picture. It doesn't really look fancy, though, probably because it has such a simple design. The stone is a deep red when you look straight onto it, but when viewed from the side is actually a clear reddish orange. All in all a good buy for $10 but for that price don't expect anything too fancy. <end>  Wonderful  This ring is the greatest ring I've seen in the entire world! The more I look at it the more I like it. Even though at first I thought it was smaller than I've expected, it simplily looks elegant. I love the fact that it's my birthstone. I totally recommand this. <end>  Small, subtle, and brilliant  This is a small ring and I really like it. I can wearing it on my pinky finger and have a larger ring on my ring finger without the two of them clanging against one another.I wear this ring often and notice no obvious dings or places of wear. <end>  simple but stunning  My first ring purchase from Amazon. Never had a ring with so elegant looking but a "low-end" price. Garnet is not my birthstone but this ring caught my eyes by its simplicity and stunning dark red. It looks great on my finger. Really love it! <end>  pretty ring  I really like this ring and gotten compliments on it. It's very cute. The picture matches it pretty well. So far it hasn't tarnished on me yet. I purchased this 2 mons ago. <end>
 B000MQMDPC  Pair of Obsidian Double Flared Plugs  1 inch g ||	  Very Nice  These came right on time packaged quite safely. The finish was near flawless, with a perfect polish job. Both plugs feel identicle in size which was equally impressive. Even at 60.00 a pair they were worth it. <end>
 B000MQMEOC  Pair of Glass Borneo Spirals  4g Ocean ||	  Everyone needs some of these  Perfect size and color, and they make a pretty ringing noise against my other earrings <end>
 B000MQNN1A  Pair of Glass Single Flared Eyelets  6g Crystal ||	  Nice pictures..  I thought the pair came in slightly different sizes. It looks and feels narrower than the normal 6g ear plugs, but I like them overall! <end>
 B000MQNO50  Pair of Glass Single Flared Solid Plugs  10g Ocean ||	  Love it  Just the right size and I absolutely love the color. It was a great buy for me. <end>  Love them.  Great clear, glass plugs. Got them in honey (10g) and smoke(8). Just enough of a wear area to allow for air to circulate as well as short enough to hardly notice they are on when you sleep on your side. <end>
 B000MQNOCS  Pair of Glass Single Flared Solid Plugs  6g Honey ||	  Good for stretching  These plugs look rather darker than in the photo above, both in and out of my ears, more brown than brownish-yellow. I don't know if it's a difference between batches or just the lighting for the photograph.I discovered glass jewellery a couple of months ago and decided to use these for a fresh stretch from 8ga to 6ga (since I'm a science student, to me "g" is "grams" not "gauge"). I used an acrylic taper to stretch my earlobes and put these in by butting them up against the end of the taper. My ears were inflamed for the first few days, so the glass was good since the dried pus and serum a.k.a. "crusties" doesn't stick to it as much as to metal. <end>
 B000MQP656  Pair of Glass Single Flared Solid Plugs  00g Smoke ||	  Not the product pictured, at least not exactly.  The end of the plug isn't really that rounded as the picture shows it. Its more of a cylinder shape, with the edges at the base smoothed a bit. The insert end is not so much this '(' , but more this '['. (To help you visualize) <end>
 B000MQP7BO  Pair of Glass Single Flared Solid Plugs  0g Ocean ||	  sf ocean  I am so happy with these plugs! They are a little darker than the picture shows, but they have an awesome bright "glow" when the light shines through them. The fronts are domed (which I like), and the backs are more flat than the picture shows. <end>
 B000MQQUBA  Sterling Silver Crystals Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  elegant and sparkly  These have what you want for evening wear especially, at just the right "step up" size on my petite frame. They won't let you down. Just that special touch of Swavorski sparkle to catch the eye. <end>
 B000MQTQ0W  Cartouche Pendant - Made in Egypt - with "I LOVE YOU" in Hieroglyphics - Open Style ||	  Cute pendant, great deal  I bought the silver version of this pendant with the 18"Egyptian Silver Accessory Chainas a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, who has a long-standing love for all things Egyptian. It arrived quickly and I was glad to see that it was pretty much exactly as pictured here. She loved it so much, it's something she's always wanted, so I did pretty good this time.One thing that they don't say here is that the hieroglyphs don't actually mean "I Love You," but are rather a close phonetic transliteration from English &mdash; that is, the names of the hieroglyphs used sound approximately like "I love you" when you chain them together. Most people probably don't care about this, and for the similar customizable pendants with peoples' names and such there's no other reliable option, but I thought it should have been made apparent on the product page. I'll try to post a picture of the little guide book they included explaining all of this. <end>
 B000MT5XZQ  Southwestern Style Wolf Paw Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise and Coral Chip Inlay for Men or Women, Size 9, #10519 ||	  Wonderful Present  I purchased this ring for my sweetheart for Valentine's day. He loved it! The paw-prints are very small, but that makes them all the more noticeable, and makes the ring much nicer to wear... subtle, rather than gaudy. I highly recommend it. <end>  Bear Paw Ring  The ring is wonderful!!!!!!! It is a little heavier than I expected, but I'm extremely pleased it is. It is GORGEOUS!! I have gotten dozens of compliments in the short time I've had the ring. <end>  well  well,I received this ring and love it. However, it is not exactly like the one I thought it should be ~~~~However, it is fine I think~ <end>
 B000MT7W0K  Silver Shine - Silver Cleaner with Cloth NONTOXIC ||	  A Great Cleaver  This is a different type of cleaner than I am used to using. The metal inserts really draw out the tarnish, and I'd be willing to say this works better than your traditional sterling silver dip cleaner. The only thing they don't tell you on the packaging is, "don't leave the silver insert inside the dip"! It basically gets eaten apart. Once that lesson was learned, I never turned back. I would highly recommend this product for home or business use. <end>  Works as advertised  My wife was quite happy with the results she got with this product on her silver jewelry. She had to do a little buffing after the treatment, but the stuff was much prettier after all was said and done. <end>  It's a quick cleaner  If you want something to do a quick clean on your silver then this is what your looking for. I cleaned about thirty pieces of silver and then the cloth was used up. <end>
 B000MUOM66  1.25 Ct.T.W. Genuine Round Swiss Blue Topaz in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Cross Earrings ||	  Very pretty  I bought these earrings for my 15 yr old daughter, who is tough to buy for, and she loves them. They are very pretty and yet a touch edgy, the quality is acceptable, and with the on sale discount, the price was fair. <end>
 B000MUOMA2  2.00 Ct.T.W. Genuine Trillion Cut Garnet in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Earrings ||	  high quality, beautiful stones  I got these as a gift for my mother, and they are just beautiful. Sparkly, shiny, very nice! <end>
 B000MUTBEO  Southwestern Style Horse & Pony Story Band Ring in Sterling Silver for Men or Women, size 11, #10825 ||	  Beautiful Detail  This was purchased as a gift for my 16 year old niece. She loves horses and is an avid rider. She loved it. The detail was impressive and it's not big and bulky. Very dainty. <end>  hores band ring  I have alot of rings but cannot wear certain kinds at work-since I am such a horse lover-this is a perfect ring for me to wear on my job- I gave it a good rate because it is durable in the hard work I do -and the price is right- love this <end>
 B000MVM1X6  Green Bay Packers Flashing Earrings ||	  This item was a gift.  This item was a gift for a friend. She really enjoyed them and wears them all the time. hello mom and dad! <end>
 B000MW5PM4  Oval & Round Shape Ruby Pendant Earrings Set in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  The perfect Set!!!!!!  If you are looking for a set that sparkels this is the set. The created rubies are beautiful and just as detailed fiery red. If you have long hair don't worry the earrings will show up just fine because the earrings are long enough. The pendant is also large with a larger created ruby in the center. Don't think that the sterling silver in this set is thin and delicate because it is NOT. It is very well created and has a very nice weight too. This is a keeper! <end>
 B000MW5PMY  2.75 carats Radiant Cut Citrine Pendant Earrings Set in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  beautiful set!  very nice quality jewelry for a reasonable price. got it as a present for my sister in law who's birthstone is citrine and wanted to keep it for myself!  ) <end>
 B000MW5PVA  Round Shape White Cubic Zirconia Pendant Earrings Set in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Awesome...better than expected!  I was a tad leery at first; after all, the picture does not do much justice! I thought; cubic zirconia and sterling silver? I took a chance and what a pleasant surprise! Believe me, this set is gorgeous;perfect for any elegant night out or any occasion in between. Not at all what I expected; I am pleasantly pleased with this purchase!!! <end>
 B000MW8NOG  3.75 carats Princess Cut Peridot Pendant Earrings Set in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  don't like  my husband got me this set for christmas, if he hadn't bought it for me i would have never gotten it for my self. i opened the box and was shocked, not with joy but with a feeling words just can't discribe. i love my birth stone but hated what it looked like in this set. they are to big and weight way to much for ears. i do not like them at all, but of course i'm not telling my husband that, i told him they were interesting and big. i was hoping he would return them, but he didn't. he actually likes them. If someone is thinking of buying as a gift, think twice because most people i showed this set to HATED IT. <end>
 B000MW8NS2  3.50 carats Princess Cut London blue Topaz Pendant Earrings Set in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  very lovely  I received a gift certificate for Amazon.com for Christmas and after spending 3 days searching for just the right gift, I chose the London blue topaz earringUniquely Dreamy 3.50 carats Princess Cut London blue Topaz Pendant Earrings Set in Sterling Silverand necklace set, set in silver. It really is quite lovely and well worth the price! It took just a few days to get here and I am quite happy with my purchase. <end>
 B000MWEF8E  14k White Gold Diamond Key Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  As shown  The charm was as shown too small for me I gave it to my daugther she loved it <end>
 B000MWEGJC  14k White Gold Diamond Lucky Dice Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  buyer beware  The picture looks better than the product. There are only 5 sides. The sides are not even square, being about 4mm x 5mm. On regulation dice, the sum of opposite sides is supposed to be "7", but the 5 is opposite the 3 and the 4 is opposite the 2. The 6 is opposite nothing, as the "1" side is open. The presentation was very nice, a velvet drawstring bag within a gift box. With the cost of gold being what it is, this probably the best they can do for the price. Maybe you should buy a magnifier to go with it. <end>
 B000MWEGOW  14k White Gold Diamond Fireman's Shield Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Feminine style Maltese cross  My eighteen year old daughter is an interior qualified firefighter for our town's volunteer department. When she completed her Firefighter 1 training, I wanted to give her a Maltese cross. The majority are masculine. This is a very high quality white gold charm. You must see it to believe how truly beautiful it is, looks very expensive. Heavy weight in hand. <end>
 B000MWEGU6  14k White Gold Diamond Snake Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Delicate beauty!  I got this necklace because lately the snake has become my totem animal and I wanted a reminder. This pendant is nicely detailed with diamonds alternating with a couple of bands of plain gold. It is delicate and not ostentatious at all, very classy. <end>
 B000MWGC2G  14k White Gold Diamond Ballet Slipper Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  ballet charm  This was a perfect gift for my grandniece, an aspiring ballerina! She wears it on a chain araound her neck. <end>
 B000MWGCJ4  14k White Gold Diamond Initial "B" Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Perfect Sized Charm  This charm was pretty and the perfect size for the bracelet I wanted to put it on. This charm had a nice weight to it and the diamonds were easily visible. I feel the price I paid was worth it. <end>
 B000MWGCR6  14k White Gold Diamond Initial "T" Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  not quite as pictured  This charm fits the size description but when you actually see it in person, the diamonds are just specks in the charm and not at all how they appear to be in the photo. I'm glad I only paid a cheap price for it or I would have sent it back. <end>
 B000MWGD8O  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Crown Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Pretty design --Poor Quality  This delicate charm is dainty with small diamonds. However, within 2 weeks the last diamond on the row at the base of the crown fell out leaving a gaping hole. Then yesterday the charm "snapped"off its hinge making it unusable. <end>
 B000MWHGH6  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Soccer Boy Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  great Mothers Day gift  I love this!!! My husband says our son bought this for me for Mothers' Day... our son is 9 months old!! I love the way we can use Amazon for surprises for each other. I love this pendant! It is easy to see that it is a boy, he has a little smile on his face, and oh how it sparkles!!! <end>
 B000MWHGNA  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Scooter Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  rip off!  returned the item due to recieving white gold instead of yellow gold nd never got my new charm or a refund. <end>
 B000MWHH02  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Medical Symbol Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Very Beautiful  This charm is gorgeous! I was very pleased with the quality of the diamonds. Though they are small, they sparkle and are easy to see. The only down side is that the back is not engravable with medical information. But it surely will catch the eye of emergency personnel due to its beauty, and they will know to look for info in your purse. It is VERY well worth the price. I highly recommend. <end>  disappointing  The picture of this looks great, but in person the chips are microscopic. In fact, they are almost invisible. It's a cute charm for a bracelet, but that's about all. As jewelry, or the perception of jewelry, forget it. <end>
 B000MWHHRA  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Frog Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Very nice charm, but concave on the back.  For the price, it would have been nice for it to have been 3-D. It's nice sized and very pretty, but feels a bit flimsy. This is a review, not a complaint. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this charm...I'd just have been happier to have gotten it at a lower price. <end>
 B000MWHHXY  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Sailboat Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Beautiful  I was looking for a sailboat that would be big enough to show detail, but not so big as to overwhelm the other charms on the bracelet. This one fit the bill. It's sparkly without being overly gaudy. Good quality. <end>
 B000MWJFGG  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Pacifier Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  really cute  The overall look of the charm is great, really sweet. I only wish it was not hallow and flat on the back side of the charm. I do love the hook closure makes it fun and easy to move them around on your charm bracelet or place it onto a necklace. Most charms do not have this type of closure. It makes for a great gift. <end>
 B000MWJFXY  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Masonic Symbol Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Nice CHARM to add to a bracelet  This charm is small and beautiful ... the hook on the charm broke after 1 week ... considering the price I was shocked at the small size and the fact that it broke so quickly ... BUT I will not return this product because I do love it despite the downfalls <end>
 B000MWJG4M  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Initial "P" Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Need to Return this item  I already have a problem with this item. One of the small inside diamonds fell out and is lost. My wife noticed three days after Christmas. Other than that ok with purchase. <end>
 B000MX0HH6  AugustinaJewelry AAA Quality Akoya Saltwater Cultured Pearl Bracelet 7-7.5 Inches 6.5-7mm White Pearls ||	  A little disappointed  I purchased a necklace and earring set from Augustine Jewelry, so I thought I would buy this bracelet to complete the set for my wife. I'm no jeweler, but the quality does not seem to compare to the other set, even though they are both rated as AAA. The color of the pearls doesn't match as well as the necklace and earrings.AAA Quality 18 Inch Round 6.5-7mm White Akoya SaltWater Cultured Pearl Necklace & Earrings Set <end>
 B000MX3T6C  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Martini Glass Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Very nice  I looked everywhere for a martini charm for my sister's 21st birthday. I had a hard time finding something that looked quality. This charm is gorgeous. It is a little smaller than I expected, but worked perfectly with the charm bracelet. <end>
 B000MX3U34  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Racecar Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Racecar charm  I really like the way this charm looks. The price was definitely right. The shipping was very quick. I would purchase from this seller again. Thank you. <end>
 B000MX3ULG  14k White Gold Diamond NYC World Trade Center Skyline Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Lovely memento.  Beautiful charm. A nice memento to remind me of the offices we once had at WTC. <end>
 B000MX60AY  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Owl Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Too small, throw it back  This charm was so small, it didn't match any I already have. It was advertised as on sale for $99. At this tiny size, it was no bargain, even on sale. I returned it. <end>
 B000MX94XO  14k White Gold Diamond Sea Turtle Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Great sea turtle  Hard to find marine life charms. This one shows detail well. This is not the charm if you want to see BIG diamonds, but if you like to see accented areas. Goes well with all the other charms offered in this series by Amazon. <end>
 B000MX94ZC  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Frog Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Very nice charm, but concave on the back.  For the price, it would have been nice for it to have been 3-D. It's nice sized and very pretty, but feels a bit flimsy. This is a review, not a complaint. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this charm...I'd just have been happier to have gotten it at a lower price. <end>
 B000MY24OE  14k Yellow Gold Round Diamond Solitaire Engagement Ring (1/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  very good quality  The diamond looks pretty big. For the price, it shines brilliantly. The color doesn't look very white though. But you don't expect K color to be very white. Overall, I think it's pretty. and I am very happy with it. <end>  Are you lucky enough?  I bought 2 of these rings when it was 70% off.Thus, the quality/price ratio is very good.However, the I3 clarity is impossible to satisfy everyone.There is something in the diamonds. You can see it with naked eyes.In sum, it's just a diamond ring on the right hand. And don't let your friends have a close look on it. I think it's OK for the $47 I paid. <end>  Good deal  This is a good deal  $50 for a 1/4 carat ring. The ring looks good. I would buy another if this deal appears again. <end>  Made my morning!!!  I just received this ring this morning and it is outstanding. I was worried that it would have black pieces all through it. I am no expert, but I did not see one black mark. It is a little cloudy, but overall looks great. If you are on a budget and need a really nice ring, buy this. <end>
 B000MZDVCC  AugustinaJewelry Freshwater Cultured Pearl Earrings 7-7.5mm White Pearls with Silver Mount ||	  Beautiful pearls  The pearls are beautiful and mountings are nicely made. They go perfectly with the necklace my mother-in-law bought for me in China, and they look exactly in person like they did in the photo. I highly recommend this vendor for their jewelry. <end>  Not so crazy about them..  Not really what I expected, but for the price I guess its OK. The pearls look nice, what threw me off was the mounting. I don't know if it was because of the material (silver) but it was rough to slide out the back piece. Overall its good for the price. <end>  I love them!  I ordered these for myself from a Christmas Amazon gift card - I was MORE than pleased with them. I am ordering another pair for a present. <end>  Love them!  I gave these to the 'ol lady for Christmas. She loves them, was exactly what she wanted and I picked them out!! <end>  Excellent price for nice cultured pearls.  I gave these pearls to my girlfriend and she loved them. The price is quite reasonable. I always comparison shop when I purchase jewelry and these were exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted. These pearls are also a very good size and they are big enough to be seen, but are not ostentatious. They matched the necklace in size and color.The pearls were delivered quite rapidly. I will probably purchase jewelry from this seller in the coming months. <end>
 B000MZXRV2  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Hoop Earrings (1/6 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Not for the price  Unless you really are in love with gold and dimonds, i wouldnt recommend these earrings, number one they are two small for the price, of course they always seem bigger online but I Amazon need to have a "actual size" image. Number two, you can refund them even though you havent worn them and just took them out the boz to see what they look like. And if they do they take a certain percentage out. Dont get it, they arent worth the price --sw <end>
 B000N28G3S  10k Yellow Gold 3-Stone Diamond Ring (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Pleased  I got this in white gold. I'm pleased with the purchase. Remember its only a quarter carat (small size diamond) cut up into 3 stones and of course the pictures of jewerly always appear bigger than what the stones really are. The band is a nice size and the ring is everything I expected it would be. Small and simple. <end>
 B000N2BURC  10k Yellow Gold Diamond Ring (1/2 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  diamonds are very low quality  this was a very disappointing ring....the diamonds are very poor quality...will never buy fine jewlery online again.My jewler told me its worth less than half of what I paid.. <end>
 B000N3DAFG  Fleur-de-lis Silver Natural Seed Pearl Earrings - Dahlia Vintage Collection ||	  Sweet chandelier earrings  Spouse and I both picked these after much study of Amazon offerings as perfect for our mid-twenties daughter, who loves dangling earrings. She absolutely loved them. I'm sure she realized it was a mighty special present for a mighty special young lady, judging by the pleasure she took in opening her gift. Most of her jewelry is costume, and these are the real thing, something unique and pretty to hand down someday to her own daughter. <end>
 B000N4KY1S  Solid 14 KT White Gold & Gleaming Garnet Gemstone Flower Pendant 14k Charm ||	  Beautiful design and garnet color!  I received this as a gift and it is just beautiful! The design of the flower is lovely and the true garnet color is very nice. (deep burgandy with brown/amber tones...not bright ruby red) It is rather delicate and you need a nice white gold chain to put it on, but overall I think it's a unique way to display the birthstone for January. <end>
 B000N4U42C  10K Yellow Gold Pink Sapphire J Hoop Earrings w/ Diamond Accent ||	  Beautiful earrings!  I purchased these for a gift, and was tempted to keep them for myself. They are very pretty and well made, and the stones are especially nice. They are smallish earrings, but the quality is there and they are a good value and beautiful gift for yourself or someone else. Nicely packaged for gifting.I would love to get these myself. <end>
 B000N4WEXY  Designer Two-Tone 18 Karat Gold Unique 37 Diamond SPINNING Anniversary Ring ||	  elegant yet masculine ring, company top notch in integrity  This stunning spinning diamond eternity band ring is quite simply a fine work of art. I am proud to announce my martial status to the world with it spectacularly reflecting light from my left ring finger. The workmanship is top notch. My only complaint (and it is a minor one) is that the spinning yellow gold portion of the ring has a brushed satin finish unlike the mirror polish of the inner white gold portion of the ring. That minor point aside, the ring matches the picture exactly. Ring is nicely wide (9mm) with a satisfyingly heavy weight to it. The band is very comfortable with no harsh edges. !!!Be very sure of and double check your ring size before ordering as this ring can NOT be re-sized!!! However, mine fits perfectly. The diamond yellow gold portion of the ring spins smoothly with no resistance.I had never ordered any jewelry thru the internet before and was a little nervous about the idea. But, this incredible ring just seemed so unique that it captured my imagination. I took a leap of faith and was not disappointed. Considering the ring was made to order, it was delivered in a surprising brief amount of time. I received mine in just 13 days.The company profile for Elite Jewels says "We hold an ethical obligation to always represent our consumers' best interests with the respect and dignity they deserve, regardless of their monetary investment." THIS IS NO IDLE BOAST. I was somewhat suspicious that when I ordered my ring that the internet price was erroneously TOO LOW and that Elite Jewels would inform me of this and cancel my order while informing me of the correct price. THEY DID NOT DO THIS. They honored the price as it was and my ring still shows the finest standards of craftsmanship. This level of integrity is a rarity and should be applauded . I would not hesitate to order from them again. Place your trust in this company and they will not disappoint you. If I could give this item and this company SEVEN stars, I would. <end>

 B000N5R57I  Two Tone Good Looking Men's Diamond Wedding Ring ||	  Really Just an OK Ring  This ring, I am sorry to say, Looks very inexpensive in reality. The diamonds look fake and strange, and I am really not at all impressed with it, My husband likes it, and I guess for the price I paid, I didn't get a bad deal, I was just not happy with the overall look of it, once it arrived, like I stated, it looks cheap. Maybe I should have known that the item name, being "Good Looking men's Diamond Wedding Ring", should have told me it was just a Good ring, nothing more.S <end>
 B000N5UWLY  10k White Gold Classic Diamond Circle Pendant (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Elegant, Everyday Necklace  This necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift. She wears it everyday with every outfit. It looks great with jeans and a t-shirt AND with an extravagent dress. <end>  Modest and Honest  This is a perfect anytime gift. I bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. We have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top. Perfect for any occasion. She'll love it.This will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anythingPlus it's under 100. Can't beat the price. Thanks amazon! <end>  perfect size, very classy, not gaudy  Was extremely pleased with this item, my wife said it was exactly the size she wanted. Understated elegance. Less is more!! <end>  Great Buy!  This was the first time that I purchased a jewelry online and I'm so glad I did!The pendant is elegant and shiny, never mind that the diamonds are tiny. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this buy. I bought a similar one set in yellow gold, offline, for double the price and it didn't even come close to this. <end>  pendant gifts  I received this for my birthday as a gift and loved it so much that i bought it for 2 people for graduation gifts <end>  nice but small  This is a nice yet smaller than I expected diamond circle pend. <end>  Great!!!!  Yeah I know the title is cheap, but I just woke up so sue me! ;-PThis was the first gift I got my girl friend when we first started dating. She absolutely loved it! You can't go wrong for the price. It's exactly what is advertised on the site. <end>  Perfect Present  This Pendant is a perfect present, it's cute, nice and so soft. Girls love this kind of Pendants and also its mean alot for them specialy its a ring Pendant. I recommened you to buy it if you are looking for something cool! <end>  Much too small  The picture of the pendent on Amazon looks much larger than the actual pendent. It is difficult to see the diamonds at all. I returned it. <end>  Very pretty  I bought the necklace as a gift for myself. I didn't really have any expectations as to how it would look, I just thought it looked beautiful in the pictures. And I was pretty much right, it's not as large as I thought it'd be but it is a very pretty piece to have. It has adds a great shimmer to your look and it can be matched with a dress or a simple top and jeans. I would buy it again and maybe an extra one for my sister. <end>  Great item, great price.  The necklace is great. It looks great and my wife loved it. One of the diamonds was a little gray (something stuck behind it), but after having it cleaned at a jewelers, it looks fantastic.Great price for a great item. <end>  Diamond pendant  The pendant was much smaller than I had anticipated. I did not read any details before ordering. The workmanship was also disappointing. <end>  Great Product  Outstanding service - product was as described and the price was fair - mailing in a timely manner was acceptable. Will continue to shop for similar items via Amazon. <end>
 B000N5XFMW  10k White Gold Diamond Ring (1/8 cttw, I-J Color, I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Great deal, and still not worth it  I purchased this ring during a sale with an additional 40% off, so I got it for $50. It still wasn't worth the money because it's ungiftable. It's very pretty at first glance, but a closer look revealed that the accent stones on either side of the center were extremely crooked and randomly sized. A couple of them had visible chips in their highly polished surfaces, easily visible under light. They look like random shards crammed into the setting. It's quite tacky when you look closely, and I'm returning it.I was very disappointed, this was supposed to be a Christmas gift and I was looking forward to giving it. The design and center stones are gorgeous, a tiny bit more effort in the manufacture to better match and straighten the accent stones would have made a huge difference in the quality of this ring. <end>
 B000N5Z91M  10k White Gold Diamond Bridal Ring (1/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  great purchase for the price paid  I am very pleased with the ring.

 B000N62HM0  10k Yellow Gold Diamond Bridal Set (3/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Diamonds are not like picture  The diamonds are not the same quality as the photo.They are more cloudy in the main stone the ones on the bands are a little clearer.

 B000N6326A  14k White Gold Dangle Earrings (1/8 cttw, H-I Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Tiny!  These are gorgeous but tiny! I made the mistake of not reading the fine print and noting the size. I don't mind small earings but these take the cake! <end>  Bought for Mothers Day  I bought these earrings for my wife for mothers day. Didn't exactly pay attention to the size. They are somewhat small but she still looks beautiful in them. I am happy with my purchase. <end>  Very small but nice  Bought this for my wife as part of the deal of the day. I did not realize how small they were though the page shows the scale, other than the size these are nice ear rings. <end>
 B000N6327O  10k White Gold Split-Bandolitaire Diamond Ring (1/10 cttw, H-I Color, I1-I2 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  Very nice stylish ring  This is a very nice ring. The diamond is a little larger than I expected and I love the sleek simplicity of the unique style. This would make an excellent promise ring, but I bought it for myself just because I thought it was very pretty! I give it 5 stars because it met what I wanted and a little more. <end>  Good purchase  Excellent quality, nicely made, sturdy band. I would have gladly paid a bit more for a tiiiiiny bit bigger diamond. Alternatively, sticking to the same stone, I would have enjoyed seeing it being placed a bit more up. You see, I knew what to expect, but my major "complaint" is that the diamond is a bid "buried" between the two legs.Still, I would buy it again.Last note  it is a ring where getting the right size is very very important. I buy some of my rings a size bigger (for the sake of convenience). This is the first ring were a size bigger was annoying. The band is too wide for such experiments. <end>  Love my Ring!!!!  I bought this unique, beautiful diamond ring for myself, I'd been looking at several other's but I kept coming back to this one. I really liked the setting, it was not the same old kind, and when it arrived I felt I'd gotten a good deal on the perfect ring for me. <end>  Beautiful  This ring is beautiful, I love it. The only thing is that it was bigger than I expect so I returned it and made a new order for one smaller size which fits great. The ring looks nice, just what I was looking for!!! <end>  Can't stop looking at it!  Got this ring today. It's shiny, unique and beautiful. The diamond is way bigger than I thought it would be and I can't stop looking at it. Very unique and simple ... very happy with this purchase thanks Amazon! <end>  Better then expected  Got this for my girlfriend and was happily surprised upon opening the box and seeing how much larger the diamond was then expected. It is a very neat looking ring. for sure unique. i know she will like it. 110% satisfied with this purchase. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful!  I bought this ring as a gift for myself, and I am VERY happy with my purchase. The diamond is a good size, and definitely not a diamond chip. The band itself is quite thick, so getting the right size is important. I am 100% satisfied with what I got.  ) <end>

 B000N64X54  10k White Gold Diamond Hoop Earrings (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  beautiful - just what you'd hope for!  I purchased these earrings for an early xmas present and was delighted when they arrived. Stones are bright and sparkly. They look like more than 1/4 ct of diamonds. Love the hinged design of the earrings.Hoops are about 0.8 inch diameter so are appropriate for teens/younger girls as well as adults and the price was spectacular  $160 delivered! I think they are on par with these earrings 14k Two-Tone Diamond Hoops (1/8 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), which are approximately the same size and also from the Amazon collection. The earrings cited are almost half the price (yes, I bought both). The big advantage of these earrings over the others is the hinge mechanism which means the hoop is 'solid' and the post fits into the solid back of the earring. on the other pair cited, only the post hinges and it secures into a wire catch on the back side of the loop. This design may be more prone to wear and loss if the post becomes unattached at an inopportune time. I'll let you know after 6 months of wear.Both of these earrings are dainty and appropriate for formal or casual wear. I only wear gold earrings because of a metal allergy, so to find diamond earrings at this price was spectacular. Would love to see these in a yellow gold style but the white gold actually makes the diamonds look a more substantial size than they are. <end>  post issues  I got these earrings because they looked great and I liked the review. I too think they are very nice, the only issue is the extremely sharp posts within the hoop. The earring is hinged and the post is enclosed so it clicks shut. The edge of the post is extremely sharp and can tear your ear hole when you are manipulating it into place. I ended up having to put these earrings in my lower holes even though I bought them for my second ones because they punctured the inner cartilage when I put them on. Needless to say, icky.  ( If you have thick ear lobes I would be very weary of buying these because the posts are not wide, if you do not have this issue then these earrings are great and very secure. You won't have to worry about losing them. <end>

 B000N8U4WI  14k White Gold Pave Diamond Ring (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  When they say white they mean it...  Good- nice band, no scratches, feels heavy.Bad- Cloudy white diamonds, one had a big black speck, not even close to clear diamonds...When they say "white diamonds" that is precisely what they mean. The description of the diamonds (H-I color and I2 clarity) is accurate in the ad, the photo (I feel)showed clear diamonds and was not accurate. If you are looking to impress anyone who knows anything about diamonds go to a real jeweler and spend the bucks.I am using this as an everyday wedding band to "replace" my original wedding set. My engagement ring use to catch on everything and this one does not. Now I can put my hand in my pocket without it snagging on the flap for instance. As a lefty the bulky wedding set was a nuisance.This is a good item for everyday wear. I don't have to worry if I lose it or damage it because it was so inexpensive. Basically, I calculated the value of the gold (I figured the diamonds as worthless) and the price (on special sale) was less then that so I really couldn't go wrong here.Additionally, if the seller doesn't provide the weight of the gold (without the gems), karat (10,14,18), and the minimum clarity and color of the diamonds DON'T BUY it. You're asking to be ripped off. Amazon is usually good about providing that information. <end>  I was disappointed.  Nice looking but it was smaller in scale than I expected. It is lightweight. I was surprised that it was made in China. <end>
 B000N8XH2M  14k White Gold Round Pave Diamond Hoop Earrings (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  They are beautiful  The earrings are smaller than I expected, but they are beautiful, full of sparkle and fire and look great with everything. <end>

 B000NBQMPS  Gorgeous! Women's 14k White-gold 5MM (1/2 CT) Moissanite Solitaire Engagement Ring ||	  Very pretty ring  Our wedding bands and my wife engagement ring were stolen a year ago. We have looking for a replacement engagement for six months. All the engagement rings we looked at were either too expensive or my wife did not like the style. When I saw this pretty ring on amazon, I knew my wife would love it. The price was excellent. It came yesterday and I surprised my wife with the ring last night. She was as happy as the first time I gave her an engagement ring seven years ago. The moissanite solitaire shined and glows better than any diamond we have looked at. Went I told my wife it was moissanite instead of a diamond she did not believe me. When I told her the price, she did not believe me. She thought I paid twice the amount that I actually paid for it. The seller, Rich Peel Enterprise responded to my entire questions promptly. Plus the ring arrived two days earlier. <end>
 B000NC119Y  Baroni Sand Dollar Earrings ||	  Not as nice as coated sand dollar  My wife was somewhat disappointed by these "sand dollar" earrings. They looked like they had a lot of gold plate that hid the sand dollar imagery. Maybe they weren't real sand dollars like we expected from our experience in Cocoa Beach, FL. <end>
 B000ND12YC  Mens Channel 1/4 ctw. Diamond Wedding Band 2 Tone Gold " Size 10 " ||	  Disappointed  From the description/picture I expected more. I knew the diamonds were not great quality, but the settings do not look too great. Also, it is VERY light, in fact it somehow has already bent a little so it is now a little distorted. The measruement and diamond quality was accurate, it just does not look as "nice" as the picture. However, delivery time was speedy. <end>  Wow!  The picture does not do justice for this ring. It is absolutely beautiful! If you are looking for a men's diamond ring that looks great and is affordable, I recommend that you buy this one. Very prompt delivery too!M. Brownfield <end>

 B000NGBUNM  White Opal Drop Earrings ||	  Misleading product  I purchased this with the understanding that it was in fact an opal. Not so. The stone is clearly costume jewelry. It is an ugly white translucent stone with barely a hint of color. Also, the stones are on hooks, NOT attached solidly with a full loop so the 'gems' keep falling off the base with any movement. BUYER BEWARE!!! <end>  This is a real bargain!  My wife wears them everyday. She absolutely loves them. These earrings exceeded my expectations and I strongly recommend them to anyone looking to buy something special for the one they love. <end>
 B000NGJ2OG  Sterling Silver Baby Cup Charm ||	  Super gift for new moms  I am very pleased with this product. I like the idea of a clasp b/c it can be added to a charm bracelet, chain or keychain with ease. Great quality <end>
 B000NGJ33G  18k Gold Plated Sterling Silver Multi-Gemstone Floral Ring ||	  I returned the ring because one of the stones fell out  When I spoke with the seller I returned the ring postage paid by the seller and requested a replacement ring. One of the rings prongs was loose and that is why the gem fell out. I found the loose gem and returned it with the ring. The replacement ring is beautiful and just what I wanted to match my earrings, pendant, and bracelet. I like my jewelry to match in design and gemstones. This ring was perfect for me. The fit is perfect to size. I would highly recomment this seller and their products. They guarentee what they sell without the buyer having to absorb the cost of postage. <end>  nice as expected  This was a gift to my mother, and I had it shipped directly to her, so I never saw it first hand. However, she raved about it, so I'm pleased. <end>  18K GOLD PLATED STERLING SILVER MULTI-GEMSTONE FLORAL RING  This item is very delicate looking but is definitely of very good quality. I like the way it looks. Not very wide so it is comfortable on your finger. <end>  I agree, the sizing is a bit erratic I guess...  I ordered a size 7 and this isn't a 7, it's some larger size, but otherwise is an attractive ring. It just can't be worn by the person intended unless we pay more $$$ to have it resized. We've ordered at least a half dozen various, other size 7 rings on amazon and other si tes, so I'd have to guess the sizing method for this specific ring isn't the most accurate.It's ended up in the "pass it on to someone else" gift pile. As I said, it's a nice ring; if you really like it and want to take your chances, go for it, but realize, there's a chance you won't get the size you're anticipating. <end>  Ring is Beautiful -- Sizing is ROTTEN  This is a beautiful ring and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. The problem is when I ordered it, it was a gift for my mom. She wears a size 9 and I ordered a size 9. She couldn't get it on. I was very disappointed -- to say the least. I know that it is a size 8 because it fits my ring finger on my right hand. I bought her a ring from a local jeweler to replace this one. The ring is beautiful but don't rely on the sizes. <end>  lovely  I have big hands, long fingers and ordered a size 9. It's a perfect fit. I think this is a really unique, showy ring that is very flattering to my large hands and I personally love it. The blue and green stones are not as vividly colored as shown but all in all still a great value for the money. <end>  Just beautiful!  I bought this as a birthday gift for myself with some other pieces to match a bracelet I bought last year. The ring is beautifully filigreed. The stones are much larger than I thought. Great for the price. As we say around here...two thumbs up! I just bought another one for everyday wear (because of silver with gold overlay I wanted one that I can keep in perfect shape for special events). I will report back on the everyday wear of this ring. <end>  disappointed  Simply said the ring fell apart after a month's time. Felt it was poor quality espcially after stones were lost. <end>  Very pretty but big and uncomfortable to wear  I was looking at this ring for quite awhile. When it went on sale, I finally bought it. When it arrived and I took it out of the box, I was very excited - it is beautiful and stones are bright and colorful. But when I tried it on, I was somewhat disappointed. It looks chunky, not feminine at all, although it was right size. I tried it on with the matching bracelet (from Kohls) and matching earrings (from amazon). The flower on the ring is so much bigger than the flowers on the bracelet and earrings. It does not look like a set (I was confident it would). In addition, it is rough on the sides and uncomfortable to wear. I have not decided yet if I am going to keep or return it. Will look at it again tomorrow. <end>  Well Worth the Money  the ring turned out to be exactly wat the picture shows and more. my gf totally loves it.. buy buy buy! <end>  stone missing  Regretfully, the first time I wore this ring was in December, which is beyond the return window. The first time I wore it, I looked down as I was leaving home & noticed there was a stone missing from the setting. The prongs on the ring were not pushed down very well on any of the settings. Once I noticed the missing stone, I adjusted all the other prongs. <end>  Multistone Jewelry Fans  This multistone ring is pretty and I bought it to complete my set. I already have a multistone bracelet, earrings and necklace. It looks fine alone, but when you compare it to other pieces of multistone jewelry, the stones are not as colorful as they appear in the picture. Maybe I just got one that wasn't as colorful because it was on sale. I'm not really sure if these are available as "seconds" or not. All I know is that the green and yellow stones are especially hard to see and the other stones shown are much lighter than they appear in this picture. I guess you really do get what you pay for! <end>  Surprising delight!  Like others have reported, the ring size was not accurate. I loved the look of this ring to match some earrings my husband bought me. I used a the old string guide to figure my size and contemplated not even ordering since the size i thought i needed was unavailable i was was sure I'd have to enlarge the size, but ordered it anyway and it fit perfectly! It is a large ring so if you have small hands, you might want to reconsider. It is really beautiful and the price amazing. As long as it holds up, what a deal. Probably not a ring to wear every day...only giving it 4 stars because of the inaccurate sizing. <end>
 B000NGJ3MM  Sterling Silver 3mm Blue Topaz Necklace, 18" ||	  A good gift for the value  I purchased this necklace as a gift. At the amount it is was discounted, I thought I would be getting the most amazing deal for the price. The necklace I recieved was as pictured, but the stones where smaller than I believed them to be.The necklace is pretty, delicate, and was still a nice gift. The stones are a very nice light blue color. However, the original price before discount was extremely overinflated. I would never in a million paid over $150 for this necklace. The necklace doesn't look expensive, and the links made them look moderately cheap. My price (about $30) was probably the correct value, disguised as a deep discount. <end>  Sparkly and pretty...  but when you put the necklace on, you can't even see either the sparkle, or the beauty of it. The stones are very small, which is expected. What is not expected is that the stones are linked by 3...(Meaning, 3 stones seem to be soldered together, then connected to 3 more stones, etc.) This made for an awkward appearance when worn since it's not "fluid." In other words, the necklace would "flip" constantly, and all you saw was silver and not the "topaz."I considered keeping it anyways because the price was great, the stones are sparkly and the color pretty, but the 18" wouldnt fit 3x around my wrist (2x made it too large) to be worn as a bracelet of some sorts.Unfortunately, this will have to go back. I wish it was better designed for more movement of each stone so that it laid better against the skin. <end>  Sterling silver blur topaz necklace  Poorly made, washed out stones. Cannot use for gifts because the quality is so terrible. Would have returned but missed return deadline due to travel. Stuck with them. <end>  Very pretty  I actually liked it very much and bought it in all three colors --peridot, amethyst and topaz. They very clearly state 3mm, hence I did not expect it to be big. The setting is more prominent than I would like but pretty all the same and seems secure. <end>
 B000NGJ3O0  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings ||	  I gave these as a gift she loved them  One of my best friends wanted these for her birthday. She got them and loved them. She said they looked just as nice in person as the picture shows. <end>  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings  The earrings are perfect. I've been wearing them every day since receiving them. Great and easy transaction. Very, very satisfied. Thank you. <end>  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings  Bought these recently when Amazon was running a special of $15.00 off on the price and free shipping...So I only paid $14.99 for these earrings. When I received them I was taken by how pretty they were, but couldn't figure out if they were white stones or blue! The blue topaz in these earrings was so light that they looked almost like white stones. In that I was disappointed, but in everything else very pleased. A value at $14.99 but I would not have paid $29.99 for these earrings with the poor stone color. Problem is  you don't know until you get them! <end>  Not blue, but very pretty  As others have mentioned, the color of the gems is a VERY pale blue, almost white. However, they are quite sparkly, and I actually think I wear them more than if they were a richer blue shade.I've received many compliments, and usually people think they are diamonds. For a very reasonable price (got them when Amazon ran the 14.99 special), these are a great value! <end>  Too Thick to Wear!  This was a case of you get what you pay for! The price was excellent but the stones are barely a blue color at all - not very pretty. Additionally, I am not able to wear them because the metal prong that is supposed to go through your ear is so thick (I don't wear earrings all the time, so the holes in my ears are not stretched out at all!) I was unable to get it through my ears! <end>  Not Blue Topaz...  I purchased these earrings for myself, and when they arrived I knew right away they did not look like blue topaz. They are a very pale blue, and look like aquamarine instead. Also, the posts are unusually wide, and are difficult, and somewhat painful, to insert in the ear if you're used to the more common thin posts. <end>  How did this get so many + reviews?!  I really am confused in why this item got so many positive reviews?! Perhaps I just got a dud?! Blue topaz is my birhtstone, and seeing the size of these, I thought these would be the perfect kind of earrings to put in and forget about....Mind you, I own many blue topaz pieces...but these were barely blue at all! And the silver pieces in between the stones? Well, it just blended the stones in even more to a washed out faded look! Seriously, I couldnt even tell these were blue topaz.Unfortunately, these went back. I wanted blue topaz, not some pale whitish stones... <end>  Everyday great value earrings!  I love this earring! The blue topaz is a lighter shade of blue, but it's pale with no cloudiness so it is very sparkly. The hoop size is very comfortable and the unique post/hinge/clasp is great, (no backings to lose!). I have to say it's great for that everyday goes with everything wearability. For the low price, you can't go wrong. (And even better if it's on special!!) <end>  Beware - Stones are very light blue = almost white in color  I bought these as a gift, and as someone else mentioned, they are not very blue at all. They almost look white. However, they are still beautiful earrings. She loved them! The clasp is a little strange. It took me a minute to figure out how to open them. It is not a traditional clasp for earrings. This may bother some people. I don't think I would like it but my gift recipient didn't seem to mind. <end>  beautiful earrings  I'm very happy with the look and quality of these earrings. The blue topaz stones are lighter in color than pictured, but still very nice. <end>
 B000NGJ3S6  Sterling Silver Simulated Diamond Lock-and-Key Pendant, 18" ||	  Really Disappointed.  The chain is so thin and flimsy, I'm afraid that if I wear it I'll lose it. I think that it might fall off of my neck. Years ago, I had a similar chain that did that, but I only paid about $6.00 or $7.00 for it. It was sterling silver, too. And, the whole necklace is so little and scarce. The way that it was made to look in the adverisement made me feel like I was really getting a good deal. Instead, I feel like I got taken. I thought that the chain would at least be thicker and stronger--I mean, for $30.00. If I could've seen the actual chain before buying it, I wouldn't have paid more than $10.00 for it. <end>  Perfect  I gave this to my 10 yr old granddaughter, she absolutely loves it. It is a perfect gift to gove <end>  sorry  i never get the item but was my fault i order to other adress sorry but i guess is a good product <end>  Girlfriend  My girlfriend absolutely loved this. She really isn't a jewelry person and is very hard to pick stuff out for but she wears this constantly. Its smaller than I imagined it but I think that is why she liked it so much. She has gotten a lot of compliments while wearing it.The chain did end up breaking but it was her fault and not really a product defect she took her shirt off while it was still on and the chain got caught on her shirt as she did that and snapped. Just bought a replacement chain and she is wearing it all the time again. <end>  It's cute but kinda small for me  I always wanted to buy a lock and key pendant necklace. Here I am expecting something else but it is not bad. It is cute but the chain did break after a week and I use my own. Would I recommend this, not really unless you are into small jewelry. <end>  Love it!  This necklace is one of my favorites. It's not large so it's a great size to wear all the time. I get lots of compliments on it and it's comfortable to wear. I'm very happy with this necklace. <end>  looks cheap  I bought this pendant because was nice in the picture and also had a 50% discount but in reality looks very cheap the chain is very thin and fragile... <end>  The best heart and key pendant set ever!!!!!!!  Absolutely one of the most beautiful little necklaces around. Get it and you will get lots of compliments on how nice it is. I was so happy that I purchased it.I had been looking for over three years for the perfect heart and key set, and this is it. Very nice weight and size and very expensive looking.Trust me if you get it or give it, you'll be pleased. <end>  Very unique and chic  I really like this necklace. It's very different and unique, and a popular style right now. It's made well and very pretty. I highly recommend it, especially for the great price! Comes in a nice little velvet bag. <end>  lovely  This is a beautiful little pendant. The chain is somewhat of a throw-away, but it was bought to go on something more substantial for my 10 year old niece. The bale does accomodate larger chains. The charm is small enough for a child, but large enough for an adult. She loved it and will enjoy it for a long time. <end>  Really pretty  I bought this for myself, and I really like it. The heart and key are very pretty, and as long as you keep it clean, there is a nice sparkle to it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the chain it comes with. It is very thin and easily tangles. I ended up ordering a new thicker chain for it, and now it's perfect. <end>  Cute, but kind of cheap looking  This is a cute little pendant from the front, but the backs of the key and lock aren't finished, so when they get turned around, which will ultimately happen since they're hanging on a chain, the not-so-pretty side will show. I'm satisfied with it for the price, though. I like the bale the charms hang from as it can be put on various sizes of chains. I plan to take the key and lock off and try them as earrings, too. <end>  My Best Friend Loved It!  I bought this for my best friend's birthday, who lives in Australia, and she just loved it. She liked it so much that she had her picture taken with it on just to show me via email. We have not been able to see each other in over 10 years and both of us are getting up in age (me in my 60s and her in her 70s), and I am so afraid I will never see her again so I wanted to give her something special to always remember me by. We are like sisters and I know she will always cherish this friendship necklace and think of me every time she looks at it. I don't think I could have given her anything else that she would have liked as much. Just wished it didn't take so long to ship something to Australia because she did not receive it until after her birthday even though I bought and had it shipped almost 3 weeks before her birthday. So my advice to you is if you buy this lovely friendship necklace and want it shipped over seas for a special occasion, have it shipped with at least a month a head of time. <end>  i love it  i gave this as a gift for my friend she love it. i like it so much that i am ordering another for me. looks beautiful well crafted.thank you so much. <end>  So Cute!!  I love this chain, it's not to big but def not small either, it's just Enough...Really Cute <end>  Easist way to appreciation yet  The charm is pretty small but for the price, it can't be beat. It had a very high 'you're sooooo sweet' to money ratio. Can't argue with that! <end>  Nice Piece but Very Small  it's probably my fault, but this is a very small pendant. sized more for a child than an adult. the chain is also very thin. there are many other pendants to choose from in this price range and I wish I chose one of them. <end>
 B000NGJ3T0  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Cross Pendant, 18" ||	  Nice Pendant!!!!  I gave it to my son's teacher last Christmas and she said she loved it!!!! It got a lot of compliments. Wished I bought one for myself ( <end>
 B000NGJ494  Sterling Silver Oval Cubic Zirconia Cocktail Ring, Size 9 ||	  Cocktail Ring  I was expecting a less than perfect ring for the price. To my amazement and joy.......it is FABULOUS! And HUGE! I am VERY pleased! <end>  Outrageous, but fun  This is faux jewelry at its finest. While no one is ever going to believe this is the "real thing," the workmanship is excellent. That is, the setting of the small cubics around the big stone (which is fabulously brilliant) is meticulously, and impeccably done. The small stones have great shine as well. The ring is marked 925 and China.The only thing that I should have paid more attention to are the dimensions because of my small, somewhat chubby, fingers. The dimensions, translated from metric, are  the length is a little over 1 inch, and the width is about 5/8 inch. If you have long, graceful, fingers, this would be perfect. On my finger, the ring reaches my first knuckle, but I love it anyway even though it is really too big for my hand. Within the past three weeks Amazon ran this ring for $8.75 (really did), including super saver shipping. <end>  Fantastic!  I love this ring. It is really large, but it looks much better in person than on the picture. It's high quality too. <end>  Perfect  I purchased this ring for my grandaughter who loves a lot of glitter and bling. This ring is perfect. It seems to be a good quality, is detailed, and looks like I paid more for it then I did. I know my grandaughter will love it.If you are looking for a large stone ring, this is it. I was looking for a large stone, and I was looking for something different with in a budget. She will be able to wear this ring for a long time, as it is made well, amd sterling silver.Also, it can be sized, since it is sterling silver.I am a happey shopper. <end>
 B000NGJ4B2  18k Gold Plated Sterling Silver Sapphire and Diamond-Accent Heart Pendant, 18" ||	  good  its a good pendant...nice chain but not as shiny as the picture leads you to believe nor is the sapphire as radiant, it's darker and the pendant may seem to be cheaply made. However, for $30 it's worth it as a nice birthday gift for a good friend or family member, but if you're looking for something more high end at a cheaper cost...look elsewhere <end>  My Aunt's 80th BD  I sent this to my Aunt in Ct for her 80th BD she loved it so much, she is my Hero her Son died in VN War and sence than she has fought sence than for ALL Miltery to be treated good and no one gone unsung!! <end>  Pendant  I loved the look of this pendant, but the chain that came with it is really disappointing. I put a Sterling Silver box chain on it and it has added a really nice look. I have had many complements on this already and I have only worn it for a week. <end>
 B000NGJ4BM  18k Gold Plated Ruby Flower Pendant and 3mm Stud Earring Set ||	  So good for the price  The earrings and pendant I received are smaller and not red as they appeared in the picture. The earrings are really tiny. But it's great for the price I brought, and I didn't expect. I really like the flower pendant. <end>  Perfect for a delicate neck, or a child...  I bought this during the 70% off sale, and am NOT disappointed. It is going to be a gift for my niece for her next birthday, and she is delicate, and turning 5 ... and I think these will look great on her (she has pierced ears). There is nothing wrong with the quality of the stones I got with these ... they are worth the money I spent alone. <end>  Little, but suits my 2yr old well  I bought this product for its unique shape and since it is a small pendant, it will not irritate my kid. I like this very much, and is worth the money if you have little ones. <end>  Good one  I and my wife (I bought this for her) liked this product. But she thought the earring is somewhat smaller. <end>  Red Ruby Pendant  This pendant looked much larger in the photo than when I received it so I was disappointed with the size when I received it. The earrings were dinky and not attractive at all. I sent the whole thing back, and of course only received a partial refund because it was not Amazon's fault that I ordered this and was dissatisfied. <end>  Small but Pretty  This is a really pretty set, the reds are deep, yet bright. Is very small, so kind of hard to see when wearing. But it works, and since I bought on discount, all the more better. <end>  It is way too small  It is very small. It good for kids maybe. The earrings are very very tiny, the necklace is a littler bigger. <end>  Nothing great!  Looks much better on the website!My 3yr old loved it when I gave it to her...so I didn't return.But now neither of us likes it  (It is really tiny and the ruby stones are not even tit-bit shiny. <end>  Love it!  Its so cute and it matches my christmas dress perfectly! It seems alot smaller in person though, and I wouldn't even bother with the earrings it would be better to go buy lesser quality larger ones than nicer quality teeny tiny ones. <end>  My daughter LOVED this necklace and earring set  I bought this set for my daughter's birthday. A necklace with earrings to match, she LOVED them both! It was the perfect gift. <end>  Not good as much as pic..  I bought this 4 ma girl friend's gift.I was certainly satisfied until I opened the box.It doesn't look like as picture.I expected red, but it's pink.. <end>  A good purchase from Amazon ..  I bought this for my wife and she was pleasantly delighted with the purchase. The necklace is actually small compared to the one as seen on the site. Anyways , it was a deal which we were nevertheless happy with. Would recommend as a gift. <end>  Beautiful Pendant  I bought this pendant as a gift for my niece. Well it's sufficient to say that I think It's the first time I see her wearing all the time something I've given her. I think she loves It. <end>
 B000NGKKHE  Sterling Silver Enamel Pink Baby Block Charm ||	  Well made  I bought this for a charm bracelet - my only complaint is that I wish the jump ring was on a corner instead of on the top of the cube, but otherwise I love it. <end>
 B000NGKKKQ  Sterling Silver Enamel Ice Skate Charm ||	  Beautiful charm  This charm is beautiful and unique because the top of the skate is open. Very cute! <end>
 B000NGKKRY  18k Gold Plated Sterling Silver Cross Pendant, 18" ||	  Great even after 2 years of wearing it  This is a great pendant, the color and the finish are the same as they were 2 years ago when i bought it. I was afraid that the gold on top of silver is going to fade or wear of but this is not the case with this pendant. <end>
 B000NGKKX8  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz 7-Stone Ring, Size 6 ||	  pretty ring with wrong stone color  I purchased this ring to go with my very pretty blue topaz earrings. The ring looks very nice, but the stone color is not like any of my blue topaz jewelry, more like a VERY light aquamarine, almost white! I am going to keep it anyway because it is a lovely ring and the price was right, but the picture is a misrepresentation, therefore only 3 stars. <end>  Looks Can Be Deceiving!  First of all, I was prepared for the ring to be a lighter shade of blue than that pictured. I was warned by several other reviewers that the shade is less than would be expected, AND they were right on the money. The stones in this ring are barely blue, and really not very pretty. It looks cheap and I would agree with one other reviewer who stated that it would have been better to have 5 slightly larger stones instead of the 7 smaller ones. It spans too far across the finger and the sizing does seem to be slightly smaller than the size stated. Save your money for something better. Even at half price, which is what I paid, it was not worth the money. <end>  Picture is not a good depiction  The color of the ring was not as pictured, hint of the palest blue. The sizing is a bit smaller than anticipated and it seems that the stone side is more flat instead of round. It probably would have been more flattering to have 5 stones and a more circular appearance.It still stacks and is not that bad for the price <end>   (  Day 3 of wearing this ring  One of the stones fell out and I don't know where it is!!!!!!!!!!! <end>  Ring review  cheap cheap cheaply made. and the stones are definately NOT blue, more like a dull gray <end>  Very pretty ring and well made...  ...the stones are a very light pale blue, almost clear looking in color in certain lights. I bought this for my daughter to stack with a cz one, a citrine and a peridot. Next to the cz it is hard to tell them apart at certain angles. However, they did a good job of matching up all the stones. The stones are NOT cloudy and are bright and sparkly. I believe a ring like this with clear AND richer blue color would cost A LOT more....so that is why I gave it a 4 star. At the sale price (and if you are not buying it for the specific color) it is a good value.Also, when the citrine ones were on sale I bought one and then ordered 2 more for gifts since the first one was so pretty. All three rings are different in size of stones and color. The larger the stones, the less color and clarity. I expected this because they are not simulated stones. It's a good idea to realize that when buying rings, etc., on-line. I prefer the smaller, more clear and colorful stone/rings, however, I am very happy with them all considering the price. <end>  Disappointed  I ordered the Blue Topaz 7-Stone Ring. I got a cubic zirconia type stone...It was NOT blue. I don't like the white stone and didn't order it. <end>
 B000NGKKZQ  Sterling Silver Amethyst 7-Stone Ring, Size 7 ||	  Not comfortable to wear  First, the color of the stones is lighter than is pictured. I realize it is hard to capture color in a picture, but the ring I received has stones that are light purple to almost a pink color. For the price of the ring I can deal with that though, I mean, what can you expect for $29? The worst part is that it's just hard to wear because it's not comfortable. It would have been better with five stones instead of seven because the two outer stones rub against your other fingers and it gets annoying fast. I'll be returning this ring and will try something else. <end>  Nice ring, very pale color  The color of the stones is a lot lighter than in the picture. However, it is still a very nice ring, so I am going to keep it anyway. At 40% off, it was inexpensive enough, and it goes with the equally pale stones in the matching earrings... <end>  sterling silver amethyst ring  arrived earlier than stated date, stones a little lighter in color than i like best, but it is a nice addition to my amethyst collection. i will definately purchase from this seller again. <end>  7 stone ring  it is very nice the only problem with it is that the stones hurt my fingers. they are too separated. <end>  not happy with  When I received this ring, I put it aside because I was very ill at the timewhen I did look at it, it was past the time to return it. In the picture it looksround, but when i received it, it is more square than round. it justlooks odd and now I have a ring that is ugly and no one wants it. <end>
 B000NGKLUK  Sterling Silver Round Cubic Zirconia Cocktail Ring, Size 9 ||	  Great product and service  I ordered this ring for my 23 year daughter the Monday before a Saturday Christmas. I was unwilling to bump for faster shipping to ensure Christmas delivery - so image my surprise when the ring arrived before Christmas. My daughter absolutely loves the ring. She normally buys her rings in size 6 but this particular style was sold out in all sizes except size 5. I went ahead and ordered the 5 and it fits perfect. She loves that this ring allows her ring finger to set tight against her pinky and middle finger without gaps. It has plenty of bling which she loves and yet it doesn't seem to catch or snag clothing. Very pleased with this company - their shipping speed and product. Will look to do business with them again. <end>  cheap looking ring  This ring looks like a glass ring, very basic and my normal size did not fit. Order one size up <end>
 B000NGL1AO  Magnificient Arrow Head Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Necklace ||	  Great  I loved the arrowhead. The only problem is I need a bigger chain. It is for my husband for our 25th anniversary. I am still looking though. Thanks a lot. <end>
 B000NGMNCY  Sterling Silver Epoxy High Heel Shoe Charm ||	  CUTE AND SMALL  I GAVE 2 STARS BECAUSE I BOUGHT THIS FOR AN ADULT CHARM BRACELET AND THIS IS TINY LIKE FOR A CHILD CHARM... IT IS VERY CUTE AND WELL MADE, SHINEY, AND THE COLOR IS A SOFT PINK (CUTE) <end>
 B000NGMNL0  Sterling Silver Wishbone Pendant, 18" ||	  Pendant Wishbone 18&#34;  I love this necklace. It is fun to wear and I receive many compliments on it. Would highlyrecommend this. It appears to be of good quality. <end>  Totally worth the money!  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and was a little leary of it being so inexpensive ($15 at the time). Wow, totally worth getting. Yes, the chain is a bit &#34;fine&#34; but the weight of the pendant totally makes up for it!! Well made, nice heft and looks gorgeous on!! <end>  perfect choice  Love Love Love this wishbone pendant. Great quality. Dainty and stylish. Great packaging -- a nice blue velvet pouch and blue box. Bought it as a gift but really wanted to keep it for myself. Super happy with the purchase. <end>  beautiful necklace  The necklace is pretty. The wishbone charm is not too big. and it looks very dainty. But the chain isn't ral strong. <end>  Good for teenagers or younger  The product was not packaged well.It was just thrown in a ring box, so over the coarse of shipping, it became very, very tangled.I was able to get all but one knot out. It definitely should have come packaged like necklaces usually do with some sort of backing/stand so that it wouldn't tangle during shipment.Also, it has a very cheap chain. It's what you would expect for the price I paid, but I did expect better from the Amazon Curated Collection. <end>  Christmas Gift  My daughter loved this necklace. I thought that the 18&#34; chain would be to long but it was the perfect length. <end>  Wishbone hanger way bigger than Dogeared  It was advertised very sneaky, right between all the dogeared products. I thought it was Dogeared as well. The wishbone is too big - you can't tell from the picture. <end>  Not sterling silver!  *UPDATED REVIEW*When I initially reviewed this necklace, I was misunderstanding things a bit. The packaging of this necklace said the product was rhodium plated and I assumed I was paying for a piece of jewelry that potentially wasn't sterling silver. What I didn't know was that rhodium-plating is actually used on stuff like sterling silver, white gold and platinum because it adds brightness, shine and resistance to tarnish! Which is an added bonus, but it might be something to consider adding to the product description as a potential selling point so people who don't do their research don't make fools of themselves.  )This necklace is very beautiful and the person I got it for loved it! <end>  Disappointed in quality of chain.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the chain. Pendant is very nice. Will think again prior to buying jewelry online. <end>  Marginal  I bought this for myself when it was on sale. It did not meet my expectations - much less 'elegant' than it looked in the photo. <end>  Reviews misleading  I just received the necklace in a padded envelope........very different from the video review by Christine. Not sure of the quality yet. It is a gift. I will let you know. <end>  Excellent purchase  This is a very well made product for the price. It's quite attractive. I purchased as a gift and was very pleased. Awesome price, I will be returning to purchase more as gifts. <end>  great gift item  great for the preteen or teenager in your family....found the item just a bit small though...would liked 25% larger <end>  Really to small  really to small I was expecting something better they need to have sort it probably for age this, can be good for a teenager <end>  Lovely  I bought this for me - something I do not usually do, but the price was right and I liked the video review.Shipping - Packing;Mine did not come in a great big shipping box as the video review. The chain WAS tangled, it was not secured in its bag or the product box in any way. I did have to untangle it. I would give packing - 1 star  (Shipment;Shipment was fast. I was notified via email and text. Came before estimated time.The Necklace/Pendant itself;I actually thought the Wishbone would be a little bigger in size. To me, It seems kinda tiny. I should have looked (better) at the picture a fellow reviewer posted of the wishbone next to the quarter. I still would have bought it but wouldnt have been surprised at size. The pendant is pretty overall.The necklace is not the best. It is delicate, its cheap, but hey, this set up only cost 14.00 so Im not complaining.I am going to buy a different chain so I wont loose the Wishbone.I do like it though. I expected less for 14.00 so I am happy. It is pretty.I recommend it. <end>  Daughter loved it!  I bought it for my daughter, she loved it! So much so that she had previously purchased one for herself. Now she has two, she declined to exchange it for anything else. <end>  Very Nice  Simple, nice sized, looks the same on both front and back and lays well. I understand it is sold out, when/if it comes back, grab it! <end>  Beautiful  This was a gift and they loved it! Great gift idea, and the chain is the right size for the pendant. <end>  good choice  It was on my daughter's Christmas list, and out of a ton of choice, I picked this one. She's thrilled with it & I like the way it looks, too. <end>  Nice Gift  Item was bought as a gift, a little on the small size but very nice, I would recommend this item <end>  Great necklace  I love this necklace. The pendant is the perfect size, not too big and not too little. I wear it all the time and have gotten numerous compliments. <end>  Simple and beautiful  I love how simple and yet how pretty this pendant is. I've received a lot of compliments on it.  -) <end>  Beautiful as described, tangle-y chain  I love this necklace, it is really beautiful and worth the low price.My only negative to report is that the chain is very prone to tangle, especially if you sleep with the necklace on  ) Also, those pashmina scarves that are all the rage should not be worn with this chain-for some reason it ALWAYS nicks my scarf and puts a small "run" in the scarf.Finally, the wishbone is just a little bigger than I expected, but looks good anyway!  ) <end>  Wife loves it  Bought this for my wife for Xmas. She really liked it. It is good quality. <end>  Very pretty  I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I was quite suprised. The pendant is the perfect size and very shiny. The chain is extremely delicate looking but actually quite sturdy. I have been wearing the necklace all the time (to bed, in the shower) and it is holding up nicely. I have already recieved a ton of compliments on it.The only negative - made in China. <end>  Pretty little necklace  This necklace is so cute and pretty. I got it for my sister for Christmas, and she loves it. I might buy it for myself. <end>  Looks just like the picture!  Yes, the chain was a little tangled when I got it, but I've been wearing it for weeks now and have found it to be very durable. The wishbone is very pretty and unique. It is as pretty as it is in the picture, perfectly shaped and shiny. I'm very pleased with this purchase. It was specially priced as a lightning deal before Christmas. I bought it to give as a gift, and after seeing it, kept it for myself! <end>  loved it  It was even better than I expected. The wishbone looked high quality although the chain was a bit delicate. <end>  Love this necklace!  I love this necklace. Plus, I get tons of compliments! The chain is a little bit flimsy, and doesn't travel very well in the pouch, but other than that I love it! <end>  Love it!  I bought this for myself as a birthday present a couple months ago and I absolutely love it. It is unique and different but so pretty. I am actually wearing it right now! I would highly recommend this neckalace! It is the perfect length as well, it sits right inbetween your neck and your chest not too far down or up! <end>  Cute Charm - Good Chain  I have had this necklace for almost a month now. The charm is very cute and a decent size. I have not had any problems with the chain, and it seems better than many of the other chains I own. I have worn this necklace almost every day since I purchased it, and I have yet to get my hair caught or wrapped around the chain like so many other necklaces. I am very happy with this purchase! <end>  Tons of Compliments  I love this Wishbone pendant and I decided to get it although I don't wear a lot of necklaces cause they usually break on me. But I decided to get this because it was inexpensive so if it broke then it wouldn't be a big deal but this has turned into one of my favorite pieces of jewelry. I get so many compliments on it and although it is not super unique it is not your typical heart, butterfly or cross necklace. <end>  Simple and lovely  I bought this necklace after seeing a similar one in a movie. It is really lovely. The necklace and pendant look delicate but are very sturdy. I have owned it for about a year and wear it almost everyday. It is still in perfect condition without any tarnish, and on the original chain. The pendant is about an inch long and a half an inch wide. People frequently compliment me on this simple little necklace. I highly recommend it! <end>  Pretty necklace, great price  I purchased this after watching video review which really goes into detail about the necklace (and I recommend) . I was concerned about the chain breaking, as some reviews mentioned how delicate it was, but I have had it for over month and worn it almost every day - no problems. I would recommend this necklace to anyone. <end>  elegant  As said by other reviewers, the pendant is very elegant, the length is quite satisfactory too. My wife loves it a lot -- especially after I told her Jennifer Aniston wore one in the show. <end>  LOVE!  Love this necklace! It looks beautiful on and is a perfect size -- I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for the perfect everyday necklace. <end>  Beautiful for the price!  Great buy for the price! The chain is delicate and the wishbone itself is beautiful. Also, the wishbone is stamped "925" (sterling silver). <end>  Cheap Chain  Beautiful necklace but the chain is very cheap and not at all durable. I've only had the necklace a week and the chain has broken so I will have to put the charm on a new one. <end>  Whisbone pendant  I saw a similar chain in a movie and really liked the look. The pendant is pretty, just a little larger than I though it would be. I wanted small and dainty (about a dime size in length) and this ended up being about a nickel size in length. Still a nice look and I can wear alone or as a layering chain. <end>  she loves it  My wife got this on valentines day and loves it, She wears it quite often and says she gets many compliments on it. <end>  Still haven't recieved this necklace!  Dispite paying EXTRA money for two day shipping, It is almost a week after my order and I STILL have not recieved this necklace. I also have not gotten any sort of response from the emails I have written the seller. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I'm starting to think that I paid for something that I am never actually going to have sent to me. <end>  Awesome  This was better than expected! Both the chain and the pendant were beautiful and perfect in size! Just amazing and the length of the chain was perfect too. <end>  Classic and Unique  I love this necklace! it arrived a few days ago and I couldn't wait to open it. I didn't think it would looked nice when I purchased it. When I opened it I was blown away the picture doesn't explain how beautiful this necklace looks. Its Unique and not original and that is the reason why I bought it because I didn't want a necklace that has a heart or anything original. I don't regret getting this and I recommend it to anyone that wants a necklace that is unique and classic. <end>  Really Cute - Possibly Plated  This pendant is very shiny, dainty, and looks much more expensive than it really was. The inside of the wishbone is stamped with "S 925 CHINA" and the chain clasp is stamped "925 ITALY." I question if this is plated because on the plastic bag, the description about the bar code says "PLTD"...which of course stands for plated. I'm not quite sure which part of this it could refer to. At any rate, it's very nice charm and chain, and looks great! <end>  nice product  excellent small pendant. I got this for a gift and should have bought more because they are so useful in that sense. A smart buy. <end>  Pretty  First time ordering any jewelry item from Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised. The wishbone is approx. 1" in length. The charm is stamped with ".925 China." The charm itself is a quality weight and not likely to break. The 18" chain was pretty flimsy though (I didn't want 18" anyways, thus changed out the chain.) <end>  Already bought two!  I got this for my little sister as a side-gift for her birthday! She loved it and I loved it so much I went back and got one myself. It's delicate but substantial and very pretty. I can't wait to wear mine  ) <end>  Lovely Necklace  This necklace was a Christmas present to myself. The pendant is substantial in size, although I wish it was a bit smaller. The chain is nice and the perfect length. All in all I've been very happy but as stated was hoping the charm was a bit smaller, more delicate. <end>  Beautiful pendant - fragile chain  I purchased this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas and she was very happy. It is a very pretty piece of silver jewelry, however the chain is very dainty and delicate and knots too easily. I replaced the chain withROLO1MM-16 Nickel Free Italian Silver 1.5mm Rolo Sturdy Chain Necklace 16".All in all I am pleased with this purchase. <end>  nice charm  The charm is nice but the chain it came on is terrible. Just throw it out and buy yourself a decent silver chain. The charm itself was worth the price though. <end>  Simply Beautiful  I bought 3...one for my mom, sister and myself. We love them! Simple, different and beautiful! Arrived in perfect condition and very fast as usual! <end>  Very Pleased  I'm very pleased with this product. I've seen it advertised elsewhere for alot more money, so when I received it today I was anxious to see what it would look like. I must admit it is fantastic, the length of the chain is just right and the wishbone itself has a very high polish. I put it on right away. If anyone out there is on the fence don't wait. It's worth every penny. <end>  wishbone necklace  Very cute necklace - I got one for each of my daughters for special events that they were participating in and they both loved them. <end>  Good buy!  I bought a few of these as a cheaper bridesmaids gift because I got them numerous things. It is very lightweight and cute. I do not like the "made in China" on the inside of the wishbone, it is a bit tacky. But you get what you pay for. Overall a good purchase for the price. <end>  Love it...  I love this Wishbone necklace. I saw one day while scrolling through looking for vacation jewelry, but it has become a member of my frequent rotation. I get so many compliments on it, and everyone is amazed it was only $13. The chain is dainty, but I think it allows the pendant to be the feature. <end>  very shinny  I've worn it in the pool, in the lake, in the shower - this necklace stays shinny and like new. i really like it. And I've gotten lots of comments on it since it's unusual. Not like a heart or a star. It stands out. <end>  Nice  The silver charm is really sturdy, but the chain is a tad weak. And I bought this for my best friend shes kinda petite, so the chain did hang a little too low for our tastes, but just read the measurements on it to make sure youre happy with it. <end>  better than expected!  good quality, looks great! i was really happy to find that the necklace was as described! very pleased and would recmd!! <end>  Simple and Nice design - The chain is very dainty  I got this for a friend, and I'm sure she'll love it. Although the chain is very, very dainty - The pendant hole is large enough where she could opt for a larger necklace if she chooses. So that's nice.It's very pretty necklace. Well worth the money! <end>  Love it.!  Beautiful Quality, I understand this is not Platinum or anything super expensive ... But it really looks like a real one.... I am in love with this.... no doubt... The length of the chain is perfect the finish of the pendant is delightful ....Glad i made this purchase..! <end>  Really Cute!  I wear this pendant most of the time and I always get compliments on it! I had to get a different chain for it because the one it came with was no good. I wear it in the shower and have no issues with it getting dull, it is a shiny and pretty as the day I got it!If you are on the fence about this, its time to jump to the &#34;buy&#34; side because it really is adorable! <end>  My wife loves it  My wife lost her old wishbone pendant necklace so I got her this one as a surprise gift. It's definitely more solid/bigger than her last one which was very small and thin. But, she really does like it so I'm happy. <end>  love it!  love this necklace it is exactly what i was hoping for. it is very sturdy i wear it all the time!! haven't had any problems. <end>  Cute little purchase.  I love this necklace. Very cute and simple. I highly reccommend if you are looking for something small and cute. <end>  not actual sized  i would not recommend this product. the wishbone is much smaller than the website picture would have you believe. in addition, the chain is very thin but i guess appropriate for the price of 16.00 dollars. still i was unimpressed of this product. <end>  Necklace  Was in great condition, It came in jewlery box and was in perfect condition. Gave to my sister and she loved it. <end>  Wishbone charm very attractive  The wishbone charm itself is very nice and looks great on a different necklace. The necklace that came with the wishbone seems flimsy and not very attractive. Once the wishbone was put on a more substantial chain, I was very happy with the purchase. <end>  Elegant  Beautiful packaging. The chain looks delicate but has been very sturdy. Have accidentally worn sleeping and in shower, and has survived. Wear this almost daily since purchase in November. The wishbone is a good size and very shiny. I purchased a few for as gifts also and they were well received. <end>  Beautiful  The pendant was perfect. She loved it. It is exactly what she wanted. I don't like being required to write these with a certain amount of words. That is what makes me not even give a review. <end>  Christmas gift  My granddaughter like it. She wore it to school and everyone thought it was really pretty and nice to get jewerly <end>  very nice  I wish the chain is longer and better quality . However it is good for the money we paid .Thank you so much <end>  Pretty Wishbone Necklace  This is the wishbone necklace I've been looking for. It's not too big or too small, just the right size. And the necklace is the right length for me at 18 inches. This necklace goes with all my casual wear. <end>  Buy it!  This necklace came in a week, and the necklace part wasn't twisted or knotted like i expected from the other reviews. The first day I wore it, people commented on how cute it was. I would definitely recommend the wishbone necklace! <end>  Cute Pendant  This is a really nice necklace, especially for the price. Think it's one of the best buys I'v made in a while <end>  Dainty and simple  My bff and I turned 30 this year and I gifted this for she and I. Hers coupled with a matchbox musicbox that played happy birthday. She loved them both to say the least! It is a very simple chain, quite thin but I like that it's very feminine, not to mention affordable as well! The wishbone is exactly as pictured, simple but can also be elegant. We are pleased with this product. <end>  Love this necklace  This is a really nice little silver necklace. It is so cute! I've been wearing it non-stop since I received it. It hasn't tarnished at all, is comfortable, and my infant son loves to grab it! <end>  Broken Chain  Love the wishbone, thankfully I wanted to put it on a chain I already owned because it arrived with a broken chain!! Its larger than I had thought but still very nice. <end>  just the right size  I got this as a gift and i love it! Chain and wishbone are just the right size, and of good quality. Def a good buy. =) <end>  nice gift  Got this as a birthday gift for a friend. The quality is very good and doesnt feel cheap, the wishbone has a nice feel. Would highly recommend this to anyone! <end>  Beautiful! And very quality!  I ordered this necklace with a few other bridesmaids as a surprise to our bride who wants a wishbone theme! It's beautiful, well crafted, and perfect for what we wanted. Very happy with this order and she's going to be surprised!  ) <end>  Great Item!  It looks exactly like the picture. You get what you see and at a great price. My baby pulls on the chain all the time and it still hasn't broke. Great Item! <end>  Larger than I thought  Perfect as described and wrapped nicely. I thought it would be smaller or at least with more shape. It looks like I'm wearing a large upside down v.  / <end>  Love  Recieved sooner than expected. Packed securely, and presented in a box. The necklace is sturdy. I find myself wearing it daily. <end>  waiting for the compliments...  bought it for my best friend's b'day....i hope she at least like it..cause i absolutely love it..!and i thank amazon for such a great service..A recommended buy..! great value for price.. <end>  Loved it!  This is the perfect accesory for the thanksgiving season! It's so festive. And the quality is great. I thought the chain was fine even though other reviews said it was too think. Great necklace and great price. <end>  Wishbone pendant = awesome  great item. Exactly what I wanted, and it sits on my neck perfectly. I've already gotten compliments on it =) Very happy! Thanks! <end>  This necklace with wishbone pendant is beautiful!!  For the low price, I wasn't expecting much from this necklace with wishbone pendant, but I was wrong. It's beautiful!! The necklace itself is dainty and lovely. The wishbone pendant is well constructed and the perfect size, not to big and gaudy! I also love the price of this item. I plan to buy a couple more to give as holiday gifts. <end>  Wishboen Pendant  Love the wishbone pendant! It is huge. It was much bigger than I anticipated. It was a great buy. I'm enjoying it and have had many compliments on it. <end>  Wishbone Pendant  Ordered this pendant as I had one when younger and lost it. Quality is very good and at a good price. <end>  Great Pendant Necklace  My wife has sensitive skin, so jewelry metals other than sterling silver and gold cause her to break out in a rash. This pendant necklace is sterling silver so she had no problems. She loves it and has been wearing it for days! <end>  looks good  Chinese!!!!! OMG!!!! I couldn't believe it when I saw it...light and looks nice, I wear it all the time and keeps the shiny look <end>  Nice  The wishbone is pretty big, so pay attention to the size, but other than that it is very nice. The chain is very thin and tangles easily. I would recommend a colored cord instead of the chain for both practical and aesthetic reasons. <end>  Great gift for a friend or yourself!  I got this necklace for a friend and was very happy with it. The pendant is a good size (not too big and not too small) and the chain seems strong to last. I liked it so much I got one for myself. It goes with pretty much anything. <end>  Perfect  I saw something similar in a magazine. This is nice and delicate. It was also a great price. Perfect to wear with anything. <end>  Loved it!  I got this as a 30th birthday gift for my best friend since she was feeling down about turnign 30. I told her it was so she can make a wish every day she wears it and that the next 30 years are going to be when all her wishes come true. She loves the necklace and says that she has received numerous compliments on it in teh last couple of days. <end>  Beautifull  Omg I love this so much way better in person.The packaging is top notch and comes with a really nice box and a pouch.I havent had any problems with this at all like some of the other comments.The chain is nice.I used to be an E--Y Shopperbut amazon has won me over they are so great they have every thing.Shipping is fast I seem to always get my Items before they say I will thats a plus.Thanks amazon.You keep up the good work and Ill keep buying. <end>  Can't beat it for the price  Bought two of these for my 30 something nieces. They came right out of the bag/box and onto their necks on Christmas day. I have read reviews about the chain tangling and although it is a delicate chain, I think that is mostly going to be about how to store it. It is a lovely little necklace. <end>  it's ok  chain is flimsy and knots very easily, wishbone portion is clunky and hollow, larger than what i expected but should have expected for the price. <end>  Make a wish  I bought this as a gift for my niece and like it so much, I'm ordering one for myself .... Fun to wear and you can't beat the price - well made - makes a great gift for a teen girl or the young at heart! <end>  beautiful and at a great price!  I loved it. I had been eyeing it for about a year. I bought it for myself when the price dropped from the original $25 to about $15. I just couldn't resist. I have not stopped wearing this necklace for the past two weeks. <end>  Wishbone necklace  This looks exactly as pictured..the 18&#34; chain that comes with it is a bit short for my taste, so I bought the Leather Cord Chain Sterling Silver Necklace 20&#34; Long and it will look great with it. <end>  Just in time for Thanksgiving  I find this necklace to be simply elegant and it gives my neckline that little oomph. I wear it with open-necked, button-down shirts and find the length to be perfect for such. A great buy for $17.77 and, even better, it hasn't turned my skin green. Perfect to wear at Thanksgiving. <end>  Nice pendant, wimpy chain  I think I waited about 3 weeks to get this necklace, and I was excited when I received it. However, on the 2nd day of wearing it, the chain broke, so now I have to purchase a new chain for it. The pendant is too heavy for the chain, so I suggest for amazon to upgrade the chain or stop selling this item with a wimpy chain. <end>  great deal!  ordered this as a gift but had it sent to myself so i could check it out first adn it is beautiful. the wishbone is heavy and substanstial for a pendant, the chain leaves something to be desired-its thin and doesnt match the weight of the pendant. But i am very pleased with it and recommend it to anyone who is thinking about ordering it. <end>  Popped the first day I wore it  I didn't even have it on for an hour and the chained popped. All I did was get into the car! <end>  What I wish about my wishbone  The wishbone pendant is what I thought it would be, but the clasp on the chain is so tiny I can't get it to work. So now I just wish I could wear my wishbone, but I can't. <end>  Made in China  I love the necklace. But if you are giving it as a gift, beware of the MADE IN CHINA inscribed on the inner side of it. I realize most people won't notice it while you are wearing it, but it is pretty large and noticeable. Otherwise the necklace is cute. <end>  Cute but very lightweight  This is a cute necklace but the wishbone is extremly lightweight. I thought it would be a little heavier than it is. I would like it so much more if it was a little heavier. It feels more like a little girl's necklace rather than an adults. <end>  Great for its price  For $15, it is a great deal. The pendant is shiny, but not fake looking. The chain is light and very feminine. The wishbone itself though, is pretty big and thick. I would not recommend this for a petite girl as the pendant might be a bit overwhelming. It does, however, make a hollow sound, and since it's pretty light, I assume it is hollow. Overall it's definitely a great everyday accessory, and at $15, definitely worth it! <end>  Nice item for a gift  I liked this item online and gifted it to my wife. She really liked it and I was also quite pleased seeing it on her neck. The wishbone is little larger than a dime and very shinny. Its just the right size on neck. <end>  Can pass for Tiffany quality  The quality of the pendent is much much better than what the price might suggest. My friend and I both got one and agree that it can easily pass for Tiffany quality. The necklace comes in a soft navy blue pouch inside a navy blue box. There was some tangling of the chain but easily untangled. The wishbone itself is about 1/3cm thick so it doesn't look like a cheap flimsy thing, although it was a little odd that the chain was made in Italy and the pendant was made in China but that really didn't affect how great it looks. <end>  Amazing buy!  Length   2 35 MinsMy review of the Sterling Silver Wishbone pendant on the 18 inch chain! I absolutely love it! <end>  Great Gift  I gave this to my fiance for an Easter basket gift this year. I remembered her telling me that she loved Jennifer Aniston's necklace (which is a wishbone one, but about $6,000 more expensive than this). So I got her this one.It's very pretty, and she's gotten non-stop compliments on it. And she looks beautiful in it! <end>  great little purchase  this pendant is great! very cute, it was just as described and the price was completely reasonable. <end>  Cute  Chain came a tangled mess, and continued to tangle every time it touched itselfThe sterling silver was really very pretty, and the necklace looked really niceIf only the chain wasn't such a painIts INCREDIBLY thin and gets caught up in itself like no otherand the fine-ness makes it hard to unknot <end>  Very delicate and pretty, but sturdy!  This is a really pretty necklace, and is seriously trendy! I am pretty hard on my jewelry - I often sleep in my pendants accidentally and have broken more than one. This pendant takes a beating, but the chain is still delicate and pretty.This is definitely a necklace that will get you noticed! <end>  Love it!!!  This wishbone necklace is even more beautiful than the picture.My friend recently bought one in New York and I've wanted one since I saw it. Originally, I was a little concerned about the quality of the product since the price was so low, but when I received it, I was thrilled. It's better looking than the one from New York...and for way less money! <end>  Pretty Little Thing  I've always loved the Dogeared wishbone necklace, and have wanted to own it pretty much since I first saw it. I saw it again in He's Just Not that Into You. However, this necklace cost about 5 times less than the Dogeared one, and about 300 times less than Jennifer Aniston's.My order arrived on time, and it looks exactly like the image. Its a beautiful little necklace. Just note that if you're looking for a Dogeared replica, this isn't it - this wishbone is slightly thicker. Like a few said before me, it arrived with the necklace entangled, but took less than 2 minutes to straighten out. All in all, its a really gorgeous piece, and definitely worth the price. <end>  Good choice  The chain is a little flimsy, but all in all, a very nice necklace. I have had no problems so far and thought the price was a great deal for this sterling silver piece. I was very satisfied. <end>  AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!!  My daughters and I have begun the "Wishbone Sisterhood" within our circle of friends and family...this has become a very special symbol for all of us. I ordered five previously and am now ordering more. Compliments abound all the time about this...everyone loves it and wants to know where they can get one.Start your own sisterhood -- because dreams DO come true! <end>  wishbone  The necklace arrived very quickly and it was just as described however the chain was heavily knotted which was a pain to undo. Otherwise, nice item. <end>  Very nice  This necklace is better than described. It has a beautiful patina, smooth, rich, shiny finish, and a very pretty delicate chain. It looks like a necklace from an expensive jewelry store, yet is very affordable. Very pleased! <end>  Nice for the price  Cute pendant. Chain is a little thin, but overall for 20 bucks, it will make my grandma very happy. <end>  Absolutely Wonderful Pendant  I finally ordered this pendant after keeping it bookmarked for months. I am very satisfied with it. I receive lots of compliments on it, it is simple yet elegant and very noticeable. It has a lovely size, proportional without being gaudy. The chain is thin, of course, but accents the pendant nicely. Overall, a perfect look for a young woman. <end>  so cute  This necklace arrived quickly and just how it appears online. It has a clean and simple design but definitely stands out - I've gotten many compliments on it! <end>  Almost bought it...  I was going to purchase this until I watched the video which reveals a "Made in China" stamp on the inside of one of the wishbone arms. That is pretty tacky! <end>  Cute pendant, lousy chain  The pendant is lovely. Just the right size and very lightweight. However, after wearing it for less than a day, the chain broke. It wasn't even caught on anything, it just snapped on its own. I suppose I shouldn't have expected much for such a cheap necklace, but I was still disappointed that it didn't even last a full day. <end>  I Like This Necklace!  I was happy to receive this item and had been looking for a solid, sterling silver wishbone pendant for some time! It came in a small pouch and secure packaging and the necklace chain was in tact. I did not really care for the chain, but that was not the main concern about this necklace. I simply put the nice pendant on a box chain and works good for me! <end>  Great Neckless  This is a great product. Very nice looking for a low price. I love this neckless! <end>  SS Wishbone Pendant  Pendant is quality and as depicted in photos & description, 18&#34; chain is not - too frail for use with pendant. <end>  Looks pretty after you take 30 min to detangle it  The necklace looks just like in the picture, I just wish they would packaged it properly (not in a velvet bag) that it doesn't tangle up like it did. It took me quiet a while to detangle it... I was so frustrated at one point that I almost sent it back. Because the chain is so delicate it takes a while to detangle. <end>  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS  WE WERE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS BUT TO BE HONEST I AM ABSOLUTELY SATISFIED 100++%. BEAUTIFUL QUALITY ITEM FOR EXTRAORDINARILY LOW PRICE. I JUST ORDER TWO MORE. <end>  Very nick looking  The chain was tangled but easy to straighten. Good quality. Looks very nice on and would recommend it to others <end>  Perfect!  I constantly get complements and questions while wearing this necklace. Loved it so much I bought one for my sister-in-law as a gift! <end>  Delicate and Sweet  I love the idea behind the wishbone and bought two of these for my nieces. They are a little young to handle such a delicate chain but in a couple of years, these will be perfect. <end>  Friends love it, too  I wear this necklace pretty much every day. So many people have asked where I've purchased this, and I've received many compliments. Chain is a little delicate, but so far it's held up. <end>  Great Gift Item  Bought this as a Christmas gift; so recipient hasn't gotten yet; but am sure she will love. The chain is thin; but the pendant looks substantial and the perfect size. <end>  Buy this  Cool fish! Awesome, she loved it! These are my additional fourteen words.I like the word blurg and food because they are good <end>  Beautiful  Great size and quality, bought them as gifts and for myself. First spotted on Jennifer Anniston and had to have one. <end>  very nice  This is a very nice pendant. The chain is the perfect length, and I love the size of this charm. <end>  Great Value  I was impressed with the quality of this necklace. Love it. Compared to other jewelry at this price this was an excellent deal. <end>  Awesome quality  I've had this necklace in my wish list for awhile and I was so happy when I received it for Christmas yesterday. It is even better in person. It's very nice quality, the chain is delicate and lovely and the medium sized wishbone feels solid. I couldn't be happier! <end>  pretty!  For the price you can't beat this necklace. I am used to something a little weightier and only wear sterling which this is supposed to be, but it feels hollow and less substantial than my other sterling necklaces. For the money I am not complaining . It is not as skimpy as the Dogeared version and has more substance than that one but no heft. Feels hollow on the inside and is stamped "China" in a discreet place inside one shank of the wishbone..wished it was Italy or Mexico as the snob in me wasn't crazy about that, but it is very lovely and shiny and hangs well on the chain. It wasn't tangled at all - in fact I really like the chain and though I usually wear a 16" as longer chains tend to look sloppy on me, in this case I think the 18" drop shows off the wishbone best and looks so classy on. Also the chain appears to be fairly well made, not as flimsy as I expected in reading the reviews. It is everything I like in a necklace - minimal but eyecatching and classy and certainly looks like it cost more. Good gift for a girl or woman of any age, and I think it would make a lovely bridesmaid or holiday gift! You can always change out the chain to customize the length, and I will even try to pair it with a skinny leather cord, changing it up a little more. It looks absolutely lovely the way it drapes when worn. Uncommonly good for the price. <end>  Perfect every day accessory  I love this wishbone pendant - just the right size, light but solid. The chain is very thin and is the right length for my decolletage. However, the chain has nickel in it as it causes a rash on my neck if I wear it for too many days in a row. If I didn't have a nickel allergy, I would wear it more often as it is perfect as an every day accessory. <end>  Wow what a find  My first Amazon order and I ordered this necklace from the great reviews. Looked all over for it but decided to go through amazon.It was better than expected. Will use Amazon again. <end>  durable  well i was looking for a neclace that my young boys would not be able to pull at and break so easy. This neclace has held up and is still shiny and beautiful. <end>  shiny and simple  This necklace is very cute and simple. It's very shiny and delicately made for its price. The chain is longer and thinner than I had expected, but I haven't gotten an issue with the tangling. The whishbone pendent is a bit bigger than I had expected. Got a compliment from a victoria's secret saleslady the other day. Comes with a little dark blue velvet pouch and box. Great for gifts. <end>  LOVE This Pendant!!!!!  This by far one of my favorite pendants to wear and I get soooooooo many compliments on it. I wanted something different than the normal star, heart, or cross and this was it! The wishbone is the perfect size and weight and I just LOVE wearing it. Can't believe I got such a great pendant for such a low price. I would reccomend this product to any woman who wants something a little different from the norm. The chain was too dainty for me, but this is an easy fix if you have a favorite chain of your own or you prefer the look of a small, thin, dainty chain. Again, I just want to say I LOVE this pendant so much! It deserves 10 stars! ;) <end>  Jewelry is very subjective, but this is really nice.  Bought this for my wife a while back. And she absolutely loves it. The finish on the pendant is really good. The chain doesnt seem to match it exactly, but my wife loves fine chains... so you see... all subjective.Overall a very good product for the price. <end>  beautiful and great quality for such a LOW price  i love this necklace!! it's so delicate and crafted so well... only for 15 bucks! i also love the fact that i can silver against my brown skin; normally the chains of sterling silver necklaces are so thick and shiny that it looks really harsh, this is only one of two necklaces in silver (the other one is a tiffany's cross necklace) that i love to wear, its very delicate but fairly sturdy. so timeless and classic too! and as usual, SUPER fast shipment through my amazon prime (so worth the annual fee!!!). <end>  Good for the price )  I am pleased with this product especially for $15, it was just what I expected i love the wishbone ) The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the chain seems too thin and fragile but i may get another one for it. I have got compliments on it already so it's def worth the price ) <end>  Pretty!!  I don't want to give it 5 stars yet but I'm very pleased and happy with my purchase so far.  ) <end>  Great Gifts!  Im always afraid to buy jewlery online. You just never know. I was fortunate that when these( i ordered two) arrived, they were just as the picture shows. The chains on my necklaces were not knotted, unlike a few other reviewers who had the knotting problem. Hopefully the intended parties for these necklaces love them! <end>  Great Buy  So pretty and so affordable. My chain wasnt tangled but if it was, it wouldnt be a big deal. Well worth the $ <end>  Love the necklace, hate the clasp  The necklace is very pretty and dainty, but the clasp is so tiny that it requires the skill of a surgeon to put it on. Otherwise, I love the necklace. <end>  Wishbone necklace  Very nice piece. Will need a new chain but worth the price. Just enough when I don't want to wear a lot of necklace <end>  Make a wish!!  As described a small delicate chain and sterling wishbone. It came in a black pouch in a small box. nice.. <end>  love it  Very good quality sterling silver, not flimsy or light weight. Put it on and received two compliments in one day! <end>  Very nice product  I love it . I wore it Thanksgiving and it is perfect. I also happened to have a set of wishbone earrings so this is great <end>  perfect  I get compliments on this all the time. I have it for about 6 months and have had no problems. <end>  Exactly as pictured  Medium sized, what I was looking for in a necklace. Durable, nice material. Chain was nice quality as wellGreat <end>
 B000NGMODC  Sterling Silver Black Cubic Zirconia Flower Pendant, 18" ||	  Beautiful necklace!  I purchased this for my mom from the website. I did not see it ahead of time, and received an excited phone call from her about how much she loved it... then another one later about how many compliments she received on it.When I finally saw it in person, I was pleasantly surprised. The black CZ really catches the light and people's eye. I considered giving the necklace 4 stars because the chain is flimsy, but that part is really negligible since the pendant itself is the main product. It is worth it to have the pendant and switch out the chain if you do not like the quality.Also, Amazon has a lot more matching products to this, so I have been buying my mom extras to supplement her pendant. I am glad I bought this for my mother, and she is too! <end>  Cute Black Flower Necklace  I needed a necklace for my son's Bar-Mitzvah. I had already purchased the outfit. The top was white with black flowers and a silver button. I searched Amazon for black flower silver - and found this perfect necklace. Everyone thinks it cost a lot of money - and are shocked when I tell them how inexpensive it was! It brought the entire outfit together. It is a lot smaller than it appears on the computer - about the size of a nickel, but it is really cute. My only complaint is that the chain is so delicate it is hard to put on myself and I have to ask for help. I highly recommend this necklace! <end>  Flower Power!  This is a cute necklace that has a wonderful texture. The craftsmanship could use a little improvement, there is more silver showing on the edges of the petals than I would care for. You can't really see the sloppiness of the craftsmanship unless you inspect it very closely, which won't happen when you are wearing this otherwise lovely piece. <end>
 B000NGMOU0  18k Gold Plated Sterling Silver Ruby and Diamond-Accent Cross Pendant, 18" ||	  Nice gift for a little girl  I paid about ten dollars with a special promotion discount. This necklace will make a nice gift for a little girl or young lady. The quality is good for the price. <end>
 B000NGOGCY  Sterling Silver Simulated Diamond White Baby Shoe Charm ||	  looks a little different from the picture  Body of the shoe is whiter than it looks. But the stones are also shinier than they look. Overall I liked this charm, but it does look a little different in person. <end>
 B000NGOGHO  Sterling Silver Enamel Umbrella Charm ||	  Excellent Quality!  This charm is without flaw. Very nice detail. 3-dementional and nicely polished and finished. Would buy this again for sure <end>  Nice looking charm  It's a very nice looking charm. I wear it on my charm bracelet. Before buying it I was thinking the top of the umbrella was silver, but it's white enamel. <end>
 B000NGOGIS  Sterling Silver Enamel Blue Bikini Charm ||	  Nice charm  I'm very pleased with this item, it's even nicer than it looks in the picture and makes a lovely addition to my charm collection.I'm glad I bought it. <end>
 B000NGOGJ2  Sterling Silver Sapphire Turtle Charm ||	  very cute  this is a nice size and the sapphires are very pretty. Nice gift for a young lady that is not fully girlie! <end>  Very pretty  It is slightly smaller than I expected. It seems like really good quality though. I ordered this for a friend and she seems to love it. <end>  Looks just like it  Got this as a gift for my mom, it looks exactly like the picture. Pleased with the purchase, I would definitely buy it again. <end>  Excellent Product! Pleasantly Surprised!  I was very impressed with this item. For the price I did not expect too much, but it is quite sturdy metal and the stones are a gorgeous color. I would have expected this to cost much more for the craftsmanship. My sister will love it! <end>  Gorgeous  This is a beautiful pendant, just as described above. It actually looks even better in person. Not at all &#34;cheap looking&#34;. <end>  It's Okay  looks fine, suit for young girls. The color and shape is satisfactory, but I am disappointed with it's small size. <end>  Turtle Necklace  Absolutely Gorgeous, and adorable!!!!!!!Goes perfect with many outfits. The size is just right. The coloring and quality is beautiful. <end>  Great find!  Great gift! I was concerned it was going to be small after reading some of the reviews, but it is really perfect. I actually bought it and put it on a necklace chain and it looks great! I recommend the Singapore Nickel Free Chain if you do not want to put it on a bracelet. <end>  .  The turtle charm arrived a day later than promised which was a problem and was smaller than expected.Price not bad. <end>  Cute little tortuga!  This is a cute little pendant, and with the sapphire stones, it will make my daughter smile this holiday season. My September baby (well, not so much a baby - she's a teen now!) will find this just grown up enough to not be little girl jewelry, but the turtle will keep it young enough for her to find it cute. And, it's a great size - not too big, but not too small. <end>  Cute Little Charm  I got this on the lightning deal so it was $15 I believe. It's sturdy well made, and heavy for it's size which I like. I don't think it would be worth what is stated as the retail price, but the going price of $25 is fair enough. The sapphires are a bit dark - but that was actually expected especially since they are smaller stones. <end>  It's really cute, but...  I was expecting some brighter sapphire stones, and its shorter than an inch...Overall, it's still a nice piece of jewelry, i just wish it was a little bigger <end>  love this turtle!!  Very nice, I love this little turtle, will wear it often. Stones are dark, but very pretty would consider as gift A++++++ <end>  Very Pretty  This turtle is about the size of a charm bracelet charm. It is hard to see the blue but for direct sun light but pretty nonetheless. <end>  Turtle charm  This is a nice size charm, that is well made with the jewels nicely set. The only thing that I didn't realize, when purchasing, it is hollowed out underneath. It does look just like the picture from the top. I will keep it because of the quality. <end>  Sterling Silver Sapphire Turtle Charm  I ordered this as part of a birthday gift. Was disappointed when it arrived with one of the sapphire stones missing, so had to send it back for a replacement. It was also a smaller charm than I'd expected. The replacement arrived in good order and via overnight delivery. Amazon directed me to order that overnight service and promised reimbursement for that service, but I have yet to see reimbursement. <end>  Sapphire Turtle charm  very nice product, wearing the charm with the necklace that i have purchased. It arrived on time and in good shape. <end>  Turtle  He's a little smaller than what I thought , but I love it because it will always remind me of our trip to Maui where we all swam in the surf where therewere oodles of turtles. <end>  Very cute!!  This little charm is simply charming!! The stones are quite dark yet in the sun shine the most brilliant blue. I got this for my gird friend and she wore it as a necklace for a a time before putting it on a bracelet she wears almost daily. I could not be happier and for the price you cannot go wrong!! <end>  Adorable Turtle Charm  I love turtles and I saw this charm and thought that it would be a really nice addition to my turtle necklace collection. It is a very dainty charm, and the sapphires were quite a bit darker than I expected them to be, but I do think it's very pretty and I am glad I bought it. <end>  so tiny yet so cute  This is my second purchase from Amazon collection, and I am really please (I have 2 more orders waiting to arrive). I originally thought this turtle charm will be a little bigger, but it is really small (imo). It came with a cute little shipping box, inside that is another small gift box, and inside that box is a tiny jewelry bag and a super tiny turtle charm. How small? Well, just take out a dime, lay it on top of a table, and then put the turtle on top of it. The measure of the turtle from head to tail is exactly the same as the diameter of the dime. Or just hold the dime up to your computer screen.NOTE  The bottom of the turtle is not solid/flat, it is concave in, but the good thing about this is that it is lighter to wear and the lights were able to shine through the sapphire, make it the more appealing. Also, this craftsmanship of this turtle is really detail and lifelike.Another thing, I believe this charm IS made of real silver. When I flip the turtle over, the left back leg have 925, and the right back leg have CHINA etched on it. <end>  Love this teeny tiny turtle!  After opening the teeny tiny pouch, emerged a teeny tiny turtle. Aside from not really paying attention to dimensions, I am really happy with this purchase. I am a turtle lover and collect them. I didn't do well converting the millimeters to inches and expected it to be a little larger. I do however have to say that this is a nice quality little gem.I don't need large always to be content with my choice. <end>  simply beautiful  This turtle is simply beautiful. It is larger than I expected but the sapphires are dark blue and sparkle in the silver setting. You need to be careful if you wear it on a charm bracelet. It does tend to catch on clothing etc.I would definitley recommend it. <end>  WOW Great Product  This product is beautifully crafted and was more than what I expected. My girlfriend absolutely adored this charm and I am glad I bought it. Thank You!! <end>  Such a beautiful charm!!!  I was looking for the "perfect" turtle charm to add to a charm bracelet that I had purchased for my niece's Graduation... and this was definitely it! She absolutely loved it and turtles aren't even her thing, although they are mine (as you may have figured from my pen name)! I even purchased one for myself and I absolutely adore it. It is one of my favorite pieces of "turtle jewelry" and I do have quite a collection. I think that anyone who enjoys turtles and nice jewelry would be quite pleased with this charm! <end>  Beautiful!  We bought this as a gift for my daughter's turtle-loving friend.It's beautiful. The silver was shiny and the gems are gorgeous. It arrived in a nice box with care and return instructions. <end>  Adorable!  I received this charm for Christmas and I love it! It is very well made and so adorable. I just put it on a silver chain and wear it as a pendant because it deserves that much attention! <end>  Lovely Charm  I love this charm. The sapphires sparkle prettily. It's beautiful and I love wearing it. I've gotten compliments on it. I recommend this charm. <end>  Cute Litte Charm  Glad I finally bought this little turtle charm. Seems to be very well made and looks great. Hopefully wife will also enjoy it when she sees it at christmas !! <end>  Beautiful Charm  I just received this turtle charm in the mail today. It is beautiful and stunning. It is the perfect charm to put on a necklace. I have looked everywhere to find a turtle charm from jewelry stores to the mall. This one is perfect. I highly recommend buying it. I hope this helps with your decision. It did in mine. <end>  Charming  I got the turtle as a special offer and was very pleased at how beautiful it was when I got it. Was going to give as a Christmas gift but decided to keep it for myself. <end>  The perfect gift for my Girlfriend!  My partners favourite animal is a tortoise. Her birthstone is sapphire and she owns a much loved charm bracelet.Couldn't have been more perfect. <end>  Awesome  These were for my granddaughters. They were on a swim team called the"Blue Turtles". These littles turtles were a hit!I was so pleased they arrived on time for Christmas. Thanks <end>  She loved it  My hunnnie Barbie loves turtles. Sapphires and sterling silver. She loves it. another home run for super hubby. Because I love her! <end>  super cute!  This is the perfect cute little charm for someone that loves turtles. It is exactly what I expected it to be. <end>  Deep Blue Stones  Extremely nice, well-set, deep-blue stones. Great gift for any occasion. Excellent value and nicely packaged for gifting. Would recommend for any turtle lover! <end>  Wonderful  Tiny little turtle looks very nice. Gf never takes it off and it holds up well and look good. would buy again. <end>  Beautiful  This was purchased as a Christmas gift which (shamefully) hasn't been given yet, so I can't comment on the person's reaction. I however, find this piece very beautiful. As other reviewers have said, it is small, but it looks well made with good quality silver. I wish I'd ordered 2! <end>  Beautiful Charm  This was a beautiful charm and have received alot of compliments on it. It was exactly how it looked on the web. <end>  Cheap look and feel  It looked so cheap I didnt bother giving it. I was going to give it for a charms braclet my wife has since it looks cute, but it looks so cheap in real life that I'll just bin it. <end>  fast shipping  was smaller then I expected and I thought it had a chain.Over all it looked nice I guess.I gave it to my youngest and She had a chain that She put it on <end>  Pretty addition to a a silver charm bracelet  This is a pretty, well priced addition for anyone that loves animals and enjoys collecting charms for her bracelet.Sapphires are a nice special touch. <end>  Perfect  I was thrilled with this item. It is exactly as it was advertised. I love it and the recipient does, too <end>  Turtle Love  Purchased this for my best friend along with a sterling silver chain and she absolutely fell in love with it. The quality is that of which you find in the fine jewelry stores. It arrived before the due date and was packed nicely. Highly recommend. <end>  Sapphire turtle charm  This product comes highly recommended. I am very pleased with the quality of my turtle charm. I would definitely recommend to all my friends, or family. The quality is better than I expected! I wear it every day. I'm very pleased with this turtle charm. <end>  charm  I've wanted a turtle charm and I'm glad I purchased this one. The sapphire adds to this charm. I recommend this to anyone. <end>  Cute  This turtle charm is cute. I am wearing it on a chain. The stones are very dark. You could almost think they are green or black. Nice for a turtle lover. <end>  Nice..but..  Very cute charm, though my first impression of the charm was not impressive. The sapphire is extremely dark - it seems almost black instead of blue - and also have a duller shine than I expected. The silver part of the charm is extremely shiny and not cheap looking. But when I put it on it grew on me and I got comments on how cute it was. I'm quite satisfied by my order, though I just wish the sapphire was better cut and put in. <end>  A cute gift for turtle lovers.  My wife became fascinated with the product, is a little smaller than it appears in the picture but is happy to have him.Mi mujer quedo fascinada con el producto, es un poco mas chico de lo que parece en la foto pero esta feliz de tenerlo. <end>  I Love the charm  I love the charm, and I love blue it is my favorite color. I wore it a few times. I am not a big fan of turtles, but the charm is beautiful. <end>  Sapphire turtle charm  Great quality, came quickly, bought for my grandaughter whose birthday is in Sept. she has just started wanting jewerly and loved this birthday stone piece <end>  so cute  I gave this little guy as a Christmas gift last year and she still wears it. It is a tiny turtle but very shiny and adorable. If you know a turtle lover, this is a must have to their collection. I promise you she will love it. <end>  Super cute and better than I expected  This turtle is super cute and much better quality than I was expecting for the price. My daughter loves it and it looks really cute on her. the size is just right and it's not too heavy but not too light either. <end>  Charming charm  Got this charm for my daughter for Christmas. It is beautiful, is very high quality and was exactly as advertised. Shipping was perfect. Here in plenty of time for the holiday. <end>  Not exactly what I thought it would be..  This has the potential of being the cutest turtle charm ever! But the only disappointment I had when receiving this item is that the sapphires are not as bright and shiny as they look in the picture. The sapphires are dull and look almost black. Other than that though it's a very cute lightweight charm. I ended up returning it (thank you amazon for making it so easy) so I've never worn it and can't tell you how it looks on a bracelet. <end>  bigger than I thought, beautiful  I bought these for my daughters for christmas,they are bigger than I thought they would be and really pretty.I gave it four stars because of the sapphires. They look black and dark. I wish it would receive the light better to make them lighter.But beautiful all the same! <end>  Nice Charm!  Nice charm for a bracelet. The size will go well with other charms; not too large and not too small. <end>  Turtle charm with sapphires  Bought this lovely charm for a very good friend of mine. She decided to put it on a necklace and she absolutely loves it. Can't beat the price and delivery was in 3 days. Even came in a tiny purse which added to its great looks. A winner here.Pete <end>  Dainty & Gorgeous!! &#9829;  OK, so this is actually a tortoise. However, for me, that's even better!! My amazing husband & I raise Sulcata Tortoise's & I'm always on the make for a good deal regarding practically anything tortoise. This was definitely a great deal!! Appears to be actual solid sterling silver, nickel-free, etc. There are 10 gorgeous, small, blue sapphires that help make up the shell of the tortoise...they are prong fitted & done very well. While I wouldn't wear this 24/7 as you shouldn't wear real gemstones in the shower daily, I do use it as a daily necklace on a dainty, sterling silver, ball necklace. Lovely! &#9829; <end>  So cute!  I thought this charm was really cute. I kept it for myself for my charm bracelet although I had intended to give it as a gift. Fast service. Great price on sale. Well made. <end>  Nice little charm  This charm was good quality and just as expected. Looks lots like pictured charm and is shiny and scratch free. No complaints  ) <end>  Was very adorable.  I purchased this for my graddaughter for a Christmas gift. She was so excited when she opened it. She said, WOW! This is exactly what I wanted. I love it.&#34; <end>  Pretty charm  Got this for Christmas. It is a pretty charm with a connecting piece that is large enough to easily slip it on and off different chains. <end>  Love it!  This little charm is so cute! Good quality for the price, too. The blue sapphires are a dark blue, but def. not blackish. <end>  a miss  The turtle arrived without one of the stones on the back of the turtle. Tried to find it in the sack, but w/o success. As it was to be a gift to be presented next days, was very disappointed. <end>
 B000NGOGJW  Sterling Silver Small Cross Pendant, 18" ||	  Love it!!  This pendant was exactly what I expected! I was looking for something small - this is perfect. I wear it all the time. This is also a great size for small children. <end>  Nice, but returned  The cross is very nice, but larger than expected. I'm looking for an extremely small cross. Beware the chain clasp. The ring end was bent (received that way) to fit through the bail on the back of the cross and wouldn't slide on the clasp end for security. <end>  Adorable  This is perfect for anyone who loves petite jewelry & something that's not heavy-just enough. Also my grandchildren are just learning about God, this is a nice reminder that he is always with them. I love it! I would have given it 5 stars but I haven't had it long enough to be sure of durability. <end>  Small cross  The cross was smaller than I'd expected but being as it's for a young fella, it's fine. It'll most likely get lost or broken any how. IMO the cross would be an excellent size for a really young one-baby or toddler, but with a shorter chain. The chain is quite nice that it comes on. <end>
 B000NGOGLK  Sterling Silver "Love" Pendant, 18" ||	  Poor quality.  Bought this as bridesmaids gifts and had to return this item. Item more suited for a child. Pendant ok but chain thin and of poor quality. <end>  very disappointing  When I opened this I absolutely loved the charm, it was exactly what I was looking for. The chain was of very poor quality, thin and really flimsy. I decided to go ahead and wear it this week and get a new chain over the weekend. The chain broke on second wear and pendant was lost. It was very disappointing. <end>
 B000NGOGRE  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz 7-Stone Ring, Size 5 ||	  pretty ring with wrong stone color  I purchased this ring to go with my very pretty blue topaz earrings. The ring looks very nice, but the stone color is not like any of my blue topaz jewelry, more like a VERY light aquamarine, almost white! I am going to keep it anyway because it is a lovely ring and the price was right, but the picture is a misrepresentation, therefore only 3 stars. <end>  Looks Can Be Deceiving!  First of all, I was prepared for the ring to be a lighter shade of blue than that pictured. I was warned by several other reviewers that the shade is less than would be expected, AND they were right on the money. The stones in this ring are barely blue, and really not very pretty. It looks cheap and I would agree with one other reviewer who stated that it would have been better to have 5 slightly larger stones instead of the 7 smaller ones. It spans too far across the finger and the sizing does seem to be slightly smaller than the size stated. Save your money for something better. Even at half price, which is what I paid, it was not worth the money. <end>  Picture is not a good depiction  The color of the ring was not as pictured, hint of the palest blue. The sizing is a bit smaller than anticipated and it seems that the stone side is more flat instead of round. It probably would have been more flattering to have 5 stones and a more circular appearance.It still stacks and is not that bad for the price <end>   (  Day 3 of wearing this ring  One of the stones fell out and I don't know where it is!!!!!!!!!!! <end>  Ring review  cheap cheap cheaply made. and the stones are definately NOT blue, more like a dull gray <end>  Very pretty ring and well made...  ...the stones are a very light pale blue, almost clear looking in color in certain lights. I bought this for my daughter to stack with a cz one, a citrine and a peridot. Next to the cz it is hard to tell them apart at certain angles. However, they did a good job of matching up all the stones. The stones are NOT cloudy and are bright and sparkly. I believe a ring like this with clear AND richer blue color would cost A LOT more....so that is why I gave it a 4 star. At the sale price (and if you are not buying it for the specific color) it is a good value.Also, when the citrine ones were on sale I bought one and then ordered 2 more for gifts since the first one was so pretty. All three rings are different in size of stones and color. The larger the stones, the less color and clarity. I expected this because they are not simulated stones. It's a good idea to realize that when buying rings, etc., on-line. I prefer the smaller, more clear and colorful stone/rings, however, I am very happy with them all considering the price. <end>  Disappointed  I ordered the Blue Topaz 7-Stone Ring. I got a cubic zirconia type stone...It was NOT blue. I don't like the white stone and didn't order it. <end>
 B000NGOHAK  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  Okay for everyday wear.  This is a bracelet I will wear casually and not really care too much if anything was to happen to it. The quality isn't too shabby as the other reviewers suggested, but I do agree that the stones are VERY light blue in color.Suggestion  only get if you can get it for a super discounted price like I did. I wouldnt pay anymore than $20 for it. <end>  poor quality  didnt look like the picture on your site. The blue topaz is very light in brightness and silver looks very cheap. Will not be buying jewelry from your site again! <end>
 B000NGOHD2  Sterling Silver Citrine Hoop Earrings ||	  Pleased  The earrings arrived and were smaller than I thought they would be but they look great. When the light hits them they sparkle a lot and catch a lot of looks from others. <end>  loose gems get lost  First of all, these are pretty small, but look nice, and are colorful. I ordered and received them at the end of Nov., and gave them to my girlfriend for Christmas. She loved them, of course, but within a week, each earring had lost a setting, and the 30 days return time had expired. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE!!!!!!!!! <end>  The stones are really pale  The stones are really pale, almost like clear crystal i don't see much of yellow tones in them, nevertheless very shinny. <end>  Really Nice  These are actually really nice earrings. I bought them for a great price on amazon and am amazed. The topaz color is really pretty and they are a great price. I am really happy with them. <end>
 B000NGOHYQ  18k Gold Plated Sterling Silver Multi-Gemstone and Diamond Accent Pendant, 18" ||	  disappointing  I purchased this item a week ago. The shipping was fast and great! The pedant looks very cheap, it is smaller than I thought and does not sparkle like the other review said. The chain is very bad looking as well. I had to return it. <end>  Very pretty.... Nice Colors.... Good size  Love the pendant, very pretty, nice size stones with bright colors. The chain broke the second day, but that's to be expected - I didn't buy it for the chain anyway. So, buy it for the pretty pendant, and get yourself a better chain. <end>  Lovely but chain is not very appealing.  Nice piece but you will need to get a new chain for it. Smaller than I expected but nice. <end>  Beautiful Piece  This is a very pretty pendant that came with a nice chain as well. The multi-gemstone look is very trendy right now and this necklace is done very well. I had several nice comments about it when I wore it. <end>
 B000NHRS14  Grandma Blessing Bracelet ||	  nice gift  I got this for both of my daughters Grandma's for mothers day. The bracelet is a nice charm bracelet that is not too over the top. It is a nice stle and not spelling out grandma makes it a little more hip. The charms are cute and so is the little story. very nice gift. <end>
 B000NHRYZO  GENUINE 18K GOLD link BIG screw steel MENS BRACELET!! ||	  Beautiful and strong enough  The piece is like described. I have used it for about 6 weeks, even at the swiming pool and beach, and it keeps same original aspect and brightness. Price was good and delivery super fast. <end>  bracelet  i like the item i bought from your store...but the problem only is that it takes almost a month to reach me..(korea)anyhow..i love it! <end>
 B000NHS2H8  Sleek and Stylish Handcuff style Men''s Surgical Steel Bangle Bracelet with Carbon Fiber ||	  Simple yet Stylish  I'd been looking for a bracelet/bangle to wear on my right wrist to complement my silver watch on my left for awhile when I stumbled across this item.I've received a LOT of compliments from both men and women on this bracelet. It does 'look' like a handcuff at first glance (I don't see it), which makes it appear more exotic than it is (I guess this style of bracelet isn't very common in my locale).It is well made and sturdy. The locking mechanism is smooth and is simple to operate. The lock CAN pop out if enough force is exerted on the bracelet, but I've never had trouble with it while dancing. The hinge was very tight when I first got it, but it's loosened to a comfortable level after some use.The only complaint I have is that even at 7.5", it's still TOO BIG (standard Men's size is 8") for my wrists and sometimes slides up my forearm, which can get annoying. If this came in 6.5-7", I think it'd be perfect for a guy with small wrists like myself. <end>  Draws Compliments  Most seem to like the half-a-set-of-handcuffs look. Be careful with it though - it will scratch. <end>
 B000NHW350  Triplane Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Different!!  these are nice cufflinks. i thought they were a little bit smaller than what they really are. They look good on white dress shirt <end>  Great  i bought the cufflinks for my husband on our thirteen anniversary and it came right on time. it was affordable and looked just as presented and best of all my husband loved it. keep up the good work. ideal for someone that likes flying whether as a hobby or a pilot. <end>  Very unique!  My husband is a pilot, and a huge airplane buff. He likes wearing french cuff shirts to work, so I thought this would be a hit. My husband loved them, and that was my goal. They arrived in a very timely manner,great price,and nice presentation box. Thanks cuff-daddy, I would buy from you again. <end>
 B000NHXF20  One of A Kind Unisex Handcuff Style Surgical Steel Bangle Bracelet 7.5" ||	  NICE BRACELET  This is a nice bracelet.But,it's not for every wear. I have to take it off when I write. <end>

 B000NI1CGK  Amazon.com  Bleach Group Ten Necklace  Clothing ||	  Awesome!  I Love my necklace! It's just like it's depicted in the photo only a shade or two darker. It came in its original packaging and arrived even before I expected it to. I'm very pleased with my purchase definitely would recommend to anyone who is a fan of Squad 10! <end>
 B000NI37XQ  Clearly Charming Celebrate Mom Crystal & Silver Bracelet ||	  Beautiful  Excellent quality, my mother wears this daily. It still looks shiney and new. It was a wonderful mothers say gift and I am thinking of getting another for my stepmother. <end>  bracelet  When i purchased this along with the matching necklace, the company sent me an email saying that they had a tarnished bracelet and they wouldn't send it to me so i had the option to wait for a new one or to cancel the order. So i chose to wait and to be honest they sent it right away and gave me back the shipping money. But the bracelet is not as shiny as the necklace at all. It's as if it's made of stainless steel not silver plated. I don't know if this is the tarnished bracelet they were talking about in their email because i have nothing to compare it to except the necklace. It's not like the picture. <end>  Beautiful bracelet for price  I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it. It was nice quality for the price and it came packaged in a pretty dark blue box. <end>
 B000NIG9JA  14k Rose Gold Round Pave Hoop Earrings (2 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity) ||	  horrible - don't do it  The diamonds were dirty and cloudy. The earrings looked terrible. There was also 1 diamond missing from the earrings. I guess you get what you pay for and there was no bargin here. <end>  These earrings stink!  The earrings I got ARE NOT the same as presented in the picture. What I got is of a cheaper quality and they are not what I want at all. I would not recommend anyone to buy these earrings. A waste of good money. <end>  Terribly disappointing.  Item arrived with a missing stone and one of the hoop hinges did not lock tightly. Terribly disappointing as the earrings were beautiful. <end>  No sparkle. Looks like textured silver earrings  I bought these at 50% off and was hopeful to get a beautiful pair of 2ct diamond hoops for going out to dinner,the ballet etc. I opened the box and was so diappointed. They have NO sparkle. They look like textured white gold or something because the diamonds are sooo small. How diappointing! They are going back. <end>

 B000NIZ47S  Sterling Silve Square Garnet Ring, Size 6 ||	  Sterling & Garnet ring...  Very nice ring, but why no size?I took the chance that it would fit, but even if it was the only size that was available, why not state what size it is? <end>
 B000NJ0UIA  Sterling Silver Solitaire CZ Ring - Size 6 ||	  Nice quality for the price.  I don't know if I would pay the list price of $50, but this ring is a very nice quality item for the price I paid  $18. It arrived in a ring box.It seems comfortable. The stone is oval, not round. It's kind of hard to tell that from the photo. The burnished setting around the stone isn't absolutely perfect, but it seems quite good. The ring doesn't sit too high off my finger, and the flush setting is nice because it won't catch on my clothes.Overall, I'm very satisfied. <end>
 B000NJ2ZQA  Sterling Silver Onyx/Flower Design Ring ||	  What size?  Lovely ring! Too bad Netaya customer service was unable to tell me the size of this ring.  ( <end>
 B000NJDR3K  Sterling Silver Chinese Character for the Year of the DRAGON Horoscope Charm, 1 1/8 inch tall ||	  Good gift  Great Gift this Chinese Pendant,gift for this,who likes interesting[..] with a 18' a chain. <end>
 B000NJFSI2  Sterling Silver Chinese Character for RICH Pendant, 1 inch tall ||	  Error  This is not a RICH pendant, this character means HAPPINESS AND LUCK. When hang upside down, it means HAPPINESS AND LUCK ARRIVE. What a disappointment, since I got it for my niece for her birthday. <end>
 B000NJFSQO  Sterling Silver Chinese Character for DETERMINATION Pendant, 1 inch tall ||	  five stars  I ordered a product from this company, and in 48 hours, it was in my mail box. I love what they sent me. I will do business withSabrina again, and I lok forward to it. I can't believe the speed and the quality of what they sent me. I am extremely happy. <end>  AWESOME  I LOVE THIS PIECE, SMALLER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT, I LOVE IT AND IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL PIECE..I DECIDED TO WEAR THIS INSTEAD OF HAVING ANOTHER TATTO PLACED SOMEWHERE FOR "DETERMINATION OR THE WILL"SMALLER PIECES IN STERLING OR PEWTER, ARE ALWAYS A BETTER CHOICE, I DO WEAR MORE THAN ONE PIECE AT A TIME.I ALWAYS WEAR MY CHAKRAS, ON WRISTS OR EARRINGS, INCLUDING MY NECK, FOR PROTECTION, CHAKRAS FOR BALANCE....THIS IS PERSONAL TASTES AND MY BELIEFS.....NAMASTE <end>

 B000NJJ1A8  Sterling Silver Double Heart on Cross Pendant, 1 1/8 inch tall ||	  Perfect for a man  I bought this for my husband for our 42nd Anniversary. He wears a dog tag for the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and I thought what a great anniversary gift to wear with his dog tag. A symbol of how our marriage is united with and blessed by God. He loves it and wears it every day. It's just the right size for him, not too small and not too large. It's not shiny, more of a matte type finish and it doesn't look thin or cheap like some sterling silver. It's a perfect piece of jewelry for a man who really doesn't like jewelry (like my husband). <end>  Great piece of jewelry  My 12 year-old niece loves it! I bought it as a Valentine's gift for her and she wears it all the time. I was afraid it would look cheap because of the great price, but it is really beautiful. Wonderful craftsmanship. <end>
 B000NJUY7C  Sterling Silver Butterfly Toe Ring ||	  TOO CUTE!  This is the cutest toe ring. It is a summer must have. It looks good dressed up or down. <end>
 B000NJY5F4  Sterling Silver Crab Toe Ring ||	  tiny. difficult to adjust. painful to wear  I got a lackluster and marginally impersonal response from this company when I wrote in and asked them if they'd accidentally sent me a child-size toe ring. I'd never received one so tiny before or had this issue at all via amazon, let alone brick & mortar jewelry stores. It is a pain to adjust, and will slip off adjusting it to the size of my other toe rings when they're not extended whatsoever. That was my cue that I wasn't imagining the discrepancy lol it's painful to keep on when adjusted to the point that it won't slip off. Save your $ unless you're buying it for a toddler. If you extend it so it fits your smallest, normal-sized adult toe, it will fall off. If you tighten it enough so that it will stay on, you can't walk. Someone in eve'saddiction manufacturing dropped the ball somewhere <end>  It broke after a week!  I had originally written a review about this ring after I received it. It was a good review because I was happy at the time. HOWEVER I just had to edit my review because I have only had this ring exactly a week and one of the longest arms or w/e it is broke off!! And dont be fooled the stone in the middle is not like that it is a very small stone in a cone type thing and also it was a little hard to adjust the first time. I will not be purchasing anything else from this company. The only reason it is 2 stars is because I DID like the ring at first. <end>
 B000NKYPNU  Musical Story Books (various titles) ||	  BEWARE  I was excited to come across this product thinking they would be great stocking stuffers for my kids. The package came and there was only ONE music box. The description is deceiving and I thought I would be getting all 8. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I love the product, but would have NEVER purchased them for that price if I knew I was only getting ONE. <end>
 B000NL6E8S  Sterling Silver Cats Eye & Siam Crystal 7 to 9 inch Adjustable Bracelet Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Great  My Partner and I ordered this product in all the colors of the rainbow for our commitment ceremony. We're very happy w/ all the bracelets. They're beautiful. <end>
 B000NL95W0  Pink Crystal Princess Crown Heart Photo Locket Silver-Tone Pendant Adjustable 17" Necklace ||	  Great product. Fast shipping  I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday. It shipped quickly and is very nice. She loved it and thats all I care about. <end>
 B000NLRZKO  Sterling Silver Prominent 6mm Clear Cube Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  I love them!  And so does my daughter. She got these for Christmas, and they are stunning! Excellent purchase, and I'm thinking about getting me a pair of my own. <end>  Positively beatiful!  I ordered the earrings for my 5 year old daughter. They are her first pair of dangling earings. They are the perfect size and look beautiful on her (and on me). <end>  So pretty!  These were a Christmas gift for my mother, and I'm actually a little sad I don't have pierced ears so I can borrow them.  ) They're very dainty, and pick up the colors that are worn with them. They pretty much go with everything. I adore them. <end>  Very pretty  I ordered these as a gift for an 11-year-old girl who is not permitted to wear large earrings. Though they're not blue (the blue hue in the picture is most likely the result of iridescence; the cubes are clear, traditional crystal) they're cute. They do measure an inch in length; however, this is outstretched from the tip of the post to the finishing bead beneath the cube. The dangling portion--cube and all--is 5/8 inches, and the cube itself is a little under 1/4 of an inch; the metal rings are the remaining 3/8. They're very dainty, very pretty, and at a very reasonable price. Would recommend. <end>  Darling earrings  Darling little earrings, arrived in perfect condition and faster than exspected. They are 3/4 of an inch long from top to bottom, and the cube is 1/4 inch, the same size as a 6mm pearl. Great price for them! <end>
 B000NLSTCW  10k Gold Diamond Channel Hoop Earrings (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Diamonds very cloudy, but in general elegant style  I bought these earring hoops when they were on 60% sale. Cost me about $76. When they arrived, I was very disappointed by the quality of the diamonds---no sparkle at all. Also, it hard to put on as well --- the needles are incredibly thick, and the end is dull --- it pained my ears a lot. I took them to a jeweler and got them checked. It turned out that diamonds on them are real, just poor quality. The jeweler sharpened the tips for me so its easier for me to put them on. I am a little bit happier with them now, and since they do look elegantly on my ears, I regard my goal achieved. I give this product 4 stars because they came in right Amazon's description. <end>
 B000NM0R1W  Turquoise Enamel Flower Silver Toe Ring ||	  Cute Cute Cute! But runs small in size.  This toe ring is adorable and of good quality. However you must have the skinniest of toes for it to fit and not either come off or pinch like heck. I bought it for my mom for her birthday and we couldn't even adjust it to fit her toes. I then tried it, and I've had on a toe ring for many years, and it hurt me as well. Too bad because it's really cute and even has a stone in the center which I did not realize when selecting it.No harm no foul though. We are donating it to a benefit auction for a family member with cancer. <end>
 B000NMEX5S  14k White Gold Diamond Ring (1/5 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Pretty, Dainty, Poorly made  The ring is very dainty. It does have some sparkle. The band is very thin, which I liked about it because I have very petite hands. The only problem is that I've had the ring for about a month and a diamond has already fallen out. <end>  great addition to wedding set  This addition makes my wedding set look like a million bucks! Great thin band that adds more sparkle to solitaire and infinity band. <end>  review  excellent rings, the price is great and the workmanship is extraordinary, the only drawback is the extremely long waiting period, i purchased 3 of this rings and are pretty satisfied with them. <end>  Unique shape  Wife loved it, only drawback is she wanted a band to go with it and due to the raised flat sides it has been hard to find one. <end>  LOVE IT  This band is gorgeous. It sparkles and is very feminine. A thin elegant look and goes perfect with my high set engagement ring. I dont want to take it off! <end>
 B000NN2H6E  Medium Sterling Silver Italian Horn Pendant ||	  Spend more, you're worth it  This item looks and feels very cheap - perhaps because it is. It is lightweight because it's hollow, which I didn't expect, and there are visible seams along the sides of the charm where the two halves were joined together, and a hole in the bottom where they weren't joined all the way. The loop where the hook is attached to the charm seems flimsy. <end>  Very Cheap  The charm is very cheap and lightweight as it is hollow. The charm feels more like a cheap piece of plastic. There are highly visible seams along the sides of the charm where the two halves were joined together. The loop where the hook is attached to the charm also seems flimsy. The chain that came with the charm did seem to be decent quality but I did not buy it for the chain. My wife was very disappointed and I returned the item. <end>  Bella Italiana  I love this pendant! I wear it every day. I actually turned mine into a charm necklace by adding other small charms to the chain- I think it's great! <end>
 B000NN61MU  Sterling Silver Peace Sign Necklace ||	  Very happy, it's better than it looks on site.  I was very pleased with the quality of this item. Will definately reccommend Eve's Addiction to all my friends and family. <end>

 B000NNCDRM  10k White Gold Journey Circle Pendant (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  10k White Gold Journey Circle Pendant (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I3 Clarity)  Cheap quality and it shows in the clarity of the diamonds or rather the lack therof. The old adage is right> You get what you pay for. <end>  We returned it  I have always been 100% satisified with Amazon but this item was low quality and we returned it. My first bad review for a product from this nearly perfect online shopping site.Diamonds very low quality and just looked like it came out of a gum ball machine.Amazon gladly refunded money and paid to ship it back. <end>  Not worth the price  If you want to impress someone with a thoughtful and small jewellery, this is not it. My wife didnt like it, didnt event look like (real) diamonds. Dont buy it <end>
 B000NNGEMC  Menacing black crystal skull cufflinks with presentation box ||	  Very attractive cuff links  My son, 42, collects skull jewery. These are very attractive, well made, just what he wanted. The crystal eyes sparkle and the silver shines. Thank you Amazon for your suggestions. <end>

 B000NO126E  Onyx Greek Key Capped "Fortune" Squared Pendant, 14k Gold ||	  Very nice, just smaller than pictured  We just received this pendant, a birthday present for my sister. She's someone who likes bulkier, new agey pendants. This pendant arrived prettily boxed in a small paper Chinese box, and looks just like the image on Amazon, BUT about half the size pictured. Yes, it is really 10 mm! That is, about 1/2 inch. When worn, it is more dainty and tiny a pendant than I had expected (yeah, I saw the size listed here, but I don't think in metric!).On the plus size, this onyx and gold pendant seems to be high quality, has a nice weight to it despite the size, and nice craftsmanship. After getting used to the smallish size, I may just order another one for myself! A very unique and stylish item, this item will go with many outfits and styles despite its asian flair. <end>
 B000NO4KE0  Sterling Silver Genuine Ruby Stone Prong 4mm Round Stud Earrings ||	  Low quality!  The earrings were pretty bad. Scratched up, the backs didn't even come off. Had to throw them out! <end>
 B000NOCXD0  Sterling Silver Round Clear Cubic Zirconia Initial "B" Charm 1 inch Long Pendant ||	  Very Beautiful!  I was very skeptical of ordering sight unseen but could not of been more happy with what I received. My daughter loves it! For the quality and the price you cannot go wrong with this pendant! <end>
 B000NODQY0  0.51 cttw 14k White Round Sapphire & Diamond Heart-shaped Pendant - Chain not included ||	  Very disappointed , Small is not the word.  Pendant looks as if it came from a gum ball machine. Very disappointed in the way it looks.." <end>

Great quality, especially for the price. <end>  "L" pendant  I ordered this pendant for my granddaughter as one of her Christmas gifts. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and the beautiful stones. I think my granddaughter will really like it. Thanks! <end>
 B000NOSMJO  Celtic Cross Belly Button Ring Quality Materials ||	  Love this!  I really love this Celtic Cross Belly Button Ring. I love Celtic Crosses and the detailing on all three is fantastic! Not to mention, the Celtic knots are on both side of the crosses. This is one of my favorite Belly Button Rings! <end>
 B000NPC410  Sterling Silver Marquise Amber Butterfly Ring Size 4,4.5,5,5.5,6,6.5,7,7.5,8,8.5,10 ||	  Very nice ring for the price  This is a cute little ring. The silver and amber are nice quality for the price. It is well made. I have worn it several times without any problems at all. It appears that it will last a long time. I don't have any complaints with the ring. The only thing that I would change if I could is that I would like for it to be a bit larger in scale as in a wider band and a larger butterfly desing. However, all in all, I like the ring. <end>
 B000NRN3HM  Sterling Silver Anklet 9" to10" Length Adjustable Bracelet Made with Swarovski Elements Faux Pearl ||	  Lovely pearl ankle bracelet  This is a beautiful pearl ankle bracelet. It fits well and looks expensive. Lobster clasp is a definite plus. It arrived on time and was well-packaged. So nice I purchased it in pink. <end>  Cheap looking and very poor quality  This ankle bracelet looks like jewlery one could purchase at a Dollar Store. Very poor quality. I send it back to the seller as soon as I received it. <end>  Great value,great quality  if you want to give a personal, high quality item to a loved one....look no further , this bracelet is of high quality & looks more expensive than it is.I would highly recommend it <end>
 B000NRR5N0  Sterling Silver 5.5" to 6.5" Length Adjustable Bracelet Made with Swarovski Elements Faux Pearl ||	  These are pearls  Although the picture looks like metal beads and description states sterling silver, these are pearls. <end>  Perfect Pearl Bracelet  Pearl Bracelet was bought for my 4yr old goddaughter for her birthday. Everyone at her party loved it, especially her. Thank you for such a nice product. [...] <end>  Perfect for Flower Girl  I purchased this pearl bracelet for our 4 yr old flower girl, and it's a really nice quality. I like that it's adjustable, so she can wear it for a few more years. It'll match the bridesmaids pearl bracelets, and I plan to add a charm onto it w/ her initial (personalized just like the bridesmaids!). (price is right too!) <end>  BEAUTIFUL PEARL BRACELET  This bracelet is a beautiful pearl bracelet, as the name implies. It is great the length is adjustable so that my toddler can wear it for many years. She wore it with her Christmas dress this year and everyone loved it! It is very pretty and I am so glad we bought it. The seller ships quickly and overall this was a fantastic transaction. The person who gave it a bad review obviously did not read the title of the bracelet (which clearly stated PEARL). THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL BRACELET THAT ANY LITTLE GIRL (and her mother) WILL LOVE! <end>  Flower Girl Bracelets  My daughter had 5 flower girls in her wedding, and we needed a gift of jewelry which would be affordable, adorable, and non-fragile. The bracelets arrived almost immediately, and because they are adjustable, they fit all 5 girls. It will be a gift which they can wear for years, and the bracelets are not so fragile that they'll break easily. We were delighted and so were the little girls and their mothers. <end>
 B000NRUSMK  Sterling Silver Post Back 1" Dangle Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements 4mm Faux Pearl ||	  Excellent, very pretty earring set...  I bought these for my 7 yr old and she LOVES them. They are excellent quality for the price and just the right size for a young girl. The price is really unbelievable for the quality of earrings....Target, Kohls or WalMart would sell these for 4 to 6 times the price!Update  My daughter has been wearing these everyday since she got them (including showering, swimming, sleeping, playing, etc.) which is for about 20 days. So far, they are holding up well...they look like the day she put them on. <end>  Very pretty  These pearls are all attached to each other, as you can see, and the earrings are small. Better for younger (under 7) girls. Feminine and dainty. <end>

 B000NSV5Q2  Sterling Silver "Bahama" Lt. Green Coin Pearl & Carved Mother-of-Pearl Flower Earrings ||	  Small but BEAUTIFUL!!!  I got these for my mother-in-law for mother's day, I think she will like them. They are smaller then I thought, but I'm very happy!! <end>
 B000NT77PO  DiamonUltra&trade; Cubic Zirconia Silver Crown Ring ||	  crown ring  bought this for my 18 yr.old daughter and she loves it. It is really hard to find a crown ring that isn't tiny. this is not tiny. it is a little bulky for someone with a thin finger. she wears a 5 and it is a little on the big side but she likes it. the only down faults is it is not very shiny. it's sorta dull, not shiny like sterling silver should be. but it is worth the price. <end>
 B000NTCJHA  PalmBeach Jewelry Baby Phat Logo Earrings ||	  cheap looking  I purchased these earrings for my daughter. They look cute in the picture, and it appears like the logo is inside the heart. Instead they appear to be plastic hearts, and logo is just pasted on. The "diamond" looking stones are just ugly. Very cheap looking earrings that went back the same day they arrived. They belong in the dollar store, and even there I wouldn't buy them. <end>
 B000NTI9P6  14k Gold 3-Stone Diamond Ring (3/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Great!  My wife wanted a new ring that she could take with her on trips and use day-to-day. This ring has worked very well, would recommend. <end>
 B000NTK5ZS  14k Gold Princess-Cut Solitaire Engagement Ring (0.05 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Just what she wanted.

But my future wife loves it, that's all that matters to me.The quality is high! <end>  loved it  love the ring it just delivered, i loved it so much i just a to propose right away. she loved it too. highly recommanded <end>  Engagement Ring  The ring came into exactly the day it was supposed to come in. My soon to be fiance already knows it came in but she doesn't know when I will actually pop the big question. I love the ring and I know she will love it as much as I do.14k Yellow Gold Princess-Cut Solitaire Engagement Ring (.05 ct, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity), Size 7 <end>  Princess Engagement Ring  I love this ring. It represents my engagement to a man who happens to be a man of my dreams from early childhood. He is travelling in another country right now and has a better ring for me when he returns home but this one will always be special to me. <end>  Not bad  Its not bad but it appears a little thicker in the image so i was a little surprised at its width/thickness. I haven't proposed yet though so lets see how it goes ;-) <end>  Lovely little ring  This ring looks bigger in the picture than it really is. I bought it as an addition to my diamond ring. It is a lovely little ring that enhances my diamond.I would consider getting another too for the value. I say it was a bargain. <end>
 B000NTMDLM  14k White Gold 3-Stone Round Diamond Ring (1/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  The Best first Gift  I bought this as a first gift for my fianc&eacute;. Remarkable finishing very beautiful ring. For the price I paid, I am delighted. <end>
 B000NTNCEE  10k Gold 7-Stone Shared-Prong Diamond Ring (1/2 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Fabulous Ring!  I have this same ring also in the 1/4 carat total weight, which is nice...but I have to say that this one, the 1/2 carat ring, is fabulous! You can pair it up with another ring, but it's big enough to make a statement on its own...I wear it alone on my middle finger and love it! The diamonds are very good quality for the price and very shiny. It gives me a bit of "glitz" when I go out. This ring is definitely a bargain for the price. <end>  I LOVE IT!! ITS BETTER THEN I EXPECTED!!!  I ordered this ring to go beside my 2 carat ruby solitaire and half carat diamond enhancer and it looks stunning. Had problems with UPS but what else is new, other then that I got it in a timely manner and its fantastic. There are some flaws but that's to be expected and the stones are small enough you cant tell unless your really looking with a magnified glass. If your thinking of ordering it do it, you wont regret it and you seriously cant beat the price!!!! <end>  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED  I ORDERED THIS RING AND RECEIVED SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT.OF COURSE I RETURNED IT AND GUESS WHAT. AMAZON SAID IT WAS NOT THEIR PRODUCT AND REFUSED TO REFUND MY MONEY.THEY SAID THEY INSPECT ALL PRODUCTS BEFORE SHIPMENT YET A FEW DAYS LATER I PURCHASED A CAMERA AND AGAIN I RECEIVED A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CAMERA FROM WHAT I ORDERED.SOMETHING CHEAPER OF COURSE. BUYER BEWARE.ACTURALLY NO STARS FOR WHAT I RECEIVED. <end>  HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!  My fiance and i were looking for a wedding band for me and since we were on a tight budget and didnt have much time because our wedding was in 3 weeks we had gone to jewelry stores in our area and tried on rings with the same color and clarity as this ring to make sure that we knew what we were ordering. Well let me tell you I just received this ring today and it is HORRIBLE! You cant see through any of the diamonds because they are are not I2/I3 these are ALL I3 diamonds and the worst possible I3 they could get their hands on! The color is NOT J/K they are like O/P again the worst ones they could get their hands on! The J/K I2/I3 rings I had tried on at the jewelry stores were really nice looking and you could still see through the diamonds and they werent yellow!!! Dont waist your time just go for a higher quality diamond. I am now stuck 1 week before my wedding without a wedding band because a company doesnt do quality control on their items and just takes peoples money thinking the general consumer doe3snt know any better. Pathetic! At least Amazon is being kind enough to try and get my replacement in on time before the wedding. Lets just hope it works or else I wont be getting a ring placed on my finger at the altar. =( <end>  10K white gold diamond ring 1/2 CTTW  FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY, THE PRODUCT IS EXTREMELLY NICE AND NO ONE CAN GET CLOSE TO THE PRICE. AMAZON IS THE BEST PLACE TO SHOP. THAN YOU <end>  great buy  I purchased this ring to wear in front of my 3 stone ring. It is beautiful. The diamonds are really clear and very shiny. I would definately recommend and will probably purchase another one to wear behind my other ring. <end>  Beautiful!  My fianc&eacute;e is using two of these to go on either side of her engagement band like an enhancer. Sits a lot better than an enhancers we looked at. These look like they cost a fortune...but at a great price with real diamonds. Very pleased. <end>  For Christmas 2012  She loved it at first sight. This ring goes really well with a three stone diamond and not too cloudy. Fit and finish are great and the band does have a little shine to it. All and all no regrets! <end>  Stunning  Simply beautiful. This ring its understated and classy but also eye catching. Diamonds are beautifully cut and look great in the setting. I couldn't be happier, it's perfect. <end>  VERY PLEASED  Someone stole my wedding band less than 1 month before my wedding, so i chose this one! Very pretty....nice and sparkly and goes perfect with my engagement ring even though its not a set. The diamonds are actually bigger than i expected. It looks like I paid more than $300.00. Im very satisfied <end>  Great ring for a easy to swallow price  Bought this ring after returning another in the same style but had only .25 cttw. This one was much better and was not much more for twice the amount of diamonds.One of the seven diamonds was slightly cloudy but the others were not too bad. <end>  Great ring, looks good, wished it was SI1-SI2  A little bit overpriced for being an I2-I3 but just a little bit. Overall the ring was great and my wife loved it. <end>  Very Satisfied  I purchased this ring for my wife because she recently lost her engagement and wedding rings. I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. My wife likes the ring and for the price, it couldn't be beat! <end>
 B000NTT88I  10k Gold 5-Stone Shared-Prong Diamond Ring (1/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Perfect  This was my first online purchase of jewelry, and I was more than satisfied with the shipping speed, quality of the ring, and affordable price. My girlfriend loved the ring, and it is easily resized if needed. I would absolutely recommend this ring for anyone looking for an affordable but classy gift. <end>  50th anniversary  Husband bought this ring for our 50th wedding anniversary. It is simple and elegant. Each diamond, which are not small, represent our fifty years together. I love it. <end>  Wow for the price  I have a large 2.5 carat pear shape engagement ring- Have been looking for a nice wedding band that compliments and does not take away from the ring- this is perfectThe price was amazing checked around and could not come close- yes it's 10k but it will hold up just like the 14k- actually it is stronger So now I have a 17,000 dollar ring paired with a 110 dollar Funny  ) !!!!! <end>  Beautiful ring!!!!!!  My husband purchased this ring for my wedding band and I was MORE THAN satisfied!!!! The ring is beautiful and the diamonds are very clear and sparkle amazing!!!! The shipping was extremely fast, it only took 3 or 4 days to come in. The diamonds are not small at all and was an extremely great deal for the quality!!! I LOVE IT!!!! <end>  Just what I wanted!  I'm posting actual pics, so you can tell the size... It's not huge, but for 1/4 cttw, what do you expect? For the color (J-K) this is actually quite clear, and you cannot see any occlusions in the diamonds. They are not cloudy, and the look is pretty awesome. I debated for months over which right hand ring to buy and for $87, this is well worth the price! You own't be disappointed!! <end>  Too small  The diamonds on this ring were way too small...I got a similar ring at Zales for the same amount, and the diamonds were larger and more brilliant. <end>

 B000NUXPNQ  Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst stone emerald cut lever back leverback Earrings ||	  beautiful  the earrings are very nice, they look much better compared to the picture provided! The amethyst stone colour is a bit lighter than shown. <end>  Stylish ear rings  These were bought for my sixteen year old grandaughter who just received her class ring which is white gold and amethyst. I wanted something to go with her ring. The hooks are fragile and she will have to be careful. The amethyst stones are very light in color but for the price I am pleased. <end>

 B000NVBL9K  14k White Gold 3-Stone Diamond Ring (1/2 cttw, H Color, SI2 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Good quality, good price  Went to Ben Bridge and bought a similar ring for my girlfriend. Then we both decided to see what we could get from Amazon. We ordered this particular ring because it was supposed to be of slightly better quality (based on the Four Cs) at a slightly better price. We would return the one we didn't want.The Amazon ring had so much more brilliance and fire that the choice was easy. It's beautiful. I'm not an expert on jewelry, especially diamonds, but my girlfriend makes her own jewelry, and we both think the Amazon ring is far superior.I'm extremely happy with this purchase and thoroughly trust Amazon because they put their name behind it, and you can return this item "for any reason." Take my word for it, you will pay more at a full-service retail store and get less for your money.Most importantly, my girlfriend loves it. And that's all that counts. <end>  This ring just sparkles  I received this ring for our 30th wedding anniversary from my husband. Love the size, 1/2 carat total and I love the way it sparkles. I could have gotten a bigger ring but I am very happy with this one. Not afraid to wear it every day, which was the whole idea for me. Great ring. <end>  Pretty ring  I just received this ring today. It is really pretty and sparkles alot. It is small but I mean its a 1/2 carat total. If you are a simple girl and are looking for just pretty this is the ring for you!! If you are looking for some bling huge rock its not. <end>  Love this ring!  My husband got this ring for me for our anniversary, and I love it. I don't like solitaire rings that stick out and get caught on things, and this ring has just enough of a post to make the stone sparkle and be gorgeous, but it doesn't get in my way. Beautiful!! <end>  Diamond Ring  I purchased this ring for my wife for Mother's Day. She really likes the ring. It was a great purchase at a great price! <end>

 B000NVQQD6  Sterling Silver Round Shaped Blue Topaz Gemstone Polished Finished 4mm Wide Band Dolphin Ring Size 9.5 ||	  Lovely!  I love this ring. It is graceful and attractive and the stone is just the right size with a good color. It is really nice they offer rings in half-sizes. <end>  Little disappointed  The ring was beautiful when I received it. It was a Christmas present for my niece & she absolutely loved it. Problem is - after wearing it on and off for two weeks - the band has tarnished pretty bad. She will no longer wear it. Kind of disappointed. <end>  Beautiful ring  This ring is very beautiful and it is just as nice as the picture if not better. Perfect size and gemstone is a good size for a delicate ring. Will be checking for products from Gem Avenue first before I even think about purchasing elsewhere. Perfect finish no flaws on band and dolphin is nicely detailed. <end>  not good  This product never got to my home. They sure refound my money back, but I was never able to see the real stuff, because they made a mistake in the address. <end>

 B000NVZBD2  Simulated Turquoise 16mm Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Gorgeous bracelet  I bought this bracelet as a gift for my best friend and liked it so much that I almost kept it! It's very 80s actually, but seriously pretty. The color is truly one of the nicest shades of turquoise that I've ever seen. <end>
 B000NW0J2E  14k Yellow Gold Tiger-Eye Quartz Ball Necklace ||	  5 stars  I bought it at Friday sale, It is so beautiful like the picture, very big size, shining. I love it very much. I will give it 5 stars. <end>
 B000NW0SCA  14k Yellow Gold Red Coral Branch Earrings ||	  Try Your Luck  What I liked about this pair of earrings is the light-weight. Due to the nature of corals, the individual pieces vary in color, texture, and size. The jeweler made a good attempt to piece together corals to ensure homogeneity for each pair of earrings. I ordered my first pair and realized that there was a very noticeable dark spot on one of the coral pieces. So I ordered another set. This set did not have any dark spots, but the coloring was not as deep as the first set. Therefore, I ended up returning both pairs because I felt like I did not receive the great value for the price like I usually do from Amazon. <end>  Earings  Well, these weren't as "gorgeous" as portrayed. I don't feel they were worth the price at all. I would say they are pretty at best. <end>  I'm not sure the color is natural  Please pay attention to description that gem. It is stated that "Gemstones may have been treated to improve their appearance or durability "..And this statement is a warning sign that coral may be not in its natural color. I have bad experiences buying in Dillard's big coral bracelet for 60 dollars and that bracelet started coloring my skin in red and over weeks losing red color. All that happened because it is a common practice to color coral "to improve their appearance". The real red coral may cost well above one thousand dollars and just for very small piece. <end>
 B000NW3FOS  Sterling Silver Genuine Citrine Stone Oval Filigree LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Pretty but wish just a tad bigger  I was looking for citrine earrings to go with a beautiful citrine pendant that I own. I love lever back earrings and these fit my budget perfectly. I like them a lot but do wish they were just a little bit bigger because I have LOTS of hair and they get a little bit lost. However, that is just a slight quibble and otherwise I love them and I wear them often to work. Citrine is the stone of success. Citrine is also a wonderful manifestation crystal by motivating you into taking action. It brings optimism and cheerfulness. The earrings are good quality and the stones are pretty. Overall I think these make good everyday earrings. <end>  Nice  I like these earrings very much, they are a bit smaller than what they appear but overall, I like them. <end>
 B000NW5UNC  Sterling Silver Genuine Garnet stone Bali LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  very delicate and beautiful  Lovely earrings for any occasion. Liked them very much.

 B000NW6Q6C  10k White Gold Marquise Solitaire Diamond Ring (1/10 ct, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  pleasantly surprised  I purchased this diamond ring as a gift for myself to wear as a "right hand ring". For the price, the ring itself is pretty amazing. The stone is exceptionally sparkly and clear, and is actually larger than I thought it would be. I love it!!! <end>  surprisingly beautiful  for this price i expected somthing just ok, but i was surprised , the diamond is really shiny and clear and the ring is just beautiful. <end>
 B000NWCE2W  St. Patrick's Shamrock Sterling Silver Celtic Irish Flag Spinning Band Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  So fun  Love this ring, have it on today, I love the spinning mechanism, it looks exactly as represented <end>
 B000NWK02S  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz stone Teardrop LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Deceiving shot  When I purchased these earrings, I was basing the size by what was shown as decent size topaz, but was so sadly disappointed when I got them. They would suit a little girl and I mean LITTLE girl. Do not buy this product. <end>
 B000NWNOA8  14k White Gold Round Pave Hoop Earrings (2 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity) ||	  horrible - don't do it  The diamonds were dirty and cloudy. The earrings looked terrible. There was also 1 diamond missing from the earrings. I guess you get what you pay for and there was no bargin here. <end>  These earrings stink!  The earrings I got ARE NOT the same as presented in the picture. What I got is of a cheaper quality and they are not what I want at all. I would not recommend anyone to buy these earrings. A waste of good money. <end>  Terribly disappointing.  Item arrived with a missing stone and one of the hoop hinges did not lock tightly. Terribly disappointing as the earrings were beautiful. <end>  No sparkle. Looks like textured silver earrings  I bought these at 50% off and was hopeful to get a beautiful pair of 2ct diamond hoops for going out to dinner,the ballet etc. I opened the box and was so diappointed. They have NO sparkle. They look like textured white gold or something because the diamonds are sooo small. How diappointing! They are going back. <end>
 B000NWOFYC  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stone Round Bali Bead LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Look elegant but NOT  The picture on Amazon makes these earrings look elegant and relatively subtle, but they are neither. They look like something a rapper might wear. I wish I hadn't bought them. <end>
 B000NWQC02  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz Stone Emerald cut LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Statement Earrings  These earrings are big and bold and beautiful! They are simple in their presentation but very elegant. They are large but comfortable to wear and I would recommend them for anyone looking for some elegance! <end>
 B000NWW8I2  Amazon.com  Silver earring with beads  Clothing ||	  Harold's earrings  I love these earrings. They arrived in 2 days. I plan to buy more. <end>
 B000NWXBK6  Sterling Silver Organic Design Ring, Size 6 ||	  Very Original!  I always look for unusual pieces, and this is one of those! This ring is sturdy, and beautifully formed. Love it!! <end>  A favorite  I have a large collection of silver rings, but I find myself wearing this one a lot, in tandem with other cut-out or square rings. A friend joked that it looks as though it had a stone that fell, but I like the unusual design a lot. <end>
 B000NWZKHS  AugustinaJewelry Freshwater Cultured Pearl Earrings 7.5-8mm White Pearls with Silver Mount ||	  Very pretty  They're really gorgeous. They aren't as white, white as pictured but for the price I wouldn't really expect them to be. If I hadn't come back to write this review I wouldn't have noticed that. <end>  Very Nice  For the money, I was thrilled. I thought the appraisal was pretty useless; its poor quality copy, and it has typos. It probably takes from quality of the pearls themselves; my reveiw might be 5-stars without it.Beyond the appraisal, I was very happy with my purchase. Bought them for my girlfriend, to replace a pair of cheap plastic (yes, plastic) pearl-esque earrings. You can tell these are quality pearls, the size is good, not perfectly round (but freshwater pearls are hard to find like that). They have nice weight to them, not to heavy, but...they have weight to them. Substance.For the money spent, this is a very quality pair of earrings and my girlfriend was thrilled. Having a thrilled girlfriend is ALWAYS a plus. <end>
 B000NWZVZY  Amazon.com  Silver and smoky topaz earring  Clothing ||	  pretty and simple  Earrings had a simplistic pretty look and feel. I like it very much. I just wish the stone was darker in color. In the picture, it looks medium brown, but in reality it is a light translucent brown. <end>
 B000NZ1DI0  Pink Ribbon Crystal ANGEL Breast Cancer Awareness Tac Pin! ||	  A very good value  We package items at Church and give them to people on Chemo. This makes a very nice inexpensive item included in their basket. <end>
 B000NZSW7U  Love, Grandmother, Forever Silver & Crystal Expressively Yours Bracelet ||	  Cute bracelet  I ordered a few of these bracelets in different styles as gifts. Though I am not sure they are sterling, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price. It also comes in a nice box that is perfect for gift giving. <end>  Was so Pretty but started to rust  I ordered this for my daughter to give to her grandmother. It came wrapped so nice her grandma loved it. When she opened it she immediately put it on. After about 2 months though it started to rust. Even though it was so pretty I don't think i would buy it again because of that reason. It was worth it for the price to wear for a couple of months. I just wish it didn't rust because she loved the bracelet. <end>  perfect gift!  I bought 2 of these for the grandma's in my children's lives for mother's day. They are such a perfect gift and was also surprised by the quality and presentation. Don't hesitate! <end>
 B000NZSW84  DMM Expressively Yours Bracelet - Peace, Hope, Serenity ||	  okay  I like the charm bracelet, but hate the clasp, it keeps undoing other than that its very pretty and inspirational. It makes a simple and cheap gift with a message! comes with a gift box decorated and all, with satin touch inside. Good for teachers and nurses and co-workers (there are several other charms to pick from) <end>  Very pretty!  It's a pretty braclet that fits well on my wrist. I love these little sentements that comes with it. Comes in a pretty blue box with silve ribbon. I only hope it will last and not discolor. <end>  Bracelet review  I purchased this as a gift to send to a friend in the UK. I chose the option to ship it directly to her. It would not allow me to request gift wrap or even to include a note. <end>  These are SOOOOOO CUTE!!!  I LOVE these bracelets!! I bought the green friendship one for 4 of my friends, my mother and grandmother around ST. Patricks Day. They LOVED them. The color is so rich and I LOVE charm. The clasp is easy to use and I have no fear of it falling off. I actually bought one for myself after I saw how cute they were. I bought the TEACHER one for my kids teachers, The NURSE one for their school nurse, and the PERFECT, PRETTY, PRINCESS one for my daughter. These bracelets are one of my favorite gifts to give. <end>  Beautiful Present  All of these bracelets that I have bought are lovely. The cards that come with them are really cute and the bracelets themselves are beautiful. <end>  BRACELET  I bought two other bracelets like this as well with different sayings as gifts. Very nicely packaged. Nice personal gift for a friend. <end>  Lovely Bracelet  The bracelet was exactly as shown in the picture. It comes in a lovely box with a card that has a poem written on it. My friends loved the bracelets and I am very pleased with the purchase! <end>  Product arrived already broken!  I ordered 10 of these bracelets as holiday gifts for my nieces. Of the 10 ordered 4 arrived already broken (the filigree heart was split open and disconnected). They are prettily packaged and are reasonably attrative, but you have a 2 in 5 chance of receiving a defective item based on my experience. I am seldom disappointed by my orders with Amazon, but this takes the cake. <end>  Can't say enough about these...  ALL of these charm bracelets (and I've ordered most of them for friends, family and (I couldn't resist!) myself) are surprisingly lovely. Each comes in a silk-lined be-ribboned box with a little inspirational poem that matches the inspirational words engraved on the silver beads of the bracelet. A lovely keepsake and beautiful way to express your feelings and hopes for those you love. <end>  Good for the price  The bracelet looks good, the package is very nice. Great small gift for someone younger. Clasp is a little difficult for someone to work alone. <end>  Awesome gift  I bought this bracelet as a gift for my friend, she loved it! It is a nice and meaningful present for any ocasion <end>  unhappy with quality  I bought two bracelets from this company. Was excited they were beautiful but broke first time it was put on! <end>  Beautiful one  I gave this bracelet for my sister. It is really cute when they wear it. She told me that she loves it and ask me for another one. <end>  Great gift @ a great price  Really like these bracelets, bought one for myself, then ordered four more for my sisters and Niece. I've gotten many compliments on how pretty they are. The message each conveys, will be a nice reminder to each giftee, that I'm thinking of them and wishing them well. The only thing is; avoid getting them wet, when washing your hands, the silver plate will come off, so be careful. <end>  Expressively Yours Bracelet   ) i love this bracelet with the gift box, it is very pretty, shipped fast, also bought more for christmas gifts <end>  I like it  This bracelet has very positive words and it is so lovely. I wish it was just more durable. The heart peace off within days of use. And i love it so much that i was actually taking care of it before that happened. Other than that though this is a great bracelet. <end>  Pretty & Truly Expressive!  Great bracelet - good quality. It's not real gems or beads or whatnot. So don't expect that. But it's a great bracelet compared to many others. I love the words carved into it and the beautiful message inside the box. Gifted it to one of my close friends and she loved it. <end>  Excellent poduct for amazing price 5 star  This was purchased in memory of my mother's looking over us from heavan. It arrived in time for me to wear it on mother's day which meant the world to me. Thank you for a great transaction! 5 stars!! <end>  big but cool  This bracelet is big but it is very pretty and religious. It comes in a very nice package with a note that explains the bracelet. <end>  Excellent product  I am very pleased with the bracelet. It is lovely. It was a replacement for one we had bought my Aunt that she lost in a fire. It was much cheaper through amazon than the store we bought the original for the exact same product. <end>  Just beautiful!  My 12-year-old daughter had this bracelet on her Amazon Wish List, and I got it for her for Christmas. It's beautiful and very well-made. Even the packaging is just lovely. Highly recommended! Edited to add  The light blue gift box is gorgeous. I didn't even wrap it! <end>  Gift for sis-n-law  It was better than I expected. At first I wasnt sure about it but I actually would like one for myself. Really pretty. <end>  Very pretty but not the best quility  I think the price should be a bit lower for the quility of the product. I purchased this for my mother on Christmas, its nice and she was happy with it but it looked like I bought it at a dollar store. A+ for packaging. It made it look more expensive <end>  Cancelled order, but plan on reordering.  I placed an order for 4 different types of these bracelets to give to co workers for valentines day, but I cancelled the orders after I read the reviews and most commented on the faulty clasps of the bracelets.I sent an email to DMM expressing my concerns about the clasps being faulty as when you're giving a gift to someone, its really not nice to give a faulty gift, and I must say they promptly responded to my concerns with &#34; We've sold thousands of theses braclets with a very small number of complaints. This is the first i've ever heard of a faulty clasp. If something's wrong with a product you are almost guaranteed to hear from a customer, but if everything's good, you never get the good reviews, people just go about their day. So to judge an item based on a couple of reviews, defintely doesn't reflect the true quality of an item in most cases. We've already refunded your order, so you would have to re-order at this point.&#34;Although not totally convinced abt the faulty clasps, I will definitely reorder as they are just too cute and adorable and the price is right. <end>  Perfect Present  Bought this for a girl's birthday party gift. It is beautiful, delicate, and charming. Perfect for a tween who likes jewelry. The package was very stylish! <end>  Wonderful  I have NEVER received a bracelet from DMM that I haven't loved. They are beautiful to look at - fun to wear and are packaged to give as a gift if that is what you use it for. This is about the 10th bracelet I've purchased from them for myself and gifts and have never been disappointed. <end>  review  It as a very nice bracelet. It was shorter than i expected but it was very pretty and the box was beautiful. <end>  Beautiful  This little bracelet with a little saying with is is beautiful. Good price, good product. I bought this as a gift but am tempted to get one for myself. <end>  Happy  This was a very nice gift my friends love it. I will buy more for my other friends love them <end>  Awesome  I ordered several of these for friends and they all loved them. I was surprised as to the quality of the jewelery and how well made they were. <end>  Great Gift/Wonderful Customer Service  I love the bracelets! i purchased 3 of them as presents for family members and friends. USPS had problems with the packages getting lost and taking two long to ship so after contacting the company, Stacy was VERY helpful and understanding! she did everything she could to make sure the errors with USPS were corrected! If i had more time to purchase more products from them before the holidays, i would! shipping time after errors were corrected were around 3-5 days. <end>  Bracelet lovely but box was crushed during shipping!  Bought as a gift for my friend in UK! I love the quality & look of the bracelet and the poem too!But, the lovely gift box was mashed all up and torn during shipping!very disappointed in shipping quality but not bracelet. <end>  Thank You!  This was a great birthday gift for my sister. She absolutly loved it and it came right on time. She had a great b-day Thank you! <end>
 B000NZV9FM  XPY 14k Gold Heart Devil Diamond Pendant (.05 ct) ||	  Great piece of jewelry!  I got this for my girlfriend for our one-year anniversary, and she loved it! It's a quality piece of jewelry, and a clearly awesome design. As other reviewers have mentioned, the gold chain is a bit thin, but that hasn't caused us any problems.I'd highly recommend this piece if you're looking for something a little different, yet still want a quality piece of jewelry. <end>  Cute, but not worth what I paid.  The necklace is MUCH smaller than I anticipated but still very cute. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions because it doesn't seem worth what I paid now that I have seen it in person. The chain is very delicate and isn't strong enough for daily wear. I'd recommend getting a strong chain if you plan on wearing this for more than special occasions. <end>  good quaily, a bit small  I agree with most of the reviews on here, it is a cool idea and goog looking piece of jewelry, but it is a bit smaller than i expected. You really have to get up close to it to even notice the tail and horns. <end>  Great product  Yes, the necklace is a bit on the small/delicate side. However, when you consider the novelty aspect of this necklace, you dont want it to seem too childish - which would come across if the necklace were any bigger/thicker. The chain is beautiful, as is the actual pendant. When people notice the necklace, they get the humor right away. But you dont want it to become a distraction to everyone on the street/office. I think the size is perfect. <end>  Exactly as described  Bought this for my wife as a gift. It fit her personality. It's not High Fashion nor an eirloom, but it's a fun everyday pice of jewelry. <end>  Cool necklace  I bought this for my wife for valentine's day. I thought it was neat and she loved it too. Like others have said its smaller than it looks. I was expecting it to be small but in the picture it also looks thicker which in reality its very thin, which is what I think everyone is referring to it looking smaller. It still looks great, very unique to a normal everyday necklace. I am deducting a star for quality because a diamond fell out of it shortly after she got it and its not like she wears it everyday. <end>  a little small but nice  i purchased this for my girlfriend for valentines day and she loves it. i think its a little small. if they offered one a little bigger id buy it. if she is petite it will really look good, and its a good conversation piece.i also purchased the imitation ruby heart offered on amazon. it is a little bigger and really looks good. <end>  14k Gold Heart Devil Diamond Pendant  I bought mine on sale. For the price I paid, ($69.99) it was a bargain. The chain is VERY delicate, and should be replaced by a heavier chain. As others have stated, it is a little smaller that it looks, but still very nice. I like it. <end>  Pendant was nice but the chain was flimsy  I purchased this item for my wife as a Valentines present.She really liked it but later complained that the chain's clasp was VERY hard to open and close. I tried to put it on her myself and found it so small that even though I could see it clearly it was hard to get it to open and join it with the loop. I will get her a new chain but it will be hard because the loop on the heart is so small that it can only handle a very thin chain which also meens a small clasp. <end>  Worth it  I got this for my girlfriend as a gift. She thought it was great. As others have said it fit her personality and is a conversation starter. For the price it is worth it. <end>  Looks better in picture  The pendent it self is ok, just a bit small. The necklace is extremely small and looks very easy to break.If it wasn't for an inside "joke", between myself and my girlfriend, I would have sent it back. <end>  A great necklace for the "bad gal" within!  I got this for Christmas from my boyfriend and love it. I'm usually not into gold jewelry, but this is a very tasteful and adorable necklace. Perfect for the woman who you love despite her bad side. The chain is well made but very delicate, so if you expect that the wearer might need a stronger chain that's good to know. <end>  COOL PENDANT  This thing is smaller than it seems but it's so cool very unique & i love it. <end>  I love it  I received this beautiful pendant from my husband for Valentine's Day. I have had many compliments on it. The pendant is just the right size for me. It's not huge and not to small you can clearly see the detail of the horns and tail. <end>  way too small  This item is way to small about the size of a nickel. I bought it for my wife and she returned it. <end>  Perfect  Great price, great look, and after 4yrs it still looks great and gets tons of people wanting to talk about it. <end>  My wife loved it!  Purchased for my wife a couple of years back and she loved it when she opened it. I love her dearly but she is a little devil. Luckily she knows it. This is little smaller than I thought it would be, but very nice regardless. <end>  Too cute!  This is such a cute little necklace! I love it! A few of the reviews made me a bit worried it wouldn't be nice but it is so nice, especially for the price. It's tiny, but really I'd feel silly if it were much bigger because it's nice and subtle at this size. Also the diamonds are all a nice clear colour so I don't know what one of the people who reviewed it meant by some of the diamonds being darker than others. All in all this is a lovely little necklace at a good price and I am very happy with it! <end>  14k Gold Heart Devil Diamond Pendant (.04 ct)  My wife loves it but I think she just says that so as not to say your cheap. The item is cute however she wears a cross pendant too that is not very big and this thing looks like a small version of what one should be. Micro-sized.When selling jewelry they should be forced to show actual size photos. The chain is so thin and the hole is so small that you can not put a heavier chain on to replace the junky one that comes with it. <end>  Love It!  As I read in some other reviews, the chain is thin. I went to a pawn shop and found the perfect gold chain for it (although it was a bit tricky to attach) and now I absolutely love the necklace. It is delicate, so you need to be careful. <end>  FANTASTIC!  I tell you all, this has to be the best thing I have ever purchaced for my wife! She loves it! She has had it now for over a year and its still 100% perfect! Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic! It attracts more attention than any of her other jewlery (say that for this price about anything else? I think not!) even more than her jewlery from Mirano Italy! If there were earrings to match I would get them for her in a heartbeat! <end>  Delicate is an understatement  I wound up returning this item the same day it arrived. I was buying it for myself because it looked so cute. Yeah it is - if you're about 14 years old. It is way too small for an adult. The detail is nice, but good luck seeing any diamonds unless you're planning on also wearing a jeweler's glass along with it. <end>  Gracie's Gift  Every year my dog gets me a gift for christmas. This year she showed great taste when she bought me the diamond heart devil horn necklace.It is a sweet, dainty little necklace that says alot about both her and my personality. I love it!I advise any dog to purchase this for their housemate. <end>  14k gold heart devil pendant  Its very small in size and very fragil and the tail part gets snugged on things. <end>  devilish  Is devilish but very, very small. Should have paid more attention to size. Chain useless. Not worth the money. <end>  This is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This product is too small,if christmas wasnt just around the corner it would have got sent back. I dont sugguest you get it, especially for $70 dollars <end>  Cute!  I received this as a Christmas present from my husband, after having hinted around a little. It is extremely cute, well-made, and unusual. It's subtle implication of just a little devilishness is clever. A pretty piece to wear for almost any occasion (except maybe church?). It comes with a very delicate gold chain which I would temporarily change with a stronger one, depending on the occasion. Love it! <end>  Makes a great gift  Not only is it cute and dainty but it's a great conversation piece. Every time I wear it I get compliments and am asked where I got it. <end>  pretty and cute  This item is very pretty and got a lot of laughs, I think because it fit her personality so well. It has a very thin chain but seems tough enough. <end>  Fast Shipping!  I ordered it two days ago on free super saver shipping (which usually takes longer) and was very suprised when it arrived today. It's cute and even though the chain it comes on is thin - I like that because it puts more emphasis on the pendant itself. As you can tell from the photo - some diamonds are quite dark so it doesn't look like an expensive piece but I got it on sale[..] <end>  pretty!  I got this for my "devilish" daughter...it is soooo cute! Diamonds are nice and clear and it's just the perfect size. I'm sure she'll love it! <end>  Very pleased!  I bought this for myself for a Christmas present because I found it as a "today's special". Although it is very small, much smaller than it looks on the picture, I think it's adorable! The diamonds are very sparkly and the design is so unique. My only wish is that the chain was thicker and the clasp was bigger. It's almost impossible to hook it on yourself. I had to get help because I never could get it on. <end>  Devil Diamond Pendant  The pendant is smaller than you'd think, but it is nice. The only problem I have is that one of the holes to run the chain through is too small for anything to go through it. My heart hangs at an angle as a result. I could return it and request a replacement, but it's not really worth doing that. <end>  Devil with a Heart  Darling little piece. It is a bit smaller "in person" than what I expected (who really has a ruler handy to measure dimensions given??) but I'm still very pleased with its size. It's perfectly sized for a petite adult or even a tween or teenager. It's simple, yet unique without being "gaudy". And I'm SURE it will be quite a conversation piece. I can't wait to wear it! <end>  Not a happy camper  I was not happy with the Gold Heart Devil Diamond Pendant because the pendant (as you can see in the picture) was not centered with the chain. If Amazon would purchase a different one that looked better than I would purchase it again. Thanks Monya <end>  super cute!!!!!!!  it is small......but once you put it one,you will fall in love.wear it alot just for the conversation sometimes <end>
 B000NZV9JS  14k Yellow Gold Lab-Created Ruby Heart Devil Pendant with Diamond-Accent ||	  MUCH smaller than the picture makes it appear, but lovely nonetheless  First, I'm very pleased with the shipping speed of this item. I ordered on Wednesday and it was delivered the following Monday. The necklace itself is very beautiful and looks exactly as the picture. However, it is much smaller than I anticipated. I was expecting it to be around the size of a nickel but it is nowhere near that. I can't think of anything to compare the size of the necklace but it is even smaller than a dime, if that helps. If I had really considered the specs that Amazon provides, of course, I would have realized that it would not be as big as the picture makes it appear. I'm still very pleased with the item because I feel like it may have been bordering on tacky if it was too large. It is small enough that you have to look closely to observe the cute devil horns - from far away it just looks like a pretty ruby necklace. It is really dainty and delicate and I am thoroughly pleased with this necklace. My one gripe is that the chain is EXTREMELY tiny and fragile. I have never seen such a teensy chain on a necklace! I'm considering replacing the chain with a sturdier one because I am afraid it will break at any time and I will lose this gorgeous pendant. One light tug and I fear the chain will snap immediately. Other than that, I am very pleased with my purchase and recommend this necklace enthusiastically! <end>  Great Pendant!  My husband just bought me this pendant for Christmas, and it is gorgeous! The ruby is a deep red with excellent sparkle, the horns make for a unique piece, and the gold chain is very dainty. Some of the other reviews make the ruby sound very small - but the dimensions listed match the product I received. I really love this pendant, and recommend it! <end>  Chipped and cheap.  I could not wait to get this, but when it came the chain was so tangled in a bag it came in it took ten minutes to fix it, I would not even bothered to untangle the chain if I had looked at the ruby first, there was a big chip on the top of the heart. I had the thing wrapped and ready to ship back in 5 minutes, I was so mad. I will never buy any jewelry again online. <end>  The Devil Made Me Do IT!  I sent my sweetheart a link to this last Valentine's Day and he bought it for me (Whatta guy!). I put it on my own gold chain and have worn it daily ever since. I get tons of compliments on it and the funny thing is, most people don't see the horns until I point them out. I recently bought some earring to compliment this necklace. I didn't think I would wear it daily, but I love it THAT much! This is a winner, guys! I know your sweetheart would love it (even if she doesn't email it to you!). <end>  Ruby Heart Devil!  Its even nicer than it looks in the picture! Great buy!Get one for your very own gorgeous devil! She will love it <end>  Devil Pendant Review  Love the looks of this pendant, I wear it on my earring hoops and it looks great! <end>  Big different than photo  Big different than photoIt's look very nice in photoBut in real very small!!!You need microscope to see it <end>  Price sure varies!  Sometimes it's listed for $59.95 so I thought it was overpriced at $89.95.Now they have a highly optimistic $129.95 with a "list price" of $259.95, so once again I will wait to buy.Hey, that sure is a big bunch of "9s". <end>
 B000NZWTXS  Believe, Courage, Strength Silver & Crystal Expressively Yours Bracelet ||	  Crystal & Charm Bracelet  The bracelet was exactly as shown in the picture. It comes in a lovely box with a card that has a poem written on it. My friends loved the bracelets and I am very pleased with the purchase. <end>  Perfect gift!  My dearest friend is going through a tough time and we live in different states. Although we talk on the phone, I was looking for a small, tangible something I could send to her - something she could open her dresser drawer and see each day. This bracelet filled that bill. The product picture is exactly what it looks like in the box; the presentation is great and that is what I wanted most. Great price and great sentiments I want her to remember. Perfect gift! <end>  Nice Gift  really nice gift to my colleagues at workThey truly enjoyed receiving it. Great message too.Easy gift and reasonable. <end>  bracelet  This was one of three bracelets I bought as gifts. Niceley packaged, with embellishments. A thoughtful gift for a friend. <end>  Like it  Fits just right and got the white which matches everything. Easy to attach hook. Received on time with no problems. <end>  Beautiful  Love these bracelets.. Great quality and they are beautiful. Saw them in several stores, but got a better price on the internet. Worth the money. Would order again. <end>  Thank You!  This is an awesome gift for your loved ones. I would strongly incourage people to buy this it makes a great gift. The sender does a great day job at getting the stuff on time. I ordered my stuff a day ago and I reveived it really fast. <end>  Great Gift Idea  I have a friend who is going through a lot, and I wanted to treat her to a nice little surprise so I thought I would order this to cheer her up. The item will not dissapoint, is exactly as pictured! The box it came in was lovely and ready to go for gifting, and the little poem underneath the bracelet in the box is adorable. Anyone who appreciates inspirational jewelry will love this! <end>  Nice  I am happy with the bracelet. It is attractive and a good gift for my niece just diagnosed with cancer. The message was very appropriate. <end>  Beautiful bracelet  I adore this bracelet. I'm a medical student and its a reminder to help me stay encouraged! I wear it everyday. I call it my vision bracelet. Like a vision board. <end>  Nice Surprise  After I purchased the first bracelet I was so impressed with the packaging and quality that I ordered several for holiday gifts. For the price they are amazing! <end>  I love this  I order this for my secret santa and work and I love it and so does she.. Thank you  -) <end>  SPECIAL BRACELETS  I BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THESE TO HAVE ON HAND FOR BIRTHDAYS OR WHEN A SMALL GIFT IS NEEDED. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL, HAVE A SMALL MESSAGE AND GIFT BOX. THEY ARE JUST SO FEMININE AND PRETTY. THEY CAME SO FAST I ALMOST COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. THEY ARE CALLED EXPRESSLY YOURS. I LOVE THEM AND I HOPE WHEN I HAVE GIVEN ALL AWAY I WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MORE. <end>  Love it!!  I mailed this to my sister who is struggling an addiction. She loves it. She asked me &#34; I don't even want to know how much you spent&#34; . I haven't seen it in person but she loves it!! <end>  Cute, Simple  I bought this bracelet to be part of a birthday gift for a young girl. The quality is a little less than expected (then again... considering the price...). However, it is a cute accessory and age-appropriate for a child or pre-teen. <end>  Cheap  You get what you pay for. After one week it started to turn my wrist green and the bracelet started to tarnish. <end>
 B000NZX60I  14k White Gold "Mom" Diamond and Citrine Pendant ||	  Very nice  Very beautiful necklace and pendant. 4 stars only cause its a little bit smaller as it looks on the picture, but I must tell, I absolultely LOVE IT! I'm a 11 weeks pregnant mom so i must say every mother should have something like this. <end>
 B000NZXY7S  Sterling Silver "Fortune Cookie" Charm Necklace, CH-1.9 18" ||	  Darling!  I just got it & I love it!Petite, but solid. You can tell this was hand made.I would have preferred a different chain, but I really bought it for the charm, anyway.Arrived in just a few days.So cute! <end>
 B000NZY81O  14k Diamond Butterfly Pendant (.04 ct), 18" ||	  Small but pretty  I ordered this for my wife on Wednesday and received it yesterday via free 1-day shipping (Woo hoo). When you see it in the picture, it seems to be a big pendant, but in realty it is a small pendant. Even though it is small, it captures the mind of a person (that's what happened to my wife). As for the chain it is too thin that my wife ended up making a knot out of it and i am unable to remove the knot. She thought of adding the pendant to another chain (slightly thicker than this one) but she couldn't because the clasp of the chain won't go in through the split (loop) and so she is kind of stuck with this chain until she finds an alternate. But as for the pendant, it is a charm. The diamonds are too tiny that you can hardly see them without a magnifying glass. So if you love to show off your diamonds, then this is not the one. I showed her the picture on Wednesday and she didn't care for it at first. Now that she has it in hand, she doesn't want to remove it until she hits the bed. Overall, The Yellow and white gold glitters. I guess it will until its new). <end>
 B000O1IURA  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Heart Journey Pendant ||	  Cute  These were beautiful. I bought them as the bridesmaid gifts for my sister's wedding and they were great. Although they were smaller than I thought, they were sparkly and went over great <end>
 B000O1SIGI  10k White Gold Diamond Promise Ring (1/4 cttw), Size 7 ||	  Not diamonds at all!  Today I went to Zales and randomly I decided to let them check if this ring is real diamonds or not. The result is shocking  none of the stones are real diamond, even the center ones. They are all moissonites! I bought this ring for myself to celebrate my birthday in April, which has diamonds as birthstone. Now I am definitely returning it, because my birthstone is not moissonite. What makes me even more upset is the fact that I really trusted Amazon.com. They usually have very precise description. However, how can Amazon.com sell moissonite rings as real diamond rings?? Use fake diamonds to cheat customers? Never thought that we would actually check the quality for ourselves? I am very upset with the ring and Amazon.com. <end>  Nice ring, but not all real diamond  My girlfriend loved this ring and it looks very beautiful when she wears it. Just be aware though, that the accent rings on the sides of the ring, along the split shank, are moissonite diamonds, not real diamonds. The center features real diamonds. I would still recommend this to people who want to buy a nice ring for their sweetheart. <end>  Lovely  This ring is very lovely. I later found out that it is not real diamonds, but honestly it is so pretty I don't even care. For the price I think it is worth it. <end>  Great  My girlfriend totally loved this ring, 5 star, shipping was fast and she got it at the right time. <end>  promises  it's ok. shipping was fast. almost what I expected it to look like. I'm not a big fan of white gold. <end>
 B000O21KA8  14k White Gold Pear Shaped Aquamarine and Diamond Pendant, 18" ||	  Very Nice Diamond Pendant  I purchased this pendant for my wife for our 45th wedding anniversary. I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of this item. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry and well worth the price (which was discounted). I will certainly consider purchasing other jewelry from Amazon in the future. <end>  Pretty  Bought this on sale to match a ring that I've had for awhile. It's pretty, but the chain had about a dozen knots in it. It took me a good 15 minutes to get it untangled. I wouldn't recommend wearing it on the included chain which is VERY FRAGILE. Nice pendant though. <end>  very beautiful  I brought this for my wife and she loves it and wears it often. Very beautiful. <end>
 B000O3F9HC  Genuine Rose Quartz stone cube stretch Bracelet ||	  Seems study, fits snug, and has simplistic beauty  The title pretty much sums it up, its cheap, well made and looks nice. I received my order very promptly as well. <end>
 B000O3KHL0  One of a Kind Round Shape Created Sapphire & Marquise Shape White CZ Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  It's Gorgeous  This necklace exceeded my expectations. The stones were beautiful and looked so real. It looked very pretty on me and was a nice complement to my navy dress. <end>
 B000O3KHWE  Unique 3.50 carats total weight Pear & Round Shape Amethyst Multi-Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Nice quality necklace  I get a lot of compliments on this necklace when I wear it. The chain is heavy enough to be sturdy, but not too bulky. The amethysts are very deep in color and have good clarity. Recommended. <end>
 B000O3KI6O  Bold & Beautiful 5.25 carats total weight Marquise & Oval Shape Multi-Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Great Necklace!  I love this piece and bought it together with the matching bracelet and earrings. The colors are rich and clear with lots of sparkle. The price I paid for the whole set was what I had paid for one gemstone necklace somewhere else. You will not be disappointed! <end>  The Photo is Right on Target  I like this piece, but I don't love it. The photo is very accurate. Both the peridot and amethyst stones are as deep in color as they appear. "In person", the peridot stones are a little deeper than I personally like. I like the style of this necklace and was hoping the peridot stones would be lighter than the photo....that amethyst drop stone in this necklace, is a thing of beauty! Peridot comes in many hues, some of the best quality peridot is very deep green, but it really isn't one of my favorites, however; it is my birthstone, so I like to wear it, sometimes. I have purchased three other pieces of peridot from Peora that I love. That said, it's a well made, quality necklace I will definitely wear. It's also, comfortable on the neck and stays in place. <end>
 B000O3KISW  Antique Style Oval Shape Created Ruby & White CZ Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful  received my first ruby necklace and it is as It looks----beautiful.

 B000O3M1UA  Gorgeous 4.00 carats total weight Pear & Round Shape Citrine & Garnet Multi-Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Very pretty  I liked the look of this necklace a lot. The citrine was a very nice dark golden, not washed out and the garnets were a crisp red, not too dark as to look black. The design was different and looked great. <end>
 B000O3M1ZU  Exceptional 3.25 carats total weight Round Shape London Blue Topaz Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Very nice  Nice large London Blue topaz. I did not keep, because the style did not match my other items closely enough. Quite dark stones. <end>
 B000O3M268  Luxurious 2.00 carats total weight Marquise Shape London Blue Topaz & White CZ Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  elegant and simple  I got this necklace as a gift for one of my older girlfiends. She has a more refined taste and loves London Blue. As soon as I saw this necklace I knew she'd love it and I was right, She totally did!She thought I spent way more than I did on this necklace, so I'm happy with the quality of the piece. <end>
 B000O3NEU6  Luxurious Marquise Shape Created Sapphire & Round Shape White CZ Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful piece !!  I love the style and color of this necklace. I wish the white cz's were a slight bit smaller, however, as they dont come across as being believable. Otherwise, this is a good quality piece of jewelry. <end>
 B000O3P3VY  Gorgeous 2.25 carats total weight Pear Shape London Blue Topaz & White CZ Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  gorgeous necklace.  I have been disappointed in the past when it comes to receiving jewelry that I ordered online but that is not he case with this necklace. The chain was a lovely quality. Both the chain and the stones sparkled incredibly. It looked like a very exquisite piece of jewelry at a bargain price. <end>
 B000O3P44A  Cleopatra Style 1.75 carats total weight Round Shape Amethyst Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Pretty, but...  It was just "okay." I sent it back, but only because I needed a special piece for a wedding. This would have fit the bill, if it weren't for the fact that it was jointed and wouldn't lay flat. Because it kept twisting and turning, you lost the look of it. Also the clasp was very small and hard to open. It took me about five minutes to get the necklace off by myself. In the end, I decided that it was a bit too "chokery" in length, and I needed something longer... maybe 18" instead of 16". So the search continues. But I have to say... if you are looking for a unique choker, this is a nice and unique piece of jewelry. The stones were nice, the purple was as pictured on-line... not pale like a lot of the amethysts you get on the net. And the silver was pretty... nice and shiny, obviously sterling. It's a good value, if that style is what you're after. <end>
 B000O3P51M  Eye catchy Pear Shape Created Sapphire & White CZ Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Lovely  This item is exactly as described. This necklace is pretty, sparkling, delicate... I wear it when I go to the theatre, for weddings, during parties  always looking good. I do really recommend this purchase because this item is elegant without being too sumptuous. <end>  Perfect  This necklace was purchased for my wedding day and it is perfect! Absolutely beautiful and a great price!!!Thank you! <end>
 B000O3PT5E  MLB Atlanta Braves Dangle Earrings ||	  Nice, but not at all as pictured  They arrived and I gave them to my girlfriend, a huge Braves fan. She opened them and immediately loved them, but they weren't at all what I ordered. The picture clearly shows the earrings having the script "Braves" over the tomahawk. What she actually got was the Atlanta letter "A" instead. She loved them anyways, but she also doesn't know its not what I ordered. They're still nice, but I'm only giving 1 star since its not what I paid for. <end>  Haute Chop...  I love my Braves Earrings. They are cute and stylish and still subtle enough to say I'm a Braves fan in public. This is a great product. GREAT, more-than-affordable price and quick shipping! <end>
 B000O3PTA4  NCAA Florida Gators Dangle Earrings ||	  Great Buy  These earring were not expensive and yet everyone who won them at the event loved them, and they still wear them to every game! <end>
 B000OB3HOQ  14k Gold Plated Engagement Ring with Ring Guard CZ Wedding Set ||	  BEAUTIFUL...!  This truly is a beautiful ring. It it just the right size for small handed, small fingered woman. It is not big, bulky and thick like most costume jewelry. <end>  not real  this product is beautiful but it isnt real gold because my ring turned in about 2 and half weeks after.crystal <end>  stolen in the mail  The ring got stolen in the mail it arrived wrapped with a plastic with a note from USPS that says they are sorry and stuff and the box was empty very frustrating <end>
 B000OB4HVI  White Freshwater Cultured Pearl and Amethyst Chip Earrings (9-10mm) ||	  not as appears on the internet  I got 2 pair they both and the pearls on both of them looked like snow men. <end>  Not as pictured... at all!  I got these because I had also purchased the green peridot which I absolutely adore.... these? The amethyst looked almost "bleached" and the two earrings doesnt evne look uniform. Barely even purple at all... I'm a bit disappointed and am still debating if I should keep it or not....I rated it 2 stars just because Amazon does have an awesome return policy and customer service.... and the earrings are okay... just not as pictured and looked like I said... bleached.. =( <end>  Simplistic  It's simplistic. I wanted something with pearls and real stones and this one fit the bill. My only dissatisfaction is that the pearls are misshapened and you can clearly tell where the center is still being rounded out - you can see these medium sized threads around the entire middle of the pearl where the oysters were still working on forming the pearl. <end>  Low quality - not as pictured  I bought these as a gift and was very disappointed when they came. The pearls looked very pathetic and had a rings around them. (The pearls were not smooth.) I returned the earrings. <end>
 B000OB68UQ  Men's 14k Two-Tone Diamond Ring (1/8 cttw, I Color, I1 Clarity), Size 10 ||	  Great looking ring for the money  I bought this ring in January 2008 and was pleased with it's appearance when it arrived. It's an expensive looking ring for an inexpensive price.It has sharp character and I have gotten many compliments on it since I starting wearing it.I highly recommend this piece. <end>
 B000ODT2RK  Sterling Silver Saint Michael The Archangel Oval-shaped Medal Pendant, 7/8 inch (23 mm) tall ||	  xmas gift  We bought several cheap ($.89) pewter versions of this pendant in Puerto Rico for my husband but he lost everyone of them because the attachment to the cord necklace was flimsy. This pendant appears sturdy and the depiction of St Michael and on the flip side of the gaurdian angel are very well done. The tarnish gives it an old look. Nice piece at a good price. <end>  Beautiful Piece St. Michael  I purchased the St.Michael Medallion and it was better than described. A nice beautiful piece of jewelry. The shipping was quick. I was extremely pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend this seller. <end>  Wonderful!  This medal is much more beautiful and well made than I was expecting. It's very nice, very high quality. It's a little more shiny than in the photo, which is good. I'm extremely glad I bought from this seller. <end>  Love this product!  This was an excellent transaction. The product was a much better quality than described or pictured and shipment was received quickly. I will definately purchase from this seller again. <end>
 B000OE7JUG  Sterling Silver Rare White Buffalo Turquoise Earrings in Heart Shape ||	  White Buffalo jewelry WOWs!  Recently I purchased the rare White Buffalo turquoise earrings for my daughter-in-law who is native American. She was very pleased with them and has been wearing them daily. They hold special significance to her almost as a religious icon. I had been looking for some time for a special gift. Thank you. <end>  She loves them.  My Honey is always looking for unusual, yet affordable earrings. These are both attractive, and inexpensive. The white turquoise is very rare, and very striking. She loves them, and I will be looking for more white turquoise jewelery. This has been a very good choice for her, and me ;) <end>
 B000OF0DKS  Catholic Rosary Beads with Crucifix Grey Beaded Silver Tone 30" Necklace ||	  This is NOT a CATHOLIC ROSARY  This is not a rosary. It is just a necklace with a crucifix and medal attached. A Catholic rosary has 5 decades ( 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys) this has no spaces to designate the Our Father from the Hail Marys. It also has 17 extra beads on the rope, and 3 extra beads on the beginningjust after the crucifix. <end>
 B000OL71RK  One of a Kind Design 6.75 carats total weight Princess & Round Cut Peridot Bracelet in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful Bracelet  I ordered this bracelet as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who was born in August. It's her birthstone. This bracelet is beautiful and everything I'd expected. I recommend this to anyone who wants a Peridot bracelet. <end>  Pale Peridot  The peridot bracelet I ordered came and I was very disappointed to find the stones were not at all like the photo. They are very pale and watery looking, hard to see that they were green. The design is wonderful, quality is good and it came promptly, but I am going to return it because I will never be happy with the nearly colorless stones. It came from Peora, SKU sb2864.Flo Philips <end>

 B000OVHU1C  Black 16 Necklace Chain Folder Jewelry Travel Showcase Display ||	  Don't recommend this jewelry folder  The folder I got didn't have 16 snaps they showed in the picture. It had only two elastic bands. Not a product I would recommend. <end>
 B000OVHVR0  100 Silver Bow Paper Gift Bags Shopping Tote Sales Bag 5 x 7" ||	  Ms. Pam  I realize the bag stated its size but I thought the bags were a little bigger. They are cute but they are too small. <end>
 B000OVHWFQ  6 Flocked Bracelet & Watch Chain Gift Boxes ||	  Much needed items  I have many uses for these flocked bracelet & watch chain gift boxes. I often purchase these items and would like to have them presented in a nice jewelry box. Great purchase for the price. <end>
 B000OVJXPS  6 Pouches Black Velvet Drawstring Jewelry Bags 5" ||	  Great for hiding things! You can't see through this bag!  What a great bag to put things in! Once you pull the drawstrings closed, the contents do not spill out! It's perfect for keeping things and hiding things because you cannot see though this black velvet! <end>  6 Pouches Black Velvet Drawstring Jewelry Bags 5"  These are great black velvet pouches that you can use for a lot of things. You can store not only jewelry but other personable items that you make want to protect in your dresser drawer. <end>  Good product  I needed a bag to hold my ear buds. For some reason, my cat likes to chew them the second I bring them home from the store. These bags are exactly as advertised, and would work great for anyone needing this type of product. Would buy again. <end>  Nice pouches  "I bought these bags for 2 gifts, bracelets for my nieces; they are as described and seem durable. They are typical jewelry pouches. They worked for me. They came faster than I expected and were packaged well. I was satisfied with this purchase and would order from this seller again." <end>  el mejor precio en internet  Completamente satisfecha con el produco y el precio, todo llego de manera corecta y el envio fue super rapido.Definitivamnete volveria a comprar estas bolsitas. <end>  Great for holding gifts  I purchased these pouches to hold the gifts for my bridesmaids before my wedding. The pouches look nice and seem to be good quality. They worked well for my purposes, but since I just used them once, I can't comment to how well they would hold up over time. <end>  Nice Quality Bags  I purchased these bags and received them promptly and am very happy with my purchase! I make Jewelry and plan to custom embroider the bags for uses in shipping out my earrings! I really wish that they sold them in a bulk set. I thought 10.00 was expensive for 6 bags found another place on here with more bags for the same price. They did not list the size of the bags so I think I will stick with this seller. the bags were of a nice thickness and quality I would rate as a solid 10. <end>  incorrect description  The description for this product says the bags are 4 1/4" by 5", however the bags are actually 2 1/2" by 3". Should have read the reviews first as someone else has complained about the same thing. <end>  Good product for an amazing price  I use the drawstring bags for board games, a lot of which require you to draw tokens or items without being able to see them. The bags are on the smallish side, and the material isn't the nicest, but it is sturdy and for about $1.50 a bag you really couldn't find a more cost effective substitute. <end>  17 out of 18 is pretty good I guess...  I ordered 3 packs of these bags to store some silver items to help prevent them from tarnishing. They shipped as expected, in a very timely manner, and the items were just as described as far as size and quality. I was quite pleased until I was almost to the end of the task of bagging up my items and wondered why I still had an item remaining and no bags... One of the packages only had 5 pouches rather than the 6 that should have been contained in the pack. Oh well. <end>  4.5 inch by 3.5 inch  What you expect for a few dollars. Material isn't fancy. Biggest complaint is the false advertisement; its actally 4.5 inch by 3.5 inch. I would of ordered a differnt set if I knew about this. <end>  Great For Jewelry or Anything Else...  Actually bought two packs, I use them whenever I give a small gift to someone (man or woman). Makes it more personal and they tend to appreciate it even more so. Best investment I ever made. Great quality. ABM. <end>  Cheap good bags  Overall good quality, great for the price. They are not 5&#34; but I knew that from reading the other reviews. <end>  problem solved  The bags are nice as expected, however, I am writing a review to give a special kudos to the distributor, FindingKing. I received a set of smaller sized bags than ordered. I needed the 5" bags for packaging brides' maids gifts; time was of essence. Rather than try to hassel with the regular route of return-reorder with Amazon,I called the distributor directly and their customer service dept very kindly and quickly remedied the problem. I could not have received better service anywhere. Thank you very much. I will definitely do business with FindingKing again and I highly recommend them to others. Thanks again!! <end>  Wrong Items Sent  I ordered the 5" bags and received 3" bags. I had to return the items due to the size. I am disappointed that they were not able to send the correct bags. <end>  great for what I needed  I needed these for Sunday School lessons and they did the trick and the children love them. They are well worth the small cost. <end>  Does what it need to do.  I use these to store knickknacks when travelling. Specially useful for little items like adapters that easily get lost when not bagged together. <end>
 B000OVJYU2  Black Velvet Chain Roll Up 20 Snaps Travel Display ||	  Just what I wanted  Exactly what I wanted - Nice material, holds a ton load of chains, so far the snaps seem sturdy and well made <end>  Almost what I wanted  I have extensively searched for a necklace travel case, and this is the best I could find. It holds many necklaces, each by their own snap clasp at the top of the case. Even though I pack carefully, when I arrive at my travel destination, I find that the bottoms of the necklaces have become entwined, causing me to spend my precious vacation time detangling my necklaces.The only means I have found to circumvent this problem once I have reached my destination is to hang the necklace holder on a clip hanger in the closet of my hotel or stateroom, so that the necklaces hang free.My suggestion to this company would be to manufacture this product with snaps at both the top and the bottom of the roll. If they did, I would be the first on line to buy one. <end>  Black Velvet Chain Roll up 20 Snaps Travel Display  Good product but if they make more snaps on the bottom too that will be perfect to hold the necklaces. <end>
 B000OVJZBK  4 Black Flocked Earring Gift Boxes Jewelry Box ||	  BOXES!  Heck yes. These four boxes made it super easy to give my sisters & mom earrings & stuff that I had ordered multiple pairs of through Groupon for Christmas. And it looked all fancy n' s***. <end>
 B000OVK370  Black Velvet Necklace Pendant Gift Box With Brass Trim ||	  Absolutely perfect  Very, very pretty box. Gave my girlfriend a necklace in it, and she loved it - she even commented on the box itself. Exceeds expectations. <end>  Perfect!  This box is perfect! It looks expensive, like it came with the pretty necklace I got to put in it. Perfect! <end>  Beautiful and Elegant Jewelry Gift Box.  This was exactly what I needed for a recent purchased of a beautiful necklace. The brass trim and black velvet accent any piece of jewelry. It is a beautiful and elegant jewelry gift box that will make the receiver very happy! <end>  Surprisingly well made necklace box  I needed a box for a necklace destined to be a gift and had rather low expectations for this unit. Boy was I wrong. This is a very well made little box of decent heft. The hinge is straight, the black velvet exterior and gold-toned metal strip are well fit and finished. Open it up and you will find an up-angled black velvet trapezoidal display "shelf" that holds the pendant or necklace up for display. The lining on the lid's interior resembles a white satin-type fabric with a perfectly centered x-shaped pucker that really looks nice. Assuming they are all built like this you can't go wrong. If I ever need a similar box I'm buying another with no hesitation. <end>  Very pretty & elegant.  Purchased this to hold a necklace I purchased from a discount site. I didn't want to pay full price just to have a pretty box for the same item. Purchasing this separately allowed me to purchase more gifts for my family,while still presenting the items in professional packaging. <end>  Beautifully Made Box  I ordered this box for a pendant necklace I purchased from a relative who has collected jewelry for over fifty years. The necklace looks great in it, and the box is handsome and well made. I have ordered another one of these boxes that is fitted for a ring I purchased. I am very very pleased. <end>  Did the job well.  This little box came quickly and the material was rather comfortable to the touch. Nothing fancy or too special but rather classy. I used to hold a necklack and the gift receiver seemed to love it. Cheers! <end>  Love these boxes  I got these to put some Christmas presents in. They are beautiful. Just like the picture and it doesn't disappoint you a bit. I just wish I knew something else I got required a box, I would of gotten more. Very classy item. <end>  Velvet Jewelry Case  Lovely velvet box. Just right to put a pretty pendant in for a Christmas gift. Arrived in a timely manner. <end>  Very nice  Good quality, nice materials, no logos & decent price. I had to cut in another pair of notches at the top to keep my pendant from moving around in the box too much. I also had to tape the chain down behind to keep it from sliding around to the front. A little pouch behind the display area would have prevent the need to get creative. But even with my crafty work, it still looks great. Made the gift really stand out! <end>  worth the money  excellent product, great quality, if your deciding between ordering this or getting one from a jewlery store get this, they tend to charge like $20 for some fo leather crap, but this really made the pendant i got for my girlfriend pop, it feels nice too, with good quality brass trim <end>  Great gift box, compliments jewelry well.  I bought this gift box to replace the one I had originally received with a necklace I bought at the jewelers. The one I had looked "cheap" even though the jewelry I had bought was rather expensive. I decided to look online for a nice looking gift box and found this. I was surprised when first opening it at the very nice appearance of the product. The pictures don't do it justice. It also seems to be of good quality. I put a gold necklace that I bought my girlfriend inside of it and gave it to her for Christmas. She loved the necklace and the box complimented it well. The brass around the gift box went every well with the gold necklace. Definitely an improvement over the standard box I got at the jewelers. <end>  Amazing  I was looking for a gift box so that I could put a necklace I bought for my girlfriend in it and this was perfect. Really good quality and doesn't have any logos. <end>  Works great for necklaces  This works in a pinch when jewelers or online sales do not include them. Not sure why jewelers would not include such a box for an additional couple of bucks. <end>  Nice Boxes Good Price  Bought these to replace the cheap looking boxes that come with most of the jewelry I've been buying. These boxes are nicely made and have a elegant appearance. They worked great and I was able to find matching boxes for rings, earrings and necklaces <end>  excellent small gift box  excellent small gift box - well made and makes the enclosed pendant look first class - look no further for a small gift box <end>  very nice  Bought it for a pendant necklace to give as as a gift. Made it look very nice. High quality construction. <end>  Very Nice For the Money  Some necklaces come with no gift box or one that is not that impressive. So, if you want to impress someone, this box looks very nice and presents any necklace pendant perfectly, so the receiver will surely be pleased. <end>  Beautiful presentation  I bought my sister a pretty necklace via Groupon, but it arrived in a plastic bag. Fair enough, considering the deal I got on it, but certainly not suitable to gift in. I was happy to find that you can get jewelry boxes like this via Amazon, and it made for a much more dramatic and elegant gift, as if I'd bought it in a jewelry store. If I buy a necklace for anyone again, you can bet I'll be picking up another box like this for the gifting. <end>
 B000OVNLJW  12 Silver Metal Earring Dancer Jewelry Showcase Display Stands 3.25" ||	  Love em...  They're so cute,,, I just love 'em. Gave some to my grand daughters, 10 and 8. They got all excited to hang their earrings as quickly as possible... Thanks guys!! <end>
 B000OVNSOA  15 Slot Gemstone Display Tray Diamond Jewelry Showcase ||	  Handy and portable  Minerologists will like this portable carrier for gemstones. Just be careful not to bump it while it is open because nothing is holding the stones down, so you may wind up picking them up off the floor. The white material really makes the colors pop. <end>
 B000OVPBBS  5 Black 8 Slot Pocket Watch Jewelry Display Case Tray Inserts ||	  Multi-purpose and just great  I got these trays, not for watch display, but for displaying my crafts in the showcase. It gives me a nice background, has that nice felt-like material to keep my items save and with the compartments, I can tilt it without things falling all over the place. Then I decided to use it for my own collections like seashells and it makes my collection more beautiful. I liked the sturdiness of the trays and I had 5 to use which really helped with savings. I think anyone could benefit from these great trays. (oh yea pocket watches too...LOL)A great buy, great product, and a fast shipper <end>
 B000OVPG40  Roll Up Ring Chain Bracelet Combo Travel Display ||	  my wife loves it  my wife loves this. got i t for her for christmas. she can keep all her jewelry in it when we travel . rings, bracelets, necklaces, ear rings, there's a place for all these items. pretty good deal for the price if you ask me. <end>  nice  This roll-up travel jewelry tote is exactly what I needed for traveling. It holds a LOT of jewelry and keeps it mostly untangled. The fabric is soft and thick enough. The description doesn't really say, but it doesn't really roll up, but rather folds in thirds, which is actually nicer for fitting in your luggage or carry-on. You can hold rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets and watches. Some of the snaps are too tight and will pull right through the fabric if you're not careful! Other than that, it's a great piece. <end>
 B000OVPIF2  Black Bracelet Watch Gift Box Jewelry Display New ||	  Very nice gift box  Bought this for a bracelet I bought which came in a bag. The gift box is very nice and shows off the bracelet to it's best. <end>
 B000OWF1TY  Genuine Freshwater Cultured White Pearl Aventurine Stone Chip stretch Bracelet ||	  Beautiful  The freshwater pearls and the aventurine are so beautiful together. I will be keeping my eyes out for more jewelery in this combination. I like the stretch chip bracelets and found this one to have enough stretch that I can easily get it on or off. Really, just too beautiful for the price they are selling it for. For those into gemstone lore - aventurine is a good career stone for those in stressful situations at work and acts as a shield against "energy vampires" who like to tap in and use the energy of other people. It also reinforces ones decision making abilities and amplifies leadership qualities. <end>  They'll Be Green with Envy...  ..when your show up with a couple of these beauties around your wrist. Large, highly polished chips contrast beautifully with the snowy white pearls. At a price that can't be beat for the quality, at least one of these should show up in every woman's or girl's Xmas stocking you have to fill! <end>
 B000OWKZFY  14K White Gold Diamond Semi Mount Engagement Ring ||	  Ring but no stone  Well all I really have to sy is that this is a gorgeous ring. I know for a fact that my soon to be fiance is going to love this ring. I showed all of her friends and they seem to love it. The only thing i have against this is the fact that there was no Diamond. It didnt specify but it would be best to have a really good description, in regards to how the ring will come in the little blue box <end>
 B000OWL8G4  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 7-7.5 Inches 6-7mm Black Freshwater Cultured Pearl Bracelet ||	  More than I anticipated, an incredible find!

The price is honestly too good of a deal for such a well-put-together item. <end>

 B000OXDKGO  14K Rose Gold Diamond Ring ||	  Not as advertised visually!  I ordered this ring expecting it to be as pictured, but what was delivered didn't match either the visual nor written description! I got a thin "Yellow Gold" ring! Not the "Tricolored" Gold ring as pictured, and not the "Rose" Gold ring as described! Needless to say I am having my wife return this as soon as possible! <end>
 B000OXE266  14K White Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl & Diamond Ring ||	  she loves it  the ring is beautiful. its a bit smaller than i imagined but she didnt mind. i was kinda disappointed with the fact that the company wouldnt change the ring size and said if i did my warranty would be voided. but i had to since i was wrong about the size  ( <end>
 B000OZX1JS  Sonic Jewelry Cleaner by Medelco ||	  Sonic Electric Jewelry Cleaner Machine  I bought this as a gift for my mom and she said she loved it! She said all her jewelry is clean and sparkley again.It was lightweight and a perfect size for countertop use. <end>  jewelery cleaner  A bit noisy when turned on, but it does the job and leaves your gemstones sparkling clean. <end>  Item arrived dirty!  My jewelry cleaner arrived with dark streaks all around the sides from the cardboard box it came in. It looked like there was newpaper ink inside the box. I couldn't get it to come off, so mine looks pretty nasty. The unit itself seems very cheaply made and it is very noisy when running. My jewelry was only slightly cleaner after using it. I would have returned it, but the shipping would be almost as much as it cost. I will probably throw it away instead. <end>
 B000OZXYWC  Silver Plated Childs Piggy Money Bank ||	  Perfect Gift For A Co-Worker's Baby  If you don't socialize outside of the office, it is often hard to know what kinds of gifts to buy for the people that you work with. This was the PERFECT Gift! Not to personal, priced right & received a huge thank-you fromBarbara (my co-worker). Thanks so much. This is now my standard "New Baby" Gift. <end>  Great Baby Shower Gift  Bought this for a baby shower present and it was just a big hit. It is so adorable. I am very happy I found this piggy bank. I received amazing service and it came in no time and was very well packaged. <end>  my little cousins loved this  I bought this as a Christmas gift for one of my little cousins and he loved it. The piggy bank is just a classic children's item, and this one in particular looks great with its eye opening shine. I could not be any happier with my purchase. Harris Michael took really good care of me and shipped it out to me quickly. <end>
 B000P0LI8S  We Love You Mom Charm 14k Gold 16mm ||	  nice but to small to read  i bought this as a chrismas gift for my mother ,but product not correct size .i expected 16mm but when came stated size was 11mm .had to keep trying different angles to try to read charm. <end>
 B000P0LUQS  Men's Titanium 7mm Plain Wedding Band with 18k Yellow Gold Accents, Size 10 ||	  He loved it!  I wanted to find a unique ring for proposing to my boyfriend. He said yes, even though he believes only a man should propose. The shipping was faster than its estimated date. The fit was also perfect, I ordered a size 10. He really enjoys the fact that it does not look like a traditional wedding band. He has a love for tree houses and has built a few and the screw head accents made me think of him when I purchased the ring.  -) <end>
 B000P0N9G2  Puffed Heart Charm 14k White Gold 8mm ||	  14K puffed heart charm  The heart was in excellent condition when it arrived, however, it was way smaller than I wanted. I would have loved it to be larger. It shows on the computer to be larger than it really was. <end>
 B000P0QX5Q  Virgin Mary Charm Painted 14K Gold 19.5mm ||	  Just Lovely  Item image and description are perfect. I was looking for a St. Mary charm and fell in love with this one immediately. When I opened it, I was just as pleased. The charm was received quickly and packaged well. <end>
 B000P0QXMY  Crucifix Charm Sterling Silver 30mm ||	  good service, exact description  Sterling Silver Crucifix Charm Religious Cross 30mmThis seller gives an adequate description of the product. And service is excellent (my order was delivered to Turkey within a few days!). <end>
 B000P0R49U  Edward Mirell Men's Polished Titanium Barrel 7mm Plain Wedding Band, Size 12 ||	  Style and Imagination at a fraction of the cost of a mall store  After getting engaged, I had to start the task of finding a wedding ring that had some style, imagination, masculine, and was comfortable. I did my homework and searched all of the recommended specialty jewelry shops and just couldn't come up with anything different that had any slight amount of imagination. They all carried the standard same old designs with slight differences from each other but nothing inspirational so it was extremely disapointing. I was very discouraged and about ready to give in and buy a standard common and expensive wedding band until finding this ring on Amazon as a last effort.Since purchasing this ring, I have found the exact same ring selling at other jewelry stores for over $500 (on sale). The selection at Amazon was absolutely amazing, bordering overwhelming, but it did end a lot of searching. Although I hate wearing jewelry, I found this ring to be very comfortable to wear and durable so it can take typical everyday abuse.No need to drive from store to store only to spend hundreds more for less selection. For the same price as the closest mall was charging, I was able to get three, since I have a habit of losing them, and still have enough left over to have one engraved. The only difference is it appears gold colored on the web page but is actually more of a brushed nickel color when they arrived. <end>  Quality Ring and Nice Looking but too Thick for Small Hands  I originally bought this to replace an extremely heavy platinum band. It's a nice looking ring but it is way too thick for my hand. I'm not complaining about the top-down view thickness (7mm), I'm referring to the thickness from the finger to the top of the ring (from the top of the inner ring to the base, where the finger slides through). It is 4mm thick.Ring Review + Good Quality+ Nice Looking- Too thick (for small hands)If you have small hands like I do (from base to top of the middle finger measurement = 8 inches), I do not recommend this ring. <end>  Picture is Slightly Deceiving  The ring is still gorgeous, but when I got it in the mail, the finish wasn't quite like the picture. This makes it look like a brushed nickel sort of surface; it's more of a mirror finish. Still pretty, and I didn't mind, but not exactly as the picture shows. <end>  First Observations/Thoughts  I have been looking at this style of ring for awhile. Not for a wedding band, but something to wear. I was about to buy this ring on another website where they say to buy only Edward Mirell and not cheap knockoffs, but decided to check Amazon first. I was taking a chance since this ring was about 150 dollars less, but upon receiving the ring it is stamped Edward Mirell. The only difference I can see between this ring and the other ring is that the barrels are not connected to the sides with little strips of titanium. Maybe this is an early version of the ring that Amazon is trying to sell off at a low price?The ring is handsome, seems perfect. I got a size 11 and the ring does seem to run big. I am able to make it work though. It is light like a titanium ring should be. The cable is awesome. The thickness of the ring is what I will have to get used too. The titanium part of the ring is thick, then the rope sticks out above the ring, and then the barrels are even higher. I can definitely feel it on my hand right now, but hopefully I will get used to it.I'm going to be pessimistic and say that this ring won't hold up for a long time. It seems really solid, but I have to wonder how long the cable will hold together. I will update my review if something happens, hopefully it will remain as awesome as day one. <end>  its not exact the way it looks in the picture, well my suggestion to every one is do not buy any thing by just looking @ the pic  well I was not happy when i received it b'coz it did not look the same the way they show in the picture..............buying stuff from Amazon is a big problem they dont have the direct contact number from where ever you are buying so that if for some reason you dont like it you can call them and tell them about it or you can send it back...........so may be I will stop ordering stuff from amazon I would like to talk to a live person where ever I'm getting my stuff from and their is no contact number ever and you wont know where your order is comming from <end>  Broken before two years of marriage!  I bought this ring for my husband as his wedding band. It is a beautiful ring and we both liked it a lot. Less than two years later the cable in the middle BROKE and fell out of the ring. I was under the impression that the entire band was made of titanium, but apparently the center piece is steel. This is no good for a man who works with his hands all day handling heavy packages.Now I'm in the market for a new ring. Very irritating. <end>  the best ring for the money  I am very happy that I picked that particular ring, my grandson was estatic with it,and all of his friends are green with envy!!sincerely,Sandra Alfrey <end>  Ring ok... but a cheap knockoff  This ring is like one we saw at a jeweler, but a cheaper version. It was probably worth the price, but not a great deal like we thought it was. I returned it. <end>
 B000P1PMRK  Bicycle Ear Studs ||	  VERY BAD  I never received this item. They say the USPS left a note and held it at the post office, but I cannot find the package. VERY bad. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. <end>
 B000P34CAQ  Sterling Silver Cute Butterfly Design Toe Ring Animal Toering ||	  Nicer than I thought  When this arrived, I was disappointed, and did not think it nearly as pretty as the picture. But as I wore it, I decided it showed up very nicely. I am now quite pleased with it. <end>
 B000P3ABMY  Sterling Silver Elegant Pearl Drop CZ Earrings ||	  very pretty  The earrings are lovely to wear and very light on the ears. Kate Middleton wore similar earrings that cost over $100 and these earrings are pretty much on par with the more expensive earrings. I enjoy wearing them. <end>
 B000P3B0EC  Sterling Silver Cute Butterfly Design Toe Ring ||	  Butterflies Are Definitely On Demand For Your Toes  Cute Butterfly Design Toe Ring Sterling Silver Animal ToeringVery pretty little toe ring. I've never purchased a toe ring before and this is my first purchase of one. Of course, since I love butterflies, I thought this one would be perfect. Man, was I right. It's sterling silver and I can get my feet wet and not worry about my toe turning green or black because of poor quality silver. Definitely a must have. <end>  perfect  This item is perfect for anyone who likes butterflies and it is very detailed and actually looks just like the picture! <end>  Karen of NY  I bought this toe ring for my niece. The ring is gorgeous! It is solid and beautifully crafted. Plus, it came in an adorable gift box with bow. I highly recommend any sterling silver rings from this seller. I bought four rings and all are of extraordinary quality. <end>
 B000P3CFCS  Exquisite Vintage Style CZ Freshwater Pearl Drop Earrings ||	  Looks Cheap  These earrings don't have much sparkle and look a little on the 'cheap' side. Very disappointed in them - they were returned. <end>
 B000P3CIEI  Large Stainless Steel Dog Tag Necklace ||	  Very Nice Necklace  I was very happy with the quality of this item for the price. It's really attractive and has some weight to it -- not cheap at all. It also engraves beautifully. <end>
 B000P3EXPK  Designer Style Champagne CZ Cocktail Ring with Gold Accents ||	  Champagne  Designer Style Champagne CZ Cocktail Ring with Gold AccentsThis ring was a wonderful purchase; it was just as described. I love it. It was a little larger than I expected, but it is beautiful and wears beautifully! Thanks you. <end>
 B000P3FA20  Princess Cut Created Ruby & White CZ Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  As Pretty As The Picture  This necklace is such a beautiful design and it looks just as pretty as the picture! Unfortunately, I was needing something with a red stone, and when the necklace came, the stone really looks hot pink, so it didn't work out for me, as I was looking for necklaces for my bridesmaids for a red & purple wedding. But aside from that small problem, it's really very pretty! <end>  Beautiful  I love this necklace. Unfortunately, I am allergic to the metals in it and can't wear it that often. <end>
 B000P3HD9I  1.25 carats total weight Princess Cut & Round Shape Peridot Multi-Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Pretty but cheap looking  This necklace is meant for a 10-year old, which is the only reason why I will let its cheap look slide. The stone itself looks very pretty, and so does the arrangement and design, but the silver part looks really unattractive. <end>
 B000P3HDF2  0.50 carats total weight Princess Cut London Blue Topaz & White CZ Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  review of London Blue necklace  The color and sparkle of this necklace was even more intense than the photo. I chose it for a gift and the giftbox was so lovely that I didn't need to wrap it. Choose it for an adult, though. The place where the chain connects with the main part of the necklace could be easily broken. Really a gorgeous gift, though. <end>  very classy  Much prettier than the picture, stone beautiful deep blue color. Beautifully boxed for gift giving. Prompt delivery <end>
 B000P3JHCO  2.00 carats total weight Princess Cut & Round Shape Garnet Multi-Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Vintage Appeal in the Design  This one sparkles. It's very reflective. The 7 stones scattered throughout this piece are small(3mm), clear and brilliant. The drop princess stone is about a carat and has lots of fire and depth. The stones have a deep, rich, bordeaux color. The attached chain is substantial. It's smooth and very comfortable on the neck. The necklace lies nicely and stays put.I use to sell fine jewelry, so I have a habit of examining each piece I buy, under the loupe. My "hats off" to Peora's craftsmens, they do superior work. Silver is a precious metal. It's not as rare as gold or platinum; but it is rare. Peora shows an appreciation and respect for this metal in the quality of their designs, workmanship and stones. I visited their website. They design and manufacture their own jewelry. Peora has excellent quality, craftsmanship and....excellent customer service. I respect this company. <end>  Excellent  Very nice piece. I bought it for my wife as a marriage anniversary gift. She loved it.The design and finish are nice. Sterling silver and garnet stone combination stands out. The photograph is not as good as the real jewellery; it does not justify the piece. <end>  Love it  I always end up getting a few compliments when I wear this one. It can go casual or formal, good size, great price. <end>
 B000P3LM68  0.75 carats total weight Princess Cut Garnet & White CZ Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  I like it and no problems with my chain  I purchased this well over two years ago and it still looks great. The chain is a somewhat thicker herringbone, probably about an 1/8 of an inch. It's an attached chain, but I have no problems with it twisting on my neck. I did remove the extender and wear it at 16 inches...up near my clavicles. If you like fine gauge chains, this is probably not for you. When I wear it, I get a lot of nice comments on it's beauty and style. <end>  Cute Necklace  I purchased this necklace for my wedding. The chain seems a little cheap and kept getting twisted. It is not as solid as I thought it would be. The garnet is very pretty. For the price, I thought it would be a little nicer. <end>
 B000P3T8LO  Necklace - N71 - Murano Glass Style - Round Shape ~ Red with Flecks ||	  not happy  The necklace came broken with the clasp unattached from the ribbon. Couldn't you have used something more robust for making the necklace? <end>
 B000P3XNRE  Men's Titanium 7mm Black and Gray Plain Wedding Band ||	  Don't bother.  Don't bother. Gets dirty really easily and gets all sorts of gunk in the two grooves. <end>
 B000P3ZTC6  Men's 14k Yellow Gold 6mm Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 12 ||	  Wonderful fit.. very comfortable  I needed to replace my band. Much to my dismay, it really wasn't worth resizing. Let me fill you in a little. My wife and I decided to get married and decided to avoid the stress. Along with other quickie steps, we got our bands at the local Wal-Mart. Now, my band no longer fits we decided to get the band I should have. My first stop was Amazon and I found this one. This is a nice solid ring, soft edges and fits comfortable. My orignial band dug into my finger and felt thin and cheap (because it was). This ring was worth every dollar. Knowing now, I would have spent the original retail price. as far as looks, the pic does no justice. It's a rich buttery gold look and the etching gives the look of a gold dust finish. And most importiently, it does not look like the mass produced rings at the mall jewelers. <end>

 B000P4Q668  14k Yellow Gold Journey Diamond Horseshoe Pendant ||	  Nice pendant, very delicate chain, poor quality c clasp.  I purchased the yellow gold version of this item as a Christmas gift for my wife. I was very pleased with the look of the horseshoe pendant but the chain looked very delicate to me. This morning, less than 2 weeks since Christmas, my wife went to put it on & the c ring clasp broke. We took it to a jeweler to have a new clasp put on. I was not very happy but at least it broke when she was putting it on & not while she was wearing it. I also paid considerably more than the current advertised price. I would have expected a much better quality chain & clasp. <end>  Beware  Pendant did look nice and as the other reviewer said, clasp has a lot to be desired.. Four months later a stone fell out and was lost. Oh well best to deal with people who stand behind what the sell. I was offered a five dollar credit by Amazon to get it replaced at a local jeweler. <end>  14k Yellow Gold Journey Diamond Horseshoe Pendant  Wonderful gift/item to Honor the horse you Love or just your Love of the horse! <end>
 B000P4TV7O  14k Two-Tone Diamond Heart Ring (1/10 cttw, H-I Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  So Cute!  Petite and adorable, It is the perfect size for everyday wear.

She keeps looking at it and she loves it. What more could I ask? <end>  A tiny ring  I really don't think the ring is worth the amount I paid for it. It's small & light weight. The diamonds are hardly visible. I'm seriously thinking about returning it to Amazon., because I believe I can get a better bargain somewhere else. <end>  fantastic design  hi, i like the designs of diamond rings very much. i would buy that if it was possible to buy from bd <end>  My favor ring design  I lke it so much! I am enjoy have it and recomend to other women.Good quality,resonable price.I will buy more jewelerry simular to this ring. <end>  Outstanding gift on a budget  The ring looked exactly like the picture! In dim light the, diamonds look a little faded; but once the natural light floods over the ring it just "pops". The shipping was outstanding, the ring came a day earlier than expected. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great piece of jewelry on a budget. <end>  Great ring!  This is a beautiful ring. I cannot believe I got it at such a great price too! <end>  A Phenomenal Ring!  This ring is perfect!

All I got to say is that this ring will make your lover very happy! <end>  Makes an excellent promise ring!  This ring is awesome! It is a little small, but it doesn't need to be big(especially for this price) and it is beautiful nonetheless. I bought it for my girlfriend and gave it to her as a promise ring on Valentine's Day, and she loves it and never takes it off! <end>  A very beautiful ring  This is a very beautiful ring. The design and the combination of two gold tones make it an exquisite product.Due to its simplicity, it doesn't not scream for attraction, but is nevertheless a great anniversary gift. <end>  Absolutely awesome!!!!!!!  My boyfriend bought this for me as a promise ring and it is absolutely beautiful. Its not to small and not to big. The two tone is very pretty. Its fits pretty true to size. I would recommend this ring for the money. It is definitely worth it. <end>  I love this ring  I love this ring. yes the picture makes everything larger but... consider the price. Really? You think you're gonna get huge diamonds? This ring is sweet and cute and it IS skinny. Actually, it's petite and very feminine. I love it and wear it all the time. I love the two toned gold, it's very interesting. It's a very sweet little ring. I'm so happy. <end>  Beautiful  This ring is lovely! The white and yellow gold make it perfect make for all jewelry pieces plus the diamonds sparkle with clarity. My son gave this to his girlfriend as a promise ring and she loved it! It is simple and elegant. <end>  Great  Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and it's her favorite ring that she wears constantly. I think it's really pretty and she obviously agrees. I was really happy with it for sure. <end>  nice ring  Wasnt sure how the ring would be but i was suprised. This is a great little ring for the price. I even had to exchange the size and amazon did it for free. Seriously...you cant go wrong. Money well spent. <end>  14 K two-tone diamond heart ring  I review this item, i check out the pro's and the con's. I should of listening to the con's more. I'm very dissatisfied with this ring. The only reason I'm keeping it because I hate to order items and return them. The ring is very small. I order two heart shaped rings, and I love the cheaper one better than i liked the 14K two-tone diamond heart ring. I hope no one else order this ring looking for a good deal, because it's not. I gave it a two-star because for the money I paid for the ring, and it fits perfect, I will keep it. For two hundred bucks I was expecting a little more. Sorry about the bad review, but I tell it like it is. <end>  Really nice gift to my girlfriend  She love it and we engaged and this is a beautiful ring. However, size 7 is a little big for her finger and the nice Amazon return policy help me to return that one and then I ordered size 6. It's just perfect! <end>  great  Great, it was my first time ordering online i had a bit of trouble processing the payment but with the excelent help of their costumer service it was shiped that night and got deleverd in two days the ring is amazing could not have asked for anything better, looks just like the picture  ) <end>  Diamond Ring  I am very pleased with this ring. I received it in great time. Thank you for fulfilling my order, The ring is very pretty. <end>  14k two-tone Diamond ring  I asked my husband for this ring to celebrate our 27th wedding anniversary. He listened!! I LOVE the ring, it is beautiful !!Thank you my love! <end>  Two tone ring  I very much liked the design of the ring and the fact that it was two toned gold (white gold and yellow gold) not gold and silver. However I was a little disappointed in the size of the ring as far as overall size not finger sizing. However it is a lovely ring and I'm sure I will enjoy it. <end>  worth the price  I was pleased with this ring. It was as advertised. It was what I had hoped it would be. twenty <end>  l2 tone heart ring  my husband bought me this ring for valentines day and i love it it is pretty and the two tone looks awesome it is a great gift for someone you love <end>  Not Completly Satisfied  Not near as large as I thought it was going to be. My wife is wearing it as a pinky ring becouse of the small size. <end>  disappointed customer  I was a little disappointed in the sales person. When all I wanted to do is exchange this ring for a smaller size and I couldn't. I had to return it and then buy a smaller size for money which I felt it was unfair. <end>  Great, inexpensive ring  This ring looks great at the picture, but unfortunately in real life it's a little different. At the picture it looks like there's more yellow gold and just a quarter or third of ring is white gold. The ring I've got has quarter of yellow gold and the rest is white gold. Other than that it is excellent ring for such price and it still looks great. Quite fast shipping and good packaging. <end>  Beautiful Ring  The ring came in as pictured, lovely quality. I am completely satisfied with this ring, and I have had no problems. Even shipping happened faster than I expected. Overall this has been the one of the best buys I've made, an excellent deal on such a lovely piece of jewelry. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I asked my boyfriend to purchase this item for me last Christmas. He did, and I still never ever take it off. It is beautiful and I love it. Mine is exactly like the picture, was exactly what I wanted, and I have zero complaints. Love it. <end>  Great Ring  I bought this ring for my girlfriend on our 3 year anniversary and it was a hit! She loves it and hasn't taken it off. The two-tone is beautiful and symbolic. I noticed a few reviews mentioned that the ring was small, but it really isn't too bad at all. It's perfect (size & all) for the occasion (anniversary/promise ring)! All together, this was a Good buy... I recommend it. <end>  Great  I have brought lots of product from Amazon and it is a great experience shopping with Amazon. This ring looks great. My ring looks exactly like in the picture. Fast shipping and this is a superb gift for myself.14k Two-Tone Diamond Heart Ring (1/10 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 8 <end>  Bought for my Gf''s birthday  she Loves it and wears it everyday  D it was my first time buying a ring and i have to say i made a good choice. <end>  Two tone heart ring  Fast shipping (amazon prime). My wife love this ring. It was a great deal. I had a hard time finding something my wife would like for under $400.00. <end>  Perfect ring.  I was a little worried about the size but the ring is perfect, i can't wait to gift this to my girlfriend. <end>  Great ring  The recipient of this ring has had this for over a year now and it is still in great condition. It is a beautiful ring, however, be aware that it may be a little smaller in person that it appears online. The diamonds are pretty small. But it was just right for our occasion. She wears it on her middle finger because I must have ordered a size too large to fit the ring finger it was intended for. Read a lot of reviews to decide on this one and glad I did. <end>  Very nice one flaw  My girlfriend loved it, however the picture that is given makes the ring seem way larger. In reality it is a very slim and skinny ring as in the width of the band. Love how the color just merges into each other though. Very smooth, shiny, etc. Its cheap compared to its quality and looks. <end>  ring  I was disappointed in the ring because the picture of it looks as if the diamonds and hearts were bigger! The pictures on the website should be more realistic! <end>
 B000P4U2XG  14k White Gold Diamond Pixie Pendant (0.03 cttw) ||	  Beautiful Pixie  The pendant is really pretty and delicate. Another reviewer said it's really small - not really, you wouldn't want it any bigger. i love it! <end>  very cute and pretty  bought it for my friend and she absolutely loved it. Came in a nice box and i did not think at all that it looked small. BUY!! <end>  Wow  I picked up this for much cheaper at a department store. Exact same pendant.Very cute, I love it and purchased it as a gift for a friend that loves fairies. <end>  so small  is a very beutifull fairy, but is soooo small you don't even see it...so sad, cause i really love it in the picture and when it arrive i was very sad to see it soo small, i used anyway, but i think is to much money for something that small! <end>
 B000P4XWQK  14k Gold Precious Gemstone and Diamond J Hoop Earrings ||	  Disappointed about the size  These earrings are nice but I am really disappointed about its actual size. It's tiny! But regardless, it's a beautiful gift! <end>  More lovely than their picture  Beautiful. Good workmanship. ice stones. Diameter a bit smaller than I thought but otherwise will be a nice Christmas present for my bride.I. <end>  Beautiful accents to a sapphire necklace!  I bought these to match a sapphire necklace I also bought for my wife, and I think they look wonderful with both her sapphire and diamond pendants. My wife is fairly petite, so the earrings looked just the right size on her. The sapphires look very pretty (although almost black). The diamonds are nice, and are about what you would expect for the small weight described in the product information. Personally, I love that the diamonds flash a bit in the dark, and that the sapphires show up well in the light - they compliment each other well. <end>  Purrfect Earrings  These earrings are beautiful!! Not too big or not to small. Only bad thing about them is needs to be made with screw backs for security purposes, so they don't come out until you want them off.. Great Price <end>  Very beautiful!  These sapphire and diamond earrings are so beautiful!!! Yes, they are small but not too small and look great! Also they are high quality made. Love them. <end>  Beautiful earrings  These are much prettier in person and are well worth buying for an emerald lover. I was impressed and will order a second pair for a gift, or maybe to keep. I searched a lot of stores but these were the best bargain! Fairly large, the green is pretty good and the diamonds really make them look expensive. <end>  Really Pretty.  The photo does not do these justice. The rubies are red not, pinkish like the pic. and the diamonds are really sparkley for chips. They were a wee bit smaller than I thought they'd be but, over-all very nice. I bought them for my wedding on Oct. 3rd., but wore them everyday up to then! <end>  Fancy jewelry  These earrings are really quite beautiful, but so small that I returned them. They were a good deal for the price (I got them for about $100) but I didn't think they would get much wear - too small for important occasions, too elegant for everyday. <end>  small and off color  They are smaller than I expected and the color is lighter in person. I bought them for my mother to match one of her rings and the colors do not match, according to the picture they should have. However, my mother still liked them so we kept them. <end>  Great buy for the money!  These emerald diamond hoop ear rings are great! Not to big and high quality made!.....for the money compared to private jewlery stores you can't find these for this price! <end>  Small and easy to lose  I was so excited to receive these earrings. They were smaller than I thought they'd be but I thought, lovely.I wore them twice, then lost one. I'm heartbroken, but vow to never buy anything that doesn't have a more secure backing.Maybe you'd love it but I'm disappointed...mostly at myself. <end>  Gave these Sapphires as a birthday gift for a family member ... she adores them!  I bought these 14k Yellow Gold Sapphire and Diamond J-Hoop Earrings as a birthday gift for a family member.She adores the creative earring design - slightly offset J-shaped curves of eight dark blue sapphires and eleven bright round diamonds on each J-Hoop earring.The earrings are about 1/2" wide and 2/3" long.Although small enough for everyday wear, these earrings are exquisitely made and won't go unnoticed. She's happy with all the attention that these sapphire and diamond earrings receive!SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESThe diamonds in these earrings are clear and bright. According to the 'Jewelry Information' the color is IJ, clarity is 11-12. So, whatever imperfections that exist in these diamonds are not discernible without x10 magnification. I don't think that would ever be a problem!  ))DIAMOND SPECS  Minimum total gem weight is 0.09 carats. The diamonds are cut to a 'Good' grade - a typical cut for tiny diamonds. Diamonds with a 'Good' cut grade reflect most of the light entering them. These diamonds are tiny but they sparkle well enough for the price.The sapphires are natural. They are very dark blue with a minimum total gem weight of 0.48 carats.Set in 14k yellow gold, these elegantly styled dark blue sapphire and diamond earrings are perfect for adding a touch of glitz and glam to your wardrobe - whether it's for work or a night on the town.The earrings are attractively packaged in a regal blue suede box ... so I didn't have to gift wrap!  ))Hope this review was helpful ... Jeffrey A. (Jeff) <end>  Good for teen - this is a very small earing  The earings are beautiful, but very small. This would be a wonderful gift for a child or teen. If I had not received discounts bringing the price under $90 I would have sent them back.But they are beautiful. I am going to give them to my 12 year old neice for her birthday. <end>  Great item, somewhat disappointed in the size.  I ordered these earrings for my daughters birthday as sapphire is her birthstone. The ordering was easy and the delivery was really fast. The earrings are beautiful, the only thing is, I was a little disappointed in the size, I thought they would be a little larger. However, my daughter loves them and that's all that matters. Also, the price was fantastic. I will definately shop Amazon again!! <end>  14K Yellow Gold Emerald hoop earrings.  These earrings are smaller than I thought, but they almost match perfectly with a pendant I purchased. They look great and I wear them quite often. I would definitely recommend these earrings, before they're gone. <end>  OK  Just OK, they were much smaller than I expected. Do not purchase for a woman who's hair may fall near the ears as these earrings will not be seen <end>  dainty hoops  The picture of these earrings is somewhat misleading. I had expected a larger hoop. Quality is good compared to cost. If you like to wear large hoops, these probably are not for you. <end>  Beautiful earrings at a great price!  I got these earrings for my mother for Christmas and she LOVES them! These are very nice quality - they feel sturdy, look beautiful and feel more luxurious than one might expect for the price.As others have said, they are a little on the small side. That said, I think that's a positive. They are very elegant and wearable and the fact that they aren't giant makes them suitable for everyday wear and special occasions. Even better, the design is unique. No more standard studs or a rock with a circle of stones around it. These feel like something that only she will have. <end>  Nice Christmas Present  Got these in emerald to complement a separately purchased pendant. Wife likes them very much. Some have commented on the earrings being smaller than expected ('for the price") but Ive found most Jewelry (especially jewelry using 14 kt gold) being more expensive compared to even a year or two ago (as gold prices continue to rise I see more Silver and 10 kt gold being offered in gemstone jewelry than in the past). I found these to be a much better deal after comparing elsewhere for similar quality jewelry. These are just right for my wife and the second "leg" with the diamonds makes for a different style than her other "J-type" earrings and add a nice touch. Not sure why the ruby version costs more than the other options (emerald, sapphire) <end>  Gorgeous!  These are beautiful--I got the emerald ones, and they have not left my ears since I received them. I actually don't think they're too big or too small, so I've loved wearing them everyday ) I highly recommend them! <end>  J- Hoop Earrings  For the price I was expecting bigger hoops earrings.I like the earrings but disapointed in size the stones are small as well. <end>
 B000P4XWTW  14k Yellow Gold Smoky Quartz Briolette Dangle Earrings ||	  not what I was expecting  These earrings are so small they're completely unnoticable unless the light hits them. The swing wildly even if you're barely moving. More of a nuisance than I was hoping for... I was looking more for an elegant earring to wear in a professional setting. <end>  Big different than photo  Big different than photoIt's look very nice in photoBut in real very small!!!You need microscope to see it <end>  Very pretty earrings  These smoky quartz earrings are simply beautiful. Approx. 1-3/16" long, they are dainty but have presence. The briolettes are about 1/4" long and about 2/16" in thickness--they are not slivers of smoky quartz like the picture might suggest. It should be noted that the 14K balls topping the earrings are cut in half and hollow, but do not detract from the beauty of these earrings. They have a nice sparkle! <end>  small but pretty  The quality of the stones and of the actual jewelry itself is very good given the price of $30. That said they were a bit smaller than I anticipated. I have long hair and they are very easily hidden but when I wear my hair up they look gorgeous. They are delicate and have just enough swing to be noticed but don't make me look like I should be at a dance club. If you usually wear studs and want to try dangle earrings these are a great step. I would give them 4.5 stars but Amazon won't let me. <end>  Beautiful and feminine  These earrings are beautiful. They are dainty and feminine; much more so than in the photo. The chain is delicate; but the earring is well construction. Very pretty! <end>  Waaaaaay too small  These earrings are cute but much much smaller than the picture leads you to believe. If I had seen them prior to purchase, I would not have bought them. <end>  The surprise!  The surprise!It is very small compared to the image ... I wish the Amazon attach jewelry sizes with the information and thank you .. <end>  I Feel Misled  Yes, the earrings are of good quality but they are extremely small. The picture and description are very misleading. Perhaps you must read between the lines when they say elegant. In reality they are an only an inch long and the stones are very small as well. They kind of look like children's earrings not something for a woman. If I had seen them previously, I never would have ordered them. <end>  great buy  for the $16 I spent, the earrings were worth the money. very cute and not too small <end>  I love these!  These earrings are so light and tiny, you'll forget you have them on! Yes, it is true that they are quite small, as others have reviewed before. But I love them, since they do not overpower your face, especially if you have short hair, like mine. Also, they go with almost anything! A great product at a great price! <end>  I am so sorry to tell you this, but I don't think it is the 14K  I have skin problem with the imitation or low karat gold, that is why I ordered 14K.But wearing this earing cause the skin irritation.Never order this one whoever has picky skin like mine.14k Yellow Gold Smoky Quartz Briolette Dangle Earrings <end>  Very cute  It is a very cute earrings, it is small good for teens and adult who like to wear small jewelry. I love them. <end>
 B000P4ZKQ0  14k Yellow Gold Amethyst Rope Trimmed Earrings ||	  Pretty Earrings  These earrings are small, but the color of the amethyst stone and the gold is vibrant. Lovely earrings for any woman like myself who prefers stud type earrings or for a young girl who wants something classical. The setting of the post is different from most stud earrings so the earring actually has a top and bottom. The butterfly back is small but this is a plus if you dislike obvious backs to your earrings. So glad I purchased these and the matching pendant. <end>  Amethyst earrings  I got these for my mom for her birthday and she loved them. Good size and very dainty. <end>  Very nice!  I also got the matching pendant. These earrings are a nice size. While they are not bold, they are not tiny at all. They are very noticeable and very feminine. <end>  amethyst earrings  These earrings are very pretty. I was a little disappointed in the size - they are very tiny. I guess the price reflects the size. <end>  Beautiful for a birthday gift  I was searching for a birthday gift for my 19 year old granddaughter and when I saw the earrings and necklace I knew that was the exact perfect gift and she loved it. <end>
 B000P4ZKQU  14k Gold Pear-Shaped Gemstone Pendant Necklace with Rope Trim, 18" ||	  Great Value  This is a really nice necklass for the price. The stone is quite large and has nice color. The gold chain is pretty, but it is quite thin. <end>  Beautiful and worth the money  I ordered this as a gift and when I received it I was pleasantly surprised. It was beautiful and rich looking and it looked lovely on as well. I would definitely order this again or something similiar <end>  it's okay but not for the price  I love brown so with all these great reviews I thought I'd really like this. The chain is extremely thin/delicate and the gem is small. It's so light that it flips over easily which doesn't look so great. I got it with the matching dangle earrings which look like large ants; I'm returning those. I may return the necklace as well; it's okay but I want more for my $70. <end>  Gorgeous but poor presentation  As I have mentioned in other jewelry reviews, Amazon jewelry is hard to beat from a price point of view and this is no exception - unfortunately a velvet bag is in place of a nice little box and the chains are always in a twisted mess. <end>  Stunning  Best quality and value. A stunning piece that compliments many outfits. Works for dress up or every day. Fast ship, too. <end>  My wife loves it!  Seems small to me but my wife loves it! Only other goof was aquamarine is the birthstone for March, NOT amethyst but she says its fine! It is very pretty in the sunlight. And its a lighter purple than in the photo. <end>  Grandson's birthstone  I bought my wife this stunning Blue Topaz Pendant for our 44th wedding anniversary and to celebrate our first grandchild born Dec. 12. She loves it and the connection to baby Nicholas makes it a treasured gift. The color is brilliant, and the chain is delicate and does not detract from the pendant. A great buy and a great value. Thank you Amazon, you make shopping online a rewarding experience. <end>  Lovely stone and setting, tiny chain  This was a Christmas gift for my wife, the stone and setting are very nice quality but the chain was petite and short for my wife's preferences. Unfortunately she tried it on and the pendant flips over repeatedly. Am not sure if it is due to being placed on a larger chain I purchase seperately but we'll be returning it since can't seem to keep it "right" side up. <end>  14 yellow gold pear-shaped blue pendant  A beautiful stone . I gave this necklace as a Christmas present. This piece catches the light and speaks volumes. <end>  for my wife  I bought this pendant to match the ring and earring set my wife has. She loves the match and wears it everywhere. <end>  Love it  Simply beautiful and amazing. I was so happy and surprised that it was so fabulous Thank you very much for a great product <end>  Lovely stone  I tried to buy this stone in the UK but couldn't find one with a gold chain anywhere. was a little concerned about the size of the stone but it's better than I expected. The gold chain is a little thin but it all looks great. <end>  Nice basic  Pendant is a nice medium brown and rope detail stands out. This stone goes well with almost everything in my wardrobe, and picks up tints from whatever color is on my neckline. I'm using my own chain. <end>  Very nice  Very nice overall, the pendant was the main attraction, nice size, simple but still elegant. The chain is very delicate and will have to be replaced as I expected. Very pleased she's happy I'm happy! Funny how that works. <end>  GrannyX5  I am not sure what some people expect. I am very pleased with my purchase. The size of the stone is a very nice size and the color is just beautiful. Thank you Amazon for this beautiful piece! <end>  Very Nice Pendant  I received this Pendant today. It is very nice. Just the right size. The chain is a little thin. I will put it on another chain. I will purchase other items from Amazon. <end>  Nice and small  I was expecting a bit bigger pendant but the quality looks OK. The amethyst is nicely cut. The box it came in was a very cheap/lowest end paper box. So -1 for packiging that should go with $5.00-10.00 pendant, not a $150.00-200.00 pendant. <end>  SMOKY QUARTZ PENDANT  Thank you Amazon for your prompt service and quality merchandise. I am thoroughly pleased with the color and size of the stone and the beautiful design. I purchased the earrings also and my daughter will LOVE them. <end>  pendent  The Pendent I purchesed was just as described but not as good as it looked on the internet <end>  Smoky Quartz Pendant  The cut, color and clarity of this pendant is outstanding. The rope accent is a perfect compliment to the stone. Matching earrings really set off a beautiful look! <end>  Very nice  Arrived quickly looks very nice. Only problem is that it is shipped in a little pouch and it took about 15 minutes to untangle the chain. <end>
 B000P4ZKV0  14k Yellow Gold Chrome Diopside Floral Earrings ||	  nice  Nice; the ones i got were a little lighter than the picture. But very clear and lots of fire.The only reason I rate them down slightly is that the diamond might not was well be there its so small.Decent price decent stones. <end>  satisfied  As other comments have noted, the middle stone is small.Even though the middle stone is small the color is great, and I amover all pleased with them. <end>  High quality  This earring set was received promptly and in excellent condition. The quality of the stones is high. <end>  Loved it  I received this pair, it's a little bit smaller than I expected. However, it sparkles and looks beautiful on my ear lobes. I wear it frequently and received good comments from my co-workers. <end>  Beautiful!  I bought these for my niece to wear when competing in Irish Step Dancing Competitions - they match her costume beautifully and she loved them ... and so did her mother! <end>  Earrings  I ordered these for my wife at Christmas they arrived in plety of time, presented well and were of a good quality. Just what I wanted <end>
 B000P51O1O  14k Yellow Gold Chrome Diopside Floral Pendant, 18" ||	  Beautiful  I got this necklace as a gift and I love it!!! The color is stunning and the size is perfect; not to small, not to big. Have gotten tons of complements on it. <end>  Not that good  The pendant is fair but the chain is thin and breaks easy the "Diamond" is toooooo small the picture shown is oversized i think they must show this picture with another one with the real size of the item. <end>
 B000P52616  18k Yellow Gold Overlay Sterling Silver Topaz and Diamond Accent Oval Earrings ||	  It looks 'WOW' here, but u get just the opposite expression when u receive the delivery.  I purchased this item as soon as i looked it here... and i was expecting a amazing ear-ring. But when i received the package, it was not so amazing.If you look here, it seems that the 'Topaz' is surrounded by white crystals, but actually if you look carefully those are not the crystals but just pieces of shining silver.Moreover, the ear-rings are made in China, so you can expect the quality. <end>  Awesome product for the price!!  You can't go wrong with these, they are stunning and look as if they cost much, much more!!!They are one of my favorites. <end>
 B000P548BC  18k Yellow Gold Plated Sterling Silver Emerald Heart Pendant ||	  well made  I had bought the jewelry for a friends mother and she loved it. It looks better when you see it in person not in a picture. The picture does not do justice. It's a great gift for a mom , a teenager or a girlfriend.Well made and strong chain and crafted beautifully. <end>
 B000P548CQ  18k Yellow Gold Overlay Sterling Silver Sapphire and Diamond Accent Butterfly Earrings ||	  Cute and a great price  My wife is not hard to please, but I can really tell she likes something because her eyes just light up. She saw these little earrings when I gave them to her and I knew right away that I made a smart choice. The best $20 I ever spent. <end>  Nice  These earrings are lovely. I bought them for my mother and I know she will love them also. Excellent price for the product. <end>  Good for picky individuals  They are smaller than the picture makes them appear, but otherwise are identical.I gave these to my sister, who is a picky person when it comes to basically everything. She loved them. They are quite unique and look ery nice. A different look for people who like studs. <end>  a nice gift  I bought this because I thought it would have diamonds, but I was wrong. It was a design to look like a diamond. These are really cute earrings. <end>  pretty little thing  I bought this for my mother in law as a Christmas present. It was casual enough to wear anywhere. small but elegant to wear. <end>
 B000P5667G  Sterling Silver Filigree Oval Flower Earrings ||	  Nice casual earrings  I love wearing these with jeans. They are a very nice earrings. I have gotten several compliments on them. I have the necklace as well. They finish off a nice casual outfit. <end>
 B000P59SRG  Sterling Silver Celtic Design Rectangular Dangle Pendant, 18" ||	  Just beautiful  I bought the entire set when Amazon was having their 20% off celtic jewelry sale (earrings, bracelet and pendant). What a great deal. Got a lot of compliments. Items are lovelier than they show in the picture and high quality for the price. Highly recommend! <end>  Elegant  I gifted this to a friend recently and she loved it saying it was simple and elegant to wear to work. <end>  Very classy necklace my stepmom loved it!  I bought this necklace for my stepmom's birthday and she loved it. I thought it looked very classy on her. <end>  Low quality  This item was rather embarrassing; it doe not have the shadows and 'embossed' look it appears to have in the photo. More of a flat surface, cut-out, design. <end>  Beautiful design!  This pendant/chain is a beautiful delicate design. The silver is very good quality and overall this was a great value. The shipping is always a plus at amazon- fast !pendant, silver, necklace, <end>  Nice accent  I like the weight of the pendant as well as the simplicity of the design. I've received several compliments on it. However, the link holding the chain to the clasp has already separated and had to be repaired, so the chain is somewhat less than ideal. <end>
 B000P66LF2  Sterling Silver Amethyst Three-Stone Ring, Size 7 ||	  Good for the price  I can't argue with the quality of this ring for the price. I feel like it is worth exactly what I paid for it. The stones seemed a lot smaller than in the picture, but that may be because I ordered the size 11, so compared to the width of the ring, the stones seemed kind of small. The stones are not as deep purple as in the picture, the ones I got are more lavender. Also, the stones are mounted a lot flatter than they look in the picture. It is still a pretty ring for the price, but it is definitely a cheaper ring. <end>  A beautiful ring for everyday wear!  I received this ring today and I was very pleased with the look, quality and price. The coloring is very close to the picture on Amazon, which is not always the case. It is currently only available in a size 10, so I do have to wear it on either my thumb or middle finger and even then it's a bit loose. I couldn't pass up the deal when it was offered and I'm not disappointed at all. Yet another good buy from the Amazon.com collection!If you want some other pieces to wear with it I would suggest these Sterling Silver Amethyst Hoop EarringsSterling Silver Amethyst Pendant, 18" <end>  Gorgeous ring  I loved my 3 stone blue topaz so much I had to have this one as well. It is gorgeous and the workmanship is unsurpassed! <end>  good ... classy  This is a pretty ring with accurate sizing. However, the part that faces the palm ie the underside of hte ring has scratches after 1 week (though that part doesnt show too much). Also while the pciture shows thw stones to be darker coloured than they are. Amethysts are lighter purple and thats what the ring has. <end>  Awesome ring to give or buy for yourself.  Gemstones are a great shade (just a tad lighter than the photo), but not by much. Ring and setting are simple, but nice. <end>  Beautiful ring/unbelievable price  The ring is very sparkly and beautiful. The band is sturdy and the stones are securely fastened. I couldn't believe the price of $20 for a sterling and gemstone ring. I would have been happy with my purchase if I had paid double. The ring looks much more expensive than it is. It looks better in person then it does in the picture. A wonderful thoughtful gift for any women on your list who loves jewels, and purple. <end>  So pretty!  I bought two of these as gifts for my mom and mother-in-law and they both loved them. They are very pretty while being quite sturdy and well-made. The only disappointment was that it is only available in a size 5 so we had to have them both sized. <end>  Couldn't be happier!  The ring is beautiful and I couldn't be happier! I will definately look on Amazon for my next ring because I can order in my size (9) and wear it from the day I get it instead of paying someone to resize it. <end>
 B000P68EKM  14k White Gold Pave Diamond Ring (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  When they say white they mean it...  Good- nice band, no scratches, feels heavy.Bad- Cloudy white diamonds, one had a big black speck, not even close to clear diamonds...When they say "white diamonds" that is precisely what they mean. The description of the diamonds (H-I color and I2 clarity) is accurate in the ad, the photo (I feel)showed clear diamonds and was not accurate. If you are looking to impress anyone who knows anything about diamonds go to a real jeweler and spend the bucks.I am using this as an everyday wedding band to "replace" my original wedding set. My engagement ring use to catch on everything and this one does not. Now I can put my hand in my pocket without it snagging on the flap for instance. As a lefty the bulky wedding set was a nuisance.This is a good item for everyday wear. I don't have to worry if I lose it or damage it because it was so inexpensive. Basically, I calculated the value of the gold (I figured the diamonds as worthless) and the price (on special sale) was less then that so I really couldn't go wrong here.Additionally, if the seller doesn't provide the weight of the gold (without the gems), karat (10,14,18), and the minimum clarity and color of the diamonds DON'T BUY it. You're asking to be ripped off. Amazon is usually good about providing that information. <end>  I was disappointed.  Nice looking but it was smaller in scale than I expected. It is lightweight. I was surprised that it was made in China. <end>
 B000P69FTQ  10k White Gold Diamond 3-Stone Earrings (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Insult of the century earrings  After finally locating these earrings in their little blue pouch, I felt like I had been played for a fool. Some things should not even be sold unless an absolutely full disclosure is made in describing them, without using typical marketing euphemisms such as "dainty". These earrings resembled tiny flecks of aluminum foil. I really felt hurt and insulted that anyone would claim that their value was so high and that the reduced price was a mere $119.99. And when you hear the word "diamond" and pay over $100.00 for a pair of earrings, don't you think you should at least have them arrive in a pretty velvet box? Regardless of the product desciption of the packaging, I know I deserve better for my money, and the tiny pouch only added insult to injury. Please don't buy these, unless you are prepared to be very disappointed. <end>  Very satisfied  These earrings were meant as a small stocking stuffer for my wife at Christmas. She was surprised and very pleased when she opened them and has been wearing them ever since. When she is happy, I am happy. Many thanks for making these available and getting them shipped out to me in a timely manner! <end>
 B000P6F6M6  Nurse Silver & Crystal Expressively Yours Bracelet ||	  very pretty  A nice bracelet that looks like it costs more than it did. I bought this as a gift for my son's girlfriend, who is a nursing student, and she seemed to really like it. Pretty gift box, too. <end>  Great  This made a great addition to the nurse collection. I wear it as often as I can. I recommend it <end>  Great Item for Cost  I purchased this as a gift for my daughter who is a Nurse.She had one like it before and really liked it. It is aGreat Gift for any Nurse in family. <end>  Good purchase  We purchased this for my sister who was graduation nursing school. She really liked it. It seemed like it was well-made and more expensive than what we paid for it. <end>  Exactly as expected  This product was delivered on time and in great condition. The product was exactly as it had been described online and i got exactly what i was expecting. Thank you so much! <end>  Nice!  Happy with this gift I bought for my SIL for Christmas. Great price for the quality of item. Would recommend this purchase to someone interested in a low price gift for someone. <end>  Bought this for a graduating Nursing student (my neice)  I know I only paid $8 for this and its plastic but it is so cute and I love the colors and the charm that says nurse on it. Also there is a little card that comes with it with the nurse prayer on it. Very nice set up with the box and everything for the price. I know she will love it! <end>  beautiful!  It was exactly what i was looking for and expected. It's just beautiful and i know my friend will love it! <end>  Pretty gift for nurse  I bought this as a small gift for my best friend who is a nurse. It is very pretty and comes in a cute little box. It is wrapped in plastic on the inside, so I would recommend having it delivered to you, taking the plastic off (and taking the stickers off the box) and then gifting it. Definitely worth the price. <end>  Just as I expected  The bracelet showed up in a nice light blue box with a bow (think Tiffany's) and was exactly as I had expected. My wife is a new nurse and this was a gift &#34;from&#34; our son. She loved what it stood for, but unfortunately, it is a bit on the big side. My wife does have pretty tiny wrists, so it may just be her, but it falls off her hand pretty easily.If the person you are getting this for has never had a problem with other bracelets/watches in the past, it should be fine. However, its not adjustable, so the size is what it is. This will be more of a keepsake for her, than an actual item she will wear. <end>  Beautiful  Bought as gift for my sister in law for graduating nursing school. She received many compliments and told me that she loved it <end>  Looks good!  I thought this bracelet would look cheap but it doesn't at all! I am planning on buying a teacher one for my son's teacher. <end>  bracelet  Bought this for my nursing student daughter but decided to put it away for Christmas. Its pretty and seems fine. Will try to follow up with more information after she wears it. <end>  Great gift!!!!  This is a perfect gift to give to a person right before they finish nursing school so they can wear it to their pinning ceremony!!!!! <end>  Great gift idea!  Orded this as a gift for a friend who just became a nurse and could not be more pleased. The bracelet is very nice in person and the detail is beyond great for the low price. Definitely recommend as a gift or personal buy. <end>  Great purchase at a great price!  This is a great find! I bought five of these bracelets to give as gifts to some very special nurses in my life and one for myself. I loved them! They are beautiful! I love the blue beads, since blue is my favorite color. Sure the bracelet is not made out of silver, but it is still absolutely beautiful. I realize that some people have bigger wrists, but mine fit perfectly. I didn't even bother to undue the clasp as it slipped right on. I would definitely recommend this bracelet as a little something for that special nurse or new nurse in your life.These are excellent nursing school graduation presents! I am going to buy more for my other coworkers since the price is excellent. The price has gone up a little since I ordered initially but it is still not bad; under $7. <end>  okay  this item is pretty, and the box it comes it is even better with its satin touch and all, but the thing that bugged me the most was, the clasp, it keeped on undoing and falling off most of the time! <end>  Nurse Bracelet  I bought this for a friend who recently graduated from nursing school. It is really pretty and is nice quality. It comes in a cute box. It is nicer than I expected for the low price! <end>  Not as described  The item was not as described, I was very unhappy with it. Although, I did return the item and get a full refund. It felt as though the item was made of cheap plastic beads, none if it was even silver, it was the faux painted on silver beads. <end>  Bracelet  Very beautiful bracelet. It was brought for a nursing gift and the receiver adores it. Stunning piece. Will get one for myself. <end>  Perfect!  I bought this beautiful bracelet for my best friend as a gift for graduating nursing school. When it came, my jaw fell at how pretty it was! The photo does not do the real thing justice! The price was quite fair, in my opinion. The beads are just lovely. The box it came in was very pretty, but I had a box already, so I saved it to use on a future gift. I did use the little card that came in it and it was a lovely touch. When my friend opened this bracelet and held it, she got overwhelmed and began to cry. She asked me to help her put it on and said it would match her scrubs!  ) I could not have thought of a more perfect gift for the newest nurse in my life! <end>  Cute and Appreciated  I bought this cute bracelet as a birthday gift for my daughter to give to her Godmother. Her Godmother loved it. She very proudly wears it to work. <end>  nurse bracelet  Purchased for a friend's daughter who is going to nursing school - she loves it! Very nice piece for the price. Comes in a cute blue box with silver ribbon. I would recommend this bracelet. <end>  Pretty Bracelet  I purchased this for a retirement gift and decided to keep it. I was impressed with how pretty and well made it was for the price. <end>  Very pretty  I got this as a Christmas gift for my best friend. It was a hit, really cute! A perfect gift for any nurse. <end>  Perfect gifts for Nursing Supervisors  We gave them to our six Nursing Supervisors at our hospital for Supervisor Day and they were perfect. They looked better than the picture showed and the shipping was quick. Would buy from again and recommend to everyone. <end>  Excellent!  This was a gift for my best friend who graduated as a RN in November. She absolutely adores this piece and wears it often. She's even received compliments on it! The bracelet comes in its own jewelry box that is ready to be gifted. You can't beat the quality for this price, it is definately not cheap looking which was a concern for me.. I'm so happy to have made this purchase. <end>  Great gift idea  Bought these for several friends who were graduating from nursing school..they loved them...turned out to be a great little gift idea <end>  i'm an RN so this is special piece to me  only complaint i have is i wish it wasn't going to fade. i like the bracelet & love the toggle piece. the best part is the nurse charm but i know i can't wear this all the time because it will fade... <end>  Purchased as a gift  I bought this for a nurse and she loved it. I thought it was a little youngish for an adult but not too bad. <end>  New Nurse  I bought this bracelet for a friend who was graduating from nursing school. When I received it however, the heart was broke into 2 pieces (front and back). I immediately contacted the seller and within a few days I had a new one shipped to me, no questions asked, in perfect condition. It's such a cute bracelet I now want one for myself! <end>  Beautiful & Excellent Value  This is a sweet little bracelet and beautiful! I do beading and the price is better than I could have done making it myself (even if I had the time). We gave this as a Christmas gift to our school nurse and she was overwhelmed by it's beauty and uniqueness. I can't comment on the size (some other reviewers felt it small) our nurse is an average woman, maybe trim - but the bracelet fit her perfect... she was so thrilled by it she asked me to help her put it on right away and she wore it throughout that day. This bracelet also came in a beautiful little gift box that got almost as many compliments as the bracelet itself. I highly recommend this and would buy it again for another nurse! (if I new one) <end>  A little small & cheap-looking  I like the idea of the bracelet and when on, it is somewhat cute. But, it is cheap looking and doesnt stretch or have any flexibility. It is a little over-priced for the quality if you ask me. It fits me but it wouldn't fix someone larger than me (and im 185!) <end>  Gotta love the nurses  I gave this bracelet to my niece for graduation from UK. I liked it so much I ordered myself one (yeah...I'm a nurse, too). I think every nurse should treat herself to such a nice bracelet. Be proud of who you are...NURSES!! <end>  nurse bracelet  I bought this bracelet as a gift for my daughter. When it arrived I was very pleased as it is even prettier in person. I still have it and am trying to wait to give it to her on her birthday. <end>
 B000P6K9E6  Bleach  Division Three Gin Ichimaru Symbol Anime Necklace ||	  "Great to Collect, Great to Wear"  This Item is a must have for any bleach collection. Also, according to the packaging as well as the seller, it is an officially licensed bleach product! However it is still important I go over the details. When it first arrived it came in a nicely packaged "blister card," which is pretty much just normal packaging like an action figure would come in. After opening, the necklace comes in a nice tin with a clear see through plastic window to display the product. The chain is obviously the one with the balls that allow it to easily lock in around your neck. The actual pendent is durable and it does stick to magnet (I had to check because I cannot always trust the internet). The picture is the Squad 3 (their captain is Captain Gin Ichimaru) insignia which represents a marigold and is supposed to mean "despair." In case anyone was wondering there is some type of product number or something on the other side of the pendent but just hide it in the back when you wear it. Overall this is a great product and I would recommend it to any bleach fan. <end>  The Marigold  This is a good quality piece; seems to have been well-made. I've had no problems with it so far and don't expect to. The charm is about an inch long, maybe longer when it starts to come to a point. It's heavy enough that you can feel it but not so much that it's a burden or a bother. It has lovely detail, and you can make you the individual petals on the marigold flower perfectly. It's double-sided, though one side does have the company name etched into it along with the design. The chain is a longer one, with the style of chain like those that typically come with dog tags. I know from experience that those kinds of chains are durable and, from the feel of the charm, I sincerely doubt anything is going to mess my necklace up anytime soon. Unless you use it for target practice (and you're a good shot), I'd say this it a very strong and lasting necklace and I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to show some Gin pride! <end>  Perfect!  Great quality, exactly as pictured! Chain is good too, it's the perfect length, fits over my head, but isn't too long  ) Amazing gift for any Gin or Bleach fan. The other side looks pretty much the same, but it does have a serial number on it. It came new in typical Shonen Jump necklace packaging  silver tin, with cardboard and plastic outer packaging. <end>  Very Satisfied  I wear this necklace every day and am delighted when someone recognizes it. I recommend it to Bleach fans not only as a collector piece, but as an awesome necklace. <end>
 B000P6L788  Adorlee Asian Jewelry Box ||	  Beautiful jewlery box  It is a beautiful jewlery box, but I used it on a bridal shower party toput the gift envelops, I got many complements.It is worth the price. I recommend it. <end>
 B000P6MU3E  Amazon.com  The Rose Lady 3-Pc. Pine Cone Jewelry Set, IRIDESCENT COPPER  Clothing ||	  Great Birthday Gift  I had given my wife some pine cone earrings several years ago and she loved them. She lost one and was very disappointed. I couldn't find what she had before but these caught my eye. They arrived faster than I expected and they were in plenty of time for her birthday, like a normal husband I had waited to the last minute. She loves these too and they look great! Thanks for helping to make a birthday special. The copper ones look almost real but shiny! Thanks. <end>
 B000P7729K  Rosary - Silver Toned Cross and Emerald Glass Bead Rosary for May Birthday Birthstones ||	  Fast Delivery  This product arrived on time. Unfurtunatly the rosary looks too much like a toy. This product is very fragile. When I bought it I was hoping to get a metal cross that was well defined but this is the complete oposite. Sorry but this product is not worth the money. The provider did a good job with mailing it to me and it arrived in good condition but it is just not worth it. Thanks <end>  Good service, poor product  The merchant was great with quick service, but the product was very flimsy. I wil be expecting to buy a replacement from another manufacturer when this one breaks. <end>
 B000P78ZYG  Celtic Rosary - Silver Toned Irish Celtic Cross with Green Glass Shamrock Beads and St. Patrick Insert Card ||	  Special  THis is very nice, just thought it would be made of better material. Kind of seems like cheap plastic. He liked it anyway. <end>  Celtic Rosary  This was advertised with other Boondock Saints items but my daughter who is extremely knowledgable of all Boondock Saints items said it was not consistent with the one in the movie.However the item is beautiful just not what she expected. <end>
 B000P7H9PM  14K Yellow Gold Butterfly Anklet 9.5" ||	  over rated  THe item was received tangled, and it took me 1 hour to untangle. Put it on my ankle on Saturday, and looked down on my leg on Thursday it was broke. Very thin item, to delicate to wear at any time. Good for show pience in the box. <end>  Nice anklet for a teenager  I bought this anklet as a birthday present for a friend. It came in very good condition and looks great. It is very delicate. I just hope that the young lady (15) will also like it. Her birthday theme will be butterflies.I think it looks beautiful and very feminine. <end>
 B000P8L7Y0  Bleach Shinigami Symbol Necklace ||	  half n half  I love the symbol, but the chain is terrible so i just switched it with another chain so its good now i recommend only if you have a back up chain waiting to replace the one it comes with. <end>  Shinigami Neck less  The neck less was everything I wanted and in very good quality. To chain is strong and the metal holds a shine. <end>  LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!  AMAZING, loved the way it fits on my neck. Perfect gift for a friend or for someone who watches bleach. Overall, it's the perfect necklace!! <end>  Great quality and great price!  I received this today right on time.The necklace is metallic black and feels very robust.The pendant itself is of the same color.The height is 1.25 inch and the width is also 1.25 inch (both measured from the widest spot)I am really happy! great product! <end>  Very Nice  I am really happy with this Necklace. it has good quality ad doesn't feel cheap considering it's price.I recommend it for all Bleach Anime Fans. <end>
 B000P9BXI4  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Charming Pretty Abalone Fish Hook Dangle Earrings ||	  Very Wearable  I love these earrings because they go with so many outfits, are very lightweight and extremely affordable. Great buy for all ages. <end>  Very pretty!  I purchased these earrings as a Christmas gift for my mother, and she thought they were beautiful! She is taking them on the cruise they are taking this week. What higher praise could there be? <end>  abalone earrings  I absolutely love these earrings. They are quite elegant. I would definitely recommend this product. <end>  I was disappointed.  Granted, the earrings were not expensive. However, I ordered them to go with an abalone pendent I purchased from another site. When they arrived in the mail, they were both broken. I never even took them out of the package. The little abalone stones had popped off of the silver mounts on both earrings. I will be able to buy some jewelers glue and glue them back on, but I shouldn't have to do that. Also, one of the sterling tear drop bases has a burr on it. It looks as though it should have been filed down, but was left on. As it turns out, I found a pair at Kohl's. <end>  Great Product for the Price  I have an abalone necklace for which I needed a pair of matching earrings. These definitely fit the bill! They appear to be of good quality. <end>  Very nice earrings!  Silver and Abalone. How can you argue with that? The abalone draws you in with its depth and variance and the silver sets it off with style and class. These look really good against my wife's skin and they make me want to get closer to her. Warm and soft, with a silversmith's attention to detail. As far as I am concerned, these are what earrings were intended to do.The price is outstanding. The delivery was right now, even over the holidays, with gift wrapping!This was another fine purchase I made with Gem Avenue and I will do so again! <end>  good  They're very beautiful and were just what I expected. No problems with payment or shipping. The only problem I had was that the stone on one of the earrings fell off within five minutes of opening the box. It'll be easily glued back on, but it was embarrassing for me since I'd just given them to my mother as a gift. <end>  Great Deal  I thought these were pretty when I saw them online, but I REALLY loved them when they arrived! Purchased as a gift, I'm going to get a pair for myself! The service was excellent too. <end>

 B000P9EZJS  Sterling Silver Polished Celtic Design Cross Pendant with 18 inch Cable Chain ||	  lovely celtic-inspired jewelry  This is a lovely celtic-inspired design, a little less intricate than most celtic cross pendants, but perfect for the girl with more conservative tastes. <end>
 B000P9EZKM  Sterling Silver Claddagh Ring Shepherds Hook Earrings ||	  Great but really small  These earrings are really great and came out as I expected. Silver quality is good and pattern is clear. Yet you need to have eagle eyes to notice, since they're really small. I checked the product info to see that I have missed the measurements but there isn't any. So it might be useful to notice the hooks are almost larger than the circles. <end>
 B000P9GZ14  Sterling Silver Onyx Claddagh Ring Pendant ||	  Pretty, but not very durable.  I bought this for my boyfriend in December, and it only took a month for the onyx in the middle to fall out. The necklace still looks good without the onyx, but I was a little disappointed at how quickly it fell apart. <end>
 B000P9WRXY  Cartouche Pendant - Made in Egypt - with "MOTHER" in Hieroglyphics - Solid Style ||	  it says mother not mom  i know a little about Egyption hieroglyphics and i know that the pendent says mother not mom. i know that some people r like so what it means the same thing but i feel that when u spend that much money on something u should at less have the right translation.so for anyone who is still reading this i will tell u about the symbols i know  the fist is a bird(i believe an owl) which stands for M / the second is a rope which is an O / the third symbol(which looks like a U on its side) stands for TH / then the feather looking symbols stands for E (it is also the symbol for I and Y) / the symbol that looks kinda like a mouth is R / and the last symbol is a woman siting which stands for woman. so yea if you wanted to know what the symbols stood for now u know and if u buy it for someone u can tell them what the symbols stand for and look super smart ;) <end>  mom loves it!!!  I was pleased with the purchase. there is a notch in the back from where the split the pendant from the mold, but it is not anywhere it can be seen when being worn, so it's no biggie to me. it is an excellent find for the price, and was shipped quickly. i'm definitely looking forward to purchasing more jewelry from this vendor in the future. <end>

 B000PAMB8Y  Sterling Silver Mother-of-Pearl Ring by Sajen, Size 7 ||	  Good deal  I bought this ring for my grandma's birthday. Its a good sized ring, but looked real nice on her ring finger. If your purchasing this for someone with smaller hands I would suggest their index or middle finger as the ring itself is quite large. <end>

 B000PAMCKG  Sterling Silver Scroll Design Quartz Ring by Sajen, Size 8 ||	  not as pictured  disappointing. overly shiny and is adjustable--that may be in the description, but i didn't see it.

 B000PAMG5W  Sterling Silver Loving Family Heart Necklace - Parents and 2 Children ||	  Perfect gift for a mother  This will fit the bill for our daughter in law. She will be reminded of her sweet family every time she looks at it. Just love it. <end>  Simple yet elegant  My girls and I were looking for a pretty necklace for me to wear on Mother's Day that represented our family. We wanted something simple but elegant...nothing flashy. This one fit the bill. It is very simple, but also pretty. We all loved it very much. Our only complaint is that the picture makes the pendant look a little more 3D, when in actuality, the pendant is flatter in real life. It would have been nice to have seen more pictures of the pendant from different angles to represent it better. However, we kept the necklace and I have worn it since Mother's Day. <end>  Bought as a gift  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Sister-in-law. It came in a very nice box. It looked to be a good quality. I've seen her wear it a couple times. Sometimes jewelry looks much better in the pictures, but in this case it's much prettier in real life. It's rather shiny, and the pictures have to hide that in order to show the detail. One thing I didn't notice in the picture, but did on the real one, is the kids hands/bodies/feet, make a second heart in addition to the one the whole family's arms make. <end>  Great bargain  I purchased this family necklace for a special friend who has 2 children. The special family bond that she has with her husband and two children is signified in this necklace. She loved it. The quality of this necklace is remarkable....looks like it should have cost way more. <end>  Beautiful, but...  I love the necklace, and since I have my second child on the way, it fits our family perfectly. It's a little different than you see in the pic - not as "3d" which is a plus, but it does make the necklace look a little different. <end>  Loved the family pendant  I loved the family pendant. It was beautiful and the chain is really nice. <end>  Nice design but...  The design and the symbolism of this pendant is very nice. But it was flatter than I expected - thought it would be more three-dimensional than it actually is. The matte finish on the body of the parents is also not that obvious from the pics. But for this price, I think it's a nice pendant in terms of design, packaging (gift-ready)and sentiment. <end>  pretty  After having our second child, I thought this might be a nice gift for my wife. It looks pretty on her, but is much smaller than I anticipated. <end>  Nice piece of jewelry  The pendant quality is very good with a nice finishing. The first two pictures give the wrong idea that the pendant is more tridimensional than it actually is. In reality is more flat.The chain is also very good but on the thin side. <end>  Beautiful Gift For My Daughter  I purchased this necklace as a gift for my grown daughter for her birthday...when it arrived I was so pleased with the quality and size of the pendant! It was meant to be a very special present for her, to represent the wonderful daughter that she is, the wonderful mother that she has become, and the loving family that I see she has created... This gift, I know, conveyed all of that to her sentimental heart. Thank you for such a nice piece of jewelry, at such a great price. <end>  Simple and yet beautiful!  Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it... She also previously received a &#34;mother's necklace&#34; from this series (for a Mother's Day) and now I just need to get her another birthstone to add to that one as well.  -) <end>  Great gift  My husband bought this for my daughter. I have always worn one with just her and I. Now with a new addition I was going to hand mine down to her but she hasn't taken it off since - nor have I. <end>  chain broke quickly  would have gotten a 5 if the chain didn't break the second time she wore it, bought a new one this week and its fine <end>  Sterling silver loving family heart necklace  I gave it as a gift but it was so tiny, I did feel a big embarrased to give it away. If I had more time I would have sent it back and tried for a larger pendant. <end>  Wife Christmas  My wife loves it. She doesn't like big and flashy. It was just the right size with just the right shine. <end>  awesome gift idea  My boyfriend had one sibling that died 10 years ago. I got this pendant for his mom for Christmas. She really loved it. <end>  Perfect!  I love the way the shape of the family creates a heart. Beautifully constructed and wonderfully made. Was purchased for my daughter in honor of her role as mother. A perfect gift <end>  Gift  This is hard to find in any stores. I bought my wife the mom and child one which is nice. This is better both parents two kids. Very pretty seems durable. <end>  Wife says its the "Best Xmas Gift Ever."  My wife opened this for Xmas and she loves it! I knew she'd like it but I was pleasantly surprised at how much she did. It is very elegant and beautiful. The shine is much better than I expected. It looks great around her neck. She said she'll wear it daily.THANK U AMAZON. <end>  Beautiful!  Bought this for my mom and sister. Has a really nice durable chain and the charm is a perfect size. Came in a cute box also! <end>  Love this necklace!  I was so happy to get this necklace from my husband for Christmas. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's a little bit smaller and thinner than I had anticipated. I don't remember if it had the specifications under the description? From far away, it looks like of like a flip flop (like those pendants you can get in Florida or Hawaii) but everyone who has seen it loves it too!! I am very happy with this product overall. <end>  you get what you pay for  The pendent is nice enough quality. Even though it was smaller than I expected, I should have read the measurements more carefully. So that's my fault for not realizing it would be so small. The chain the pendent came with tarnished in less than a week. Expect to use an alternate chain for this pendent if you buy. <end>  Perfect size.  I showed this pendant to my husband to see what he thought of it. He really liked it and purchased it for me for Mother's Day. I like it better in person that online. The silver is beautiful and it is the perfect size. I have seen others like it in gold and have not liked all of them. It was such a good price that it makes an easy give to give. <end>  Piece of junk  Purchased for my wife for Valentine's day and the item is defective, not to mention cheap looking. The chain is not attached to the clasp - not broken, just purely a defective item. Unfortunately it adds more frustration that I am 1 month past the return window when I finally get around to doing something about it. <end>  This item has gotten HIGHER AND HIGHER in PRICE!!!  I have been wanting to purchase this over 3 years, but because of lack of money havent been able to. Originally, this was in the 20$ range and I thought, I can get one for me and my 2 sisters. Yeah right. For this price, now 40$. Im better off just drawing a picture because it will have the same effect. I am very dissapointed by this product because the price just keeps on getting higher and I am not going to spend 130 dollars or whatever for 3 of them. Just ridiculous. Thanks for UPING the price! <end>  Super cute...  I bought one for a friend of mine and trust me when I say I want one for me, love it... Made well and I hope my friend likes it as much as I did.. <end>  Family necklace  It looked nice in the picture...but when I received it, I was not impressed at all and know it would not be something my daughter would appreciate. It was way to small and just not what I know she would have wanted. <end>  Beautiful!  This necklace was purchased as a gift. It is very pretty and looks better than the picture on-line. I would recommend this to anyone. <end>  Beautiful  It's beautiful and it will be a nice going away to college gift for my daughter, to have her family representation always with her! <end>  The sterling silver loving family heart necklace is very nice! It is a gift item, and I think my daughter in law will like it.  I would recommend this item. For the price and quality it is a great purchase! It comes in an attractive gift box also. <end>  Very pleased  I looked all over for the perfect gift for my daughter-in-law when she gave birth to their second child. This was just what I was looking for and at such a reasonable price. I even appreciated the sentiment on the box. I couldn't be more pleased. <end>  nice shpe but smaller than I thought  Color and shine nice a popular design but smaller than than I thought it would be, still a nice product for a mother <end>  Made her smile!  This is a great product. I got it for my wife for mothers day and she was touched. Great quality and the box it came in was nice. I would recommend this product. <end>  Great gift!  I bought this for my wife for our anniversary and she was happy with it. She gets so many compliments on the necklace. <end>  Perfect!  My husband got this for me for Mother's Day. It is very light weight, but doesn't feel cheap at all. It is very shiny and is a great size. I love it and wear it on a daily basis. I'm so glad he bought it for me! Worth every penny! <end>  I'm the wife who loved it!  My husband bought this for me for Christmas. I cried when I opened it. It came in a beautiful yet simple blue velvet box. My husband said he thought the chain was going to be longer, but that was just a miscalculation on his part. The chain is sturdy - my 2 1/2 year old loves to yank on it. I've worn it every day without taking it off since Christmas Day, 2007, and it is still shiny and sturdy. It is also a conversation piece - several friends and co-workers have commented on it. I work in a school and even my students have made nice comments about it (that's a lot coming from 4th and 5th graders!)I would recommend this necklace to anyone who is interested in having a familial piece. Truly lovely. <end>  Lovlier than you think  I purchased several of these necklaces as Mother's Day gifts this year. I must say that they are much lovlier than they appear online. They have a bit of sparkle to them that you can't tell from the picture or even when they are in the box. But the sparkle is quite noticeable when worn. Everyone loved their gifts, and I was happy that they were happy. The price is more than reasonable for such a beautiful gift. So, don't let the picture online fool you. These necklaces are beautiful. <end>  I love it!  This is a beautiful necklace. I have more expensive necklaces but this is my favorite. The pendant is very well made and very pretty and the chain has lots of sparkle. It is a short chain, but you need neckaces of every length depending on what you are wearing. I work in the medical field, so I wear scrubs all day. The length of the chain is perfect to wear with my uniform as it falls right in the V-neck. I If you are a man and considering buying this, go for it. Women love things with sentimental meaning and she will likely love this and the thought behind it, even if it is inexpensive. It does not look cheap though, I love it!I plan on getting one for my friend who is newley divorced, but one with one with just one parent. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful!  I received this necklace for Mother's Day and I love it! Like other reviews have stated there is a sparkle and shine to it that doesn't show up in the pictures. The chain that comes with the necklace is very sturdy, so I wear mine all the time even when I sleep. With two children, most of my chains would have snapped. I would definately recommend this necklace as a gift to any Mother. <end>  Not what I thought it would be  I had seen this necklace at a fair and unfortunately did not purchase it there. I was happy to see it available on Amazon. This one is smaller than I thought it would be and it is not made well. Cheap is the accurate word to describe it. <end>  Loving Family 4 person charm  My wife loved it! We just welcomed our newborn daughter to make us officially 4! It looks great and she won't be taking it off anytime soon. <end>  I love this pendant!  This is a wonderful pendant. My husband gave it to me for Christmas and I haven't taken it off. It has held up great and I get tons of complements on it! It's the perfect size and reminds me daily of my family. I love it! <end>  Parents and 2 children necklace  This was a gift for my daughter-in-law who is expecting her second child and she loved it and wears it often. For the price, it is a very nice necklace. <end>  She loved it  I bought this for my daughter-in-law. The sentiment was so appropriate. However, the chain was not long enough as other reviewers commented. Luckily she had another chain. So, other than that it was a perfect gift. <end>  Bought it for my mom, and she loved it!  I bought this necklace for my mom for Christmas, and she loves it! It comes in a pretty box with a certificate of family that you can sign on the back, and it is small but detailed. <end>  Nice pendent  I have bought three of these as gifts. They are beautiful pendents, the chain is mid-line ... what you would expect for the price. They make a perfect "Thanks for my new grandbaby gift!"  ) <end>  Needs a longer chain  It's a pretty charm. The chain is a bit too short for me. I like it. <end>  I love my family necklace!!!!  Absolutely beautiful! It is more then I thought it would be when it arrived!! Shipping was pretty fast!! And just over all really pleased! <end>  Love my "Loving Family"  I received my beautiful "Loving Family" before Christmas (it was a gift to me from my husband and children) and love it! The pendant seems to be very well made, of good weight (not flimsy), and beautiful. I plan to replace the light-weight box chain with a better quality chain. Only one negative comment - and it's not that negative - and that is the fact that I received the necklace in a little cardboard/windowed package, not a gift box as pictured in the detail pictures listed with the product. I would buy from this seller in the future. <end>  Why I rate it 4 ****  It was a gift for my girlfriend. She thought i was like many mens that dont need kids. When I gave it to her, she was like waw excited. She's my wife now and we plan to materialize this pendant. Become a complete family.Loving Family (R) Small Sterling Silver 2Parent/2Child Pendant <end>  Beautiful gift  This was a lovely gift for my daughter in law who just gave birth toher little girl, making theirs a 4 member family, mom - dad - son - daughter. She was thrilled with the meaning of family and my little grandson enjoyed wearing it too. <end>  Beautiful Family Pendant  My husband just purchased this pendant for my Christmas gift and I LOVE IT!! It is absolutely beautiful, much prettier in person. It's the perfect symbol for a loving family of four. It's the perfect size as well, it isn't really that small, but I checked the measurements first and knew what I was getting. Anything larger would be gaudy. <end>  Magnificent Gift with a Personal Touch  I received this item as a birthday gift from my sister and I absolutely love it. I am not a big jewelry buff- but this is perfect  tasteful, elegant, personal. I have had no problems with tarnishing as others have mentioned. . . and I wear the pendant quite frequently. One detail I couldn't make out in the picture is the texture. Certain areas of the pendant have been machined- which give those areas a softer, brushed look. I am so happy my sister chose this pendant for me- she couldn't have gotten a better buy- I love it! <end>  Silver Pendant  Extremely fast delivery! Beautiful piece of jewelry! Description by seller was exactly as the item looked. My daughter-in-law is truly going to enjoy this CHRISTmas gift. <end>  Family Together  I obtained all that i needed known about the product in the specificationsIt's perfect for a mother's day gift <end>  Charming  I really enjoy wearing this. I have worn it every day since receiving it and will probably buy one for my sister's birthday. The chain is sturdy and the family design is unique. Thank you. <end>  When you're ready to turn a duo into a quartet...  My wife and I had been planning on starting a family around two years into our marriage. About a year and a half in I could tell she was getting antsy to start. So, taking that hint, I bought her this pendant as a way of telling her I was ready to turn our two into three. It took her completely by surprise and became her favorite Christmas present by far even though it was probably the least expensive one I bought her.Since then she has never taken it off. And yes, as one other reviewer noted, this thing stands up well against the tugs and pulls of little children. We have lots of little nieces and nephews and not one of them has been able to break the chain yet.So husbands  if your wife wants kids and you're ready to signal the green light, this is the way to do it. I promise you'll be in her good graces for months to come. <end>  Love this and hubby done good!  My husband gave me this for mother's day. Part of what makes it so special is that it's two kids - our infant son died in November. Even though he's not here, he's still an important part of our family and this pendant expresses that for me. <end>  Loving Family  LOVE this necklace! Especially the message on the back of the box re  family values. I have one of my own and have given it as birthday gifts to my sister and best friend who love it! I wear mine everyday!The chain tarnished quickly on mine so I replaced it with another chain. <end>  Very pretty.  Gave as a gift to step-daughter...I thought it was lovely, she seemed to like it but eh, who can tell? (that would mean she'd have to like something I picked out... LOL...) Seriously, it's a beautiful necklace and represents the family quite nicely... I have three children otherwise I would have kept it for myself  ) <end>  Loved it  I bought this for my very close friends birthday today who just had her second baby. It was a perfect gift for her and she absolutely loved it. The necklace and pendant looked gorgeous on her and she got lots of compliments for it. I'm so happy I chose something so precious and meaningful. <end>  Perfect  Got this for daughter in law when she had second child. 18" chain may be a little short for some but it was perfect for her as she is petite. Fast shipping <end>  Loving family silver necklace  This is a very pretty necklace which I bought for my daughter for Christmas. She hasn't seen it yet. It arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted. <end>  Nice Gift  Loving Family Sterling Silver Pendant met all my expectations plus some. Even though it has not yet been delivered to my daughter in law as a Christmas gift, I am certain that she will love it! I am very proud to have such a nice gift at a reasonable price. <end>  Family pendant  This is to be a Christmas gift for my daughter. It's just the right size.....could be worn all the time. <end>  excellent price, beautful pendant  I bought this for my wife for a thanks for having our second child gift.I think it is a perfect size, but if you are into larger pendants, do get out a ruler and think about the large sized version.My wife likes more sedate and smaller jewelery (lucky me) so she liked it as is.Silver does tarnish, so don't expect white gold... anyway. They have a vermeil version for more money, but I'm happy with this one... leaves more money for diapers. <end>  Decent Necklace  My daughter picked this out for her mother for Christmas. I really don't know much about jewelry so take this review with a grain of salt. My daughter was happy to pick out a gift and her mother enjoyed it as well. It wasn't cheap looking and that's about as far as my expertise goes with jewelry. <end>  love this!  got for my mom for mothers day. she loved it! fit nice, has lasted a long time, still looks great! perfect for mothers! <end>  Exactly what it is.  I am pleased with this. I love it! It's simplicity is what it makes it very special. I feel great when I wear it because it's a sentimental pendant. Great quality and very pretty. <end>  Love it!  Very happy with purchase! Very inexpensive gift reinforcing family. Came very quickly and in good shape. Would buy it again. <end>  Beatiful  Absolutely gorgeous!!! Gave it to a friend after her 2nd child and she cried in delight!!! It is a meaningful piece to last a lifetime! <end>  Not as described  I had originally bought this item and gave it a glowing review... That was until discovering that the pendant although labeled as being sterling silver isn't actually sterling silver. See my added product image to see it failing the simple magnet test. Silver is non magnetic, pendant is supposed to be 92.5% silver 7.5% some other metal usually copper which is also non magnetic. Pendant is being misrepresented in my opinion as silver when it is not. <end>  Nice Pendant  This pendant is nice but the description did not include the white in lay. For the money I thought it was over priced. <end>  Gift for wife  My wife says she loves this pendant.She says the chain doesn't catch in her hair at all as her hair is long. Item as described. Shipping was very fast. Completely satisfied. Thanks! <end>  christmas present  the necklace was gorgeous, i bought it for my mom for christmas and she loved it. would recommend this everyone. <end>  nice necklace  Its a cute small necklace. We gave it to a friend, and she loved it! I like that it has many variations to acknowledge the different configurations of families. <end>  Worth every penny!!!  I bought this as a college graduation gift for my oldest daughter because I wanted to give her something special and personal. I wasn't sure if she would like it, she is funny about different types and sizes of jewelry. Being she had been a foster mother for two sisters and then officially adopted them in 2010 I thought I would take a chance. Well, she loves it and she said she was never going to take it off. It really means so much to her because she is so grateful for her new family. The pendent is more beautiful in person than the picture. If you are thnking of getting something unique and personal as a keepsake this is the perfect gift. <end>  does not bother my nickel allergy  I LOVE this necklace. My husband bought it for me for Christmas, just after I became pregnant with our second child. What I really love about this necklace is that I am able to wear it! I have a nickel allergy, and usually when I wear silver chains it makes the back of my neck itch and causes hives(because the chain is silver but the clasp is not)! I am so happy to say the clasp of this necklace seems to be nickel free, probably silver as well. I can wear it all day with no irritation. I have worn it many times. It is the only silver necklace chain I have been able to wear. I am SO happy with it! And, besides that, it is a really adorable pendant and I have gotten several comments on it. <end>  Beautiful  I just got this necklace and I LOVE it. I wear it everyday and it is my favorite necklace. My family always says morning prayers together and it reminded me of me, my husband, daughter, and son holding hands and thanking the Lord for all of our blessings and for the great day we are going to have. I will definately be buying more from this seller. Necklace is also great quality..chain was just the right length and it's much more beautiful in person...the pictures doesn't do this charm justice. I'm probably going to be buying more of the family necklaces for gifts. <end>  Lovely!  This necklace is lovely. It is finely crafted, simple and elegant.The picture does not do it justice!The chain is sturdy, perfect for everyday wear.Well worth the money! <end>  Best Birthday Gift Ever...  I LOVE THIS NECKALCE! This necklace was the best birthday gift ever from my husband. We are currently expecting our 2nd child, so this necklace said it all, a happy family. Looking at the photo on Amazon, you would think the charm is more 3D, but it is not. The children are quite flat, which is fine, it is absolutely beautiful. It does look so beautiful in person, the picture doesn't do justice.I see other reviews complaining of the chain being too short.. yes it is a shorter chain, but it is the perfect length for me. I don't want my necklace hanging down very far. It shows off perfectly on the vneck of my work shirt.I have recieved so many compliments on this necklace so far. It just shows the value of family and I can't say it enough how much I absolutely love it. This is a great gift that can be from anyone and would be a treasured gift! <end>  UH OH  I think I may have ordered the wrong pendant. I think it was supposed to be the parents w/ 2 children, not Mom w/ 2 children. Since I ordered this as a Christmas gift, & the 30 days return will expire before it is opened... will I be able to return it after it is opened at Christmas if I did mess up?Silly Mother in Law <end>  Excellent gift for that mother in your life  I got this for my wife, she absolutely loves it! Of all the pendants I've gotten her, this understandably is her favorite and of course the one she wears all the time. While I rate the pendant 5 stars, I rate the chain itself a 1.5 . Plan on using another chain or purchasing a separate one which I bought here on Amazon at what I thought was a great price. It's been a year now that she's had it and it still looks and holds up great, both the pendant and the separate chain I bought to go with it. <end>  Love This Piece....  This is by far my favorite piece of jewelry. It is so beautiful, and says alot about who I am. Very reasonably priced. Wear it like its a million bucks! Love it! <end>  Nice keepsake...  Purchased as a gift. Packaged well - a box within a box, bubble wrapped, etc. It's not quite as "3 dimensional" as it appears - not as rounded. I guess that would make it a little more comfortable to wear..? Would definitely be something that I myself would wear though...very pretty! <end>  Christmas gift  I like the box it came in though you had to sort of set it up in the box to be presented (it was in a little plastic baggie in the box and you had to take it out and hook it on so you could see it displayed through the clear lid). I wish they hadn't stuck a sticker on the side of the box - it was difficult to get off and left it sticky. They could have put it on the bottom where it wouldn't have been noticeable. The necklace itself is very sweet and I look forward to giving it to my sister. <end>  beautiful  so my husband bought this for me as a gift, when he was deployed. and when i recieved it i cried (i was preggo at the time, so i was wayy emotional) its the best gift i have recieved (besides my kiddos) its a perfect way to express the love of a family <end>  Good gift  Bought this as a christmas present for my wife. She and the family members she showed all liked it a lot. As others have said, the chain is not long, but my wife is average sized, and the chain fit fine.The packaging was simple and while not much more than utilitarian, it was not unattractive.For the money, I don't think I could have gotten her a better gift. <end>  AMAZING GIFT!!  I gave this to my best friend as a gift for making me God-Mother to her newborn. She has not taken it off since. This is truly unique and says it all. I would recommend this! <end>  Beautiful!!!  I absolutely LOVE this necklace! I like that it's not the traditional baby's head hanging from your neck...never did like those. This is a contemporary art piece. I can't believe it's only $25! My only complaint is that I wish they would have offered it in white gold. So very pleased! This makes a great Mother's Day gift!=) <end>  Just as described  This pendant is beautiful and just as described. I'd definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  Beautiful keepsake  This is the prettiest "Loving Family" necklace that I found online. I love the heart shape formed by the family. Beautiful silver. <end>  Wonderful!!!!  My wife loved it and it looks very nice with anything she wears. I got the smaller of the two but I think if you got the bigger one it would work out fine too. Surprise the one you love and just get it. <end>  Just the perfect size  I ordered this for a co-worker's 40th birthday. It's a perfect sized pendant,& it looks lovely around the neck. She had given a similar one as a gift, though at the time I ordered this I didn't know that fact. Knowing her as I do, she would only give something she herself would like to receive. It is definitely worth the price. <end>  family necklace  I have been looking for a necklace like this for a long time. I was so excited to find it and a such a resonable price. I am very pleased with the necklace.P. Harris <end>
 B000PAOC6I  Sterling Silver, Mother-of-Pearl and Garnet Flower Pendant by Sajen ||	  Pleased  I was very pleased with the quality of the piece of jewelry for the price I paid. Very nice <end>  Beautiful mother of pearl pendant, with a dangling flower embellishment.  I like this pendant a lot, it's about 2 inches long. The base is oval mother of pearl that has a nice pink-blue sheen and measures roughly 1.5 inches.On top is a little flower - about half inch in length - dangling below a tiny garnet stone set in sterling silver. In the picture above, the flower seemed fixed on the mother of pearl, but on receiving the pendant I realized that it is mobile and adds to the charm of the pendant.I love the fact that the mother of pearl rests against your skin as opposed to some designs where it is framed with metal and does not touch your skin. According to Indian and Chinese writings, mother of pearl has a beneficial influence of awakening your feelings of love and compassion. As the mother of pearl shell nurtures the pearl inside it is supposed to make one who wears it against the skin enhance their ability to love, nurture and prosper. It may be my imagination but I feel more peaceful and giving when I put on this pendant. <end>  Christmas gift  My husband gave me this pendant as a gift for Christmas and I LOVE it! The mother-of-pearl is bright without being flashy. The garnet makes a lovely contrast and the piece is the perfect size. Not to big to look gaudy, but not to small to get lost with your outfit. <end>
 B000PAOD5I  Sterling Silver Free-Form Green Fluorite Adjustable Ring by Sajen, Size 6 ||	  Very cute ring  The stone does not look much like the picture (the stone is more translucent), but the ring is still very nice. Worthwhile if you catch it on sale. <end>
 B000PAOD62  Sterling Silver Cabochon Peridot Dangle Earrings by Sajen ||	  Dinky  These were not quite what I expected. They look more "substantial" in the photo. The length is described as 1" - which it just BARELY is - from the tip-top of the curve of the earwire to the bottom of the earring. When it said 1" I stupidly thought it meant just the dangle itself (not including earwire). In general, it's a LOT more dainty looking than I had anticipated. <end>
 B000PAODO4  Sterling Silver Carved Cinnabar Butterfly Pendant by Sajen, 18" ||	  Beautiful  I got these and matching earrings for Christmas for a friend and you would have thought I had given her the moon! She absolutely loved them and raves about them still. I didn't realize when I purchased them that the 'stones' are really dull, the only shine comes from the silver, but this is the way Cinnabar is, very unique. I will be back to purchase more Cinnabar for my friend for her birthday.I've ordered other items from Sajen and have always been happy with the product, fast shipping and quality. <end>
 B000PAODOY  Sterling Silver Adjustable Carved Dyed Cinnabar Ring by Sajen, Size 5 ||	  Beautiful ring...can't beat the price!  I bought this ring for myself while Sajen jewelry was on sale for 30% off. After getting the ring, I added several more of these beautiful pieces to my wish list. <end>
 B000PAODVW  Sterling Silver Scroll Design Quartz Ring by Sajen, Size 5 ||	  not as pictured  disappointing. overly shiny and is adjustable--that may be in the description, but i didn't see it. And though i decided to return the ring, Amazon's return policy made it extremely easy, and best of all--return shipping is free! Thank you, Amazon, you rock!! <end>
 B000PAOHBI  Loving Family Sterling Silver Heart Pendant - Couple ||	  Beautiful Remembrance  Pendant Loving Family Sterling / B000PAOHBII received this from my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. I'd been looking at it online forever and when he asked if I'd like anything this year, I couldn't resist. I'm always concerned about ordering jewelry "unseen" online, but this pendant was worth every penny.The silver is bright and shiny and completely without any blemish or scratch. The necklace chain is of high quality, with a good strong clasp. The necklace chain is small enough that you can remove it from the pendant, if you decide to switch out the existing chain with another (although since the necklace is of such high quality, you won't need to switch out the chain unless you just want a different length).The picture here is a little hard to judge for depth, but another reviewer noted that the pendant is "flat", so I knew what to expect. In person the "body" of the couple is a thin, flat sheet of silver, and the "arms" are raised and form a delicate heart shape that stands out from the pendant. The "heads" are rounded and perfectly conceal the rounded loop on the back through which the chain passes.This pendant is absolutely stunning, and I'm certain that we will be "upgrading" to one of the other family pendants, should a little bundle of joy decide to come along in a few years.~ Ana Mardoll <end>  Good  I wear it everyday, but it doesn't look very well, the &#34;left people&#34; in the heart is not brilliant. I mean it looks not very delicate. My friend says looks like a slipper. <end>
 B000PAOHCM  Sterling Silver Loving Family Heart Necklace Featuring a Loving Mother and Her Child ||	  Really Beautiful  This is a very beautiful necklace.

I think that it is a beautiful piece of jewelry.The chain is also a good piece of jewelry.She recieves so many compliments on it.I plan on getting the couples necklace as soon as I can.Recommend all that are considering to buy NOW!! It is beautiful!! <end>  A Perfect Pendant  I bought this necklace for my mum as a Christmas present, and I'm happy to say that she loved it! It is high quality, very shiny and simply beautiful, definitely worth the money.The box that came with it was not the one pictured here, which didn't bother me, but it might some people. It came in a hot pink box that said "A Loving Family" on the top of it. <end>  Awesome  This product was shipped very quickly and is beautiful. I live in NY and was shipped from mexico ans was at my door within a week. It is so beautiful and packaged so nice. I can't wait to give this to my daughter for Christmas!! <end>  Just beautiful  I received this pendant for Christmas and LOVE it. I actually have 2 kids but chose this one because the mother and child's arms make a heart shape. I've received tons of compliments on the necklace and I think it is just gorgeous and high-quality. <end>  Beautiful necklace.  I really liked this necklace and I saw it on another coworker, so I found it online and ordered it. It is exactly what I wanted and very nice. <end>  Great buy  Its beautiful and reminds me of my son whenever I touch it ). Perfect length and goes with anything I wear! <end>  Lovely necklace  I bought this necklace for my daughter-in-law for Christmas and she loves it! It is sturdy, yet feminine and I look forward to getting her another version one of these days as well! <end>  Great product. Good quality.  The necklace was purchased as a gift from my son to his mother. It was a hit. She loved the message and the quality of the necklace.Would by from this seller again. <end>  Super cute...  I bought one for a friend of mine and trust me when I say I want one for me, love it... Made well and I hope my friend likes it as much as I did.. <end>  Perfect  I love this pendant/necklac! It is perfect as I expected. The 3 person figure (dad, mom, child) was my due date present from my husband (ex) when I was pregnant with our son. I was so sad to not wear this after we split becuase it was my favorite necklace. My son (4) noticed that I wasn't wearing it and I told him that would be something he could get me for Christmas so we ordered it and it is under the tree! I think we're both excited. This really is a great product. The other one I had was from bought from here too and is still in great condition and well loved. <end>  lloveeeeddd it!  I bought this for a present for myself after the birth of my son. I think its super cute and wear it everyday. So far, no tarnish. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the chain broke about a month in randomly. I figured I would have to replace the chain at some point considering I have a little one, I figured he'd pull the chain too hard and break it. But it broke without that. I was glad i heard it fall though, I put the charm on a stronger chain and its been great ever since. <end>  Great Buy  The quality of this product was great. When my grandmother opened it her eyes filled up in tears. It is a beautiful gift. <end>  Made a mom happy on Mothers Day  Bought this as a gift for my wife on Mothers Day. It was a huge hit. It seems to capture her love and devotion to our child in a cute design that she immediately connected with. <end>  i absolutely love it!  I love this necklace! It's so beautiful I wear it everywhere I go. I also love the chain its seems to be very durable  ) I searched everywhere for a cute necklace like this but not even Kay jewlers had one this one is my favorite. I would recommend this item to others its perfect for a gift whoever you get it for or if its for yourself everyone will love it. <end>  Mom in law loved it!  Got this for my Mom in law for mothers day. She is a single mom who raised my husband alone. I love the options and how you can personalize the family. I think I will be getting one for my own mom next year.The chain is very dainty, but does seem very sturdy. The pendant is pretty and has a nice weight to it. It doesn't look or feel cheap at all, which I was slightly worried about because of the price. Recommended. <end>  Not worth for this much money  Pendent and chain is very thin and small.It's not worth for this much money.Shipping was faster and pendent looks good just very small and thin. <end>  Great necklace for single moms!  I'm the only child of a single mom so this was a great necklace to give my mom for Valentine's Day. The chain is shoddy but I knew that going in (as it IS stainless...) so I won't take off a star for that. The pendant is GREAT! And it's so hard to find a single mom/single child gift. This was perfect and my mom absolutely loved it  D <end>  Beautiful and simple  The sterling silver makes it easy to keep clean and shiny.The chain is of great quality, very easy to adjust, and it will fit most size of women.The pendant is perfect in size, people will notice she is wearing it, but it is not flashy.It is a great gift for any single mother. It does not matter if it is a friend or a co-worker, or even your own mother. <end>  Very Nice Necklace  I bought this necklace as a present to myself. I was having problems finding "Mom" type jewelry that reflected me as a single mother with 1 child. I had to have this as soon as I laid eyes on it.Very nice box chain and is presented nicely.Have had many compliments from other moms who love the style.This would make a nice gift for any mother,and although the other styles do not apply to me(2 parents,multi-child)they would work for traditional families and domestic partnerships. <end>  lovely gift item and just what my friend wanted  thanks so much - pretty sterling pendant and chain for a great price - lovely simple lines, and my friend says it is one of her very favorite things <end>  Not as it appears to be...  When I saw this item I thought it would be a perfect stocking stuffer for my wife. However, when the item arrived it did not look like the picture. Instead of being silver through and through, the mother in the piece has a white strip going down the front of it. This is not what I ordered and it is not visually appealing. Had this been clear in the picture, I would not have made the purchase. <end>  Great  Great item! Brought my girlfriend to tears, since her husband isn't in to this stuff. Great for first child! <end>  Loveliness and moving  The necklace was as lovely as I expected it to be. It came in a lovely box with an explanation. It was a lovely gift and I would totally recommend it. <end>  compliments  I get many compliments on this style of necklace. Like the 3D design of it. <end>  A lovely symbol.  I bought this for my daughter, who, after great difficulty conceiving a child, through the miracles of modern reproductive science was finally able to give birth to her own beautiful daughter. This pendant is a beautiful symbol of the wonder that is my granddaughter. <end>  Beautiful pendant, but get your own chain  I received this for mother's day and absolutely love it! It's such a sweet image of a mother with her child, their arms forming a heart. It's not quite as shiny as it looks in the image, but it's still a nice piece of jewelry, especially for the price.My only complaint was the chain it came on. My daughter gave it a slight tug while I was wearing it, and it snapped in two, not in a fixable way. I now have it on my own silver chain, and I wear it daily.Any mom would love this necklace! <end>  Dissapointed  Item was not as it appeared...item was supposed to be all silver but mine had this white material on the mother's front. Very dissapointed! !! <end>  Very nice sterling piece!  This is a very pretty sterling silver piece of jewelry for the single woman with one child. I intend to give it as a Christmas gift to the daughter of a good friend. <end>  GREAT GIFT, BUT SMALL  This item is very beautiful. My mom wears it everyday since I got it for her and just loves it. When I opened the package, the only thing that got me a bit upset was that it was small and I always compare the priced to the item. Overall, I' am very pleased except for the size and the price. Maybe 20 dollars would've been more reasonable. <end>  Very nice  This is a beautiful gift for moms, the material and the finish of the pendant are really nice, totally recommended! <end>  Loving Mother & Child Pendant  The quality & price are AWSOME! My girls loved them & wear them daily.Purchased this pendant, representing the mother & child, as Christmas present for my daughters. They LOVED them & wear them almost daily. Wonderful price & quality is awesome!Purchased this pendant for my daughters last year as a Christmas present - they all LOVED them. Very nice quality & price <end>  Beautiful necklace  I will soon be a single mom to an infant child. I purchased this for myself as an early mother's day gift. It's perfect! <end>  great gift  purchased this for my 2 year old son to hand his mom on christmas morning. It is beautiful and one of her favorite pieces of jewelry. It didnt hurt when that sweet youngun said " I bought dis fo you mommy" <end>  Perfect  This was exactly what I was hoping for. I got it for my sister who recently found out she was pregnant. <end>  Very pleased  The product arrived ontime and was beautiful. Good quality for a good price and good service. <end>  Beautiful  Beautiful necklace. Gave it to my daughter and she loves it to. Very worth the price. It is well made and comes nicely packaged. You won't be disappointed if you get one <end>  Empty Box  No Stars and an upset customer. Purchased at Amazon  Imagine, it's a friend's birthday party and you have an Amazon gift. She opens the box and it's empty, Some 50 guests are looking and the birthday girl is dismayed. I paid to have the gift wrapped. The gift box is EMPTY. Empty. I am mortified. I want this gift sent directly to my friend and in a gift box AT NO CHARGE to me. I am VERY UPSET. <end>
 B000PAQBLM  Sterling Silver, Amethyst and Mother-of-Pearl Dangle Earrings by Sajen ||	  just as advertised!  Beautiful and exactly like the picture. They are large, about an inch and a half in length, so don't be surprised! <end>  Beautiful earrings  These are very pretty earrings. They area little heavier than I like my earrings but not awful. They are larger than they look in the picture and, since I'm not good with metric, didn't realize how large. But, I am pleased and will wear them. <end>  Earrings  The workmenship on this item is absoulutly beautiful. I did not keep these earrings because they where to large for me. If they had been sized smaller they would of been just perfect.  ) Sajen has beautiful work, one of a kind! <end>
 B000PAQBU8  Sterling Silver Garnet Ring by Sajen, Size 6 ||	  Beautiful  I ordered this ring for a friend at the bargain price of $15. The ring is well made and the garnet is beautiful. The stone is clear and sparkles. I'm happy with the purchase. <end>
 B000PAQD42  Sterling Silver Hsiu Jade Leaf Dangle Earrings by Sajen ||	  Yuck. Sent them back  These earrings are inadequately described on Amazon's site. Perhaps hsiu jade is a particular color of jade, but I'm not familiar with it and there was no color description offered on Amazon. In the pictures posted on the site they appear to be black, which was what I was expecting to receive. How wrong I was. The earrings I received were a dark brownish/green color that resembled what my dog leaves behind when I take her for a walk. Were they black, as shown on the site (or any other acceptable shade) they would be lovely, but no way was I going to wear petrified dog poo earrings. Back they went. <end>
 B000PAQD5Q  Sterling Silver, Rainbow Moonstone and Garnet Earrings by Sajen ||	  Daytime to Evening Earrings  These are a favorite pair of earrings. They are equally suitable for daytime and evening wear, and look especially nice when paired with my moonstone and turquoise pendant (from Amazon.com)Oxidized Sterling Silver Pendant, Bead/Scroll, Turquoise, 7mm Moonstone, 1 3/16 in (incl bail). The moonstones seem to glow softly in the light. These delicate-looking earrings are nicely designed, and look stunning on petite ears. <end>
 B000PARWSI  Sterling Silver and Stainless Steel Mizpah Medal Necklace, 20" and 24" ||	  Mizpah necklace  I bought this for me and my husband for Christmas. He was so surprised and happy to wear with me. I had given him a key ring with the mizpah years ago...he still has his..i lost mine. So happy to have the necklaces now! <end>  I love it  I absolutely love this item. The size really does not bother as I dont wear a large amount of jewlery anyway. I plan on giving the other half to my girlfriend and I dont have to worry about putting it on a chain or putting it in a gift box as both of these are included in the purchase. VERY NICE BUY <end>  Mizpah medal  My son bought these necklaces for he and his girlfriend.....they love them. And quick delivery on them as well. Would recommend them to others. <end>  Very nice for price  I bought these for my wife cos' she wanted something we could wear together. She loves them. <end>  Awesome!  Mi girl like it very much...after she saw it she was so happy u can even imagine... <end>  Broken  (  I purchased this as a gift to my fiance as he recently took a job out of state. He loved the gift and initally I was very happy with the purchase. However, the second time I wore my half the chain(the smaller of the two) it completely snapped. I was very disappointed and am now searching for a replacement chain. <end>  opinion of sale of mizpah coins & necklaces  I was a little disapointed when they came in the mail - I expected them to be a little larger than they were. Maybe an "actual size" description would be helpful on further sales (of ?all products). Otherwise, my wife & I are happy we finally (after about 15 yrs) got them (to wear) again. <end>  Read the context!  Makers of religious tchotchkes may want to make a rule for themselves  read the context of any verses you quote. This isn't a cute prayer telling someone you miss them and care about them. It's a warning from Laban to his nephew Jacob. Here's the surrounding text in a contemporary translation Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne? Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me." So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore he named it Galeed, and Mizpah, for he said, "The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight. If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me." (Genesis 31 43-50 ESV)In other words, Laban is giving Jacob a not-so-veiled threat  don't mess with my daughters, or God will get you! <end>  Great for Couples who cant be together  I purchaced this item for me and my boyfriend that is currently in another state. Not by choice i assure you. But i thought that this would be a nice present for both of us to keep our hearts closely together while we were seperated by hundreds of miles. <end>  mizpah  I bought these for my boyfriend and myself..They are so beautiful.. They are exactly what i thought they would look like!! My boyfriend and I LOVE them.! <end>  For my sisters'  Bought this for my sisters' birthdays'...Yes they are born on the same day, 3 years apart. They both Loved it...Thanks <end>  Valentines gift  The necklaces are very pretty and elegant for the price. It's going to be a valentines present . I was seeing that a lot of customers were saying the charm was to small like no its not ; its just about the right size classy size charm why do you want anything bigger I think that would look tacky for a couple neck lace aside of that we girls love being creative men don't love it so much but this necklace here even men would actually like wearing it without feeling to corny . Perfect beautiful necklaces . <end>  Stunning  I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. It arrived very fast and after receiving it I was blown away by how gorgeous the piece of jewelry actually is. My boyfriend was very surprised and happy with this gift and in return I am a very satisfied customer. This was the first time I have shopped on Amazon, but it will certainly not be my last. <end>  Love it but....  This is a great product...I liked the way it looked...I gave one to my girlfriend and of course kept one for myself. Unfortunately, less than a month later, the chain made her neck break out and the little hook that connected the medal to the actual chain broke on mine...shortly after my neck became a lil itcy....all in all...I was a little embarrassed because I didn't want my girlfriend thinking I brought her some fake cheap chain (luckily she isn't shallow and understood). Mad because I really loved the product. I recommend though...that for something so beautiful, the link that hooks the medal to the chain shouldn't be so cheaply made. Can't really complain about the skin irritation, I'm smart enough to know that some people just have sensitive skin. Although we don't wear the product anymore, they look good on our key chains. That's better than nothing. <end>  I am blessed to not have missed out this gift for grand-daughter and me  I was looking and really had no monies to buy, but yet I was praying someway it would happen. When I saw this here GODLY piece I just knew it was perfect for us to share on her Birthday (1-26). A voice said you can get it check again. I had check my account before and did not see the monies. So I assume that what I had to check again, and OMG I had the monies in there. I did not know I still had monies because of my bills..I just give God the Glory for it all. <end>  nice  bought this for me and my husband. we both like it and is a nice piece of jewelry and is made well. <end>  Great product!!  We love it! It is great that the chains are included. It is very well made! Would recommend this to anyone. <end>  necklace  I like it! The smaller chain does get very knotted though -( But the longer chain is fine...my boyfriend likes it. <end>  Turned dingy after a couple months  Turned dingy afer a couple of months and the gold color faded off the wording. Love the meaning of the neckless. <end>  what a great deal  My grandaughter wanted it for her and her boy friend who is in the army and will be leavening to go oversea's so I saw it and at a wonderfull price and bought it for them a after christmas gilf <end>  Mizpah birthday gift  My husband is in the Army and I sent this to him as a birthday gift and a reminder that when we are apart, my heart is only half - he has the other half. He loved it so much he cried... but don't tell him I told you that. He's supposed to be a big tough guy! <end>  Perfect  This medal is just perfect. I purchased this item as a gift for my boyfriend (and myself ;)) who was going away to a different college than I was. We wear them every day. The photo really does not do it justice. It is beautiful - very detailed and shiny. Much better than I expected.Great piece of high quality jewelry.My absolute best goes out to all long distance couples. Take care. <end>  Beautiful & Biblical  This is a beautiful symbol of loyalty and love. I purchased this for my husband for several reasons  he is a law enforcement officer; we have just weathered our first year of opening and owning a business together, and because we have nearly 25 years of a wonderful marriage together. As noted in another review, it does read, "separated one from another." It is NOT a mistake. It is biblical(from Genesis 31 49). <end>  Very pleased with Mizpah Medal and Necklaces  I bought the Mizpah Medal and Necklace set as a gift for my wife. We have always talked about how appropriate they are for committed couples. I was very pleased at her reaction when she opened her gift. The medals aren't huge or gaudy looking, they are about the size of a nickel. The necklaces are definitely silver as I have worn one since the day that she opened them. It has been through many showers and basketball games without discoloration or tarnish.For the price, you can't go wrong with this purchase. Delivery was quick. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend this item to Amazon shoppers in love. <end>  MIZPAH NECKLACE  My wife brought this necklace set for us and I love it I am in the military and whether I am at work locally or deployed I know that my soulmate and I are bonded together by our love for one another and this mizpah necklace even though we are apart. <end>  Great Gift  This mizpah necklace was perfect. I gave it to my husband and he love it. It was even better than I expected and cam beautifully displayed in a velvet gift bag in a small box. Perfect! Now we both have a necklace that reminds us of how special our relationship is. <end>  Perfect !!  This is the Perfect present ever!! its really cute and nice for two lovers ;) <end>  Product as described  The Product is as described. Amazon is very quick to get back to you about concerns. The product is beautiful in person, but does tarnish easily because it is sterling silver. I suggest not wearing it in water, as to help it not tarnish. <end>  Its a great gift!  i got this necklace for my long distance boyfriend that i don't get to see to often. i gave this to him for valentines day and he really liked it,and even decided to put it on.The pendents are kind of hard to read,but its the message that counts. i even cried while I was giving him the gift.This gift is great and the length for both partners are great! <end>  Not what i expected  This product is so cheaply made ...when i recieved the item the chain was all knotted up....not happy with this item at all. <end>  Great Value  This necklace is beautiful! The workmanship is exquisite and detail is amazing. It's a great value too and I would definitely recommend it! <end>  This necklace is beautiful . . .  I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it! It is so beautiful and so very special. The pendents are light in terms of their weight and the chains, though delicate in appearance, have a nice substantial feel to them. Highly recommend. <end>  Nice  Made my girlfriend happy. And it wasn't to pricey so I couldn't complain. Real good buy in my eyes. Thanks <end>  Love  I bought this for me and my husband and we love them! They are very very pretty! If you buy these you will love them too! They're good quality for a good price and they won't turn or discolor. We wear ours all the time. I even had our first names engraved on the back them. My name is on the one he wears, and his name is on mine. I'm really glad I bought them!!! <end>  LOVED but needs improvement  I bought this necklace set for Christmas for my boyfriend and I. I love the set and I love the meaning behind it and almost everything about it. The charms are of excellent quality and the chains are too. I haven't had a problem with the chain getting dull or green, this is real silver. I have worn this necklace every single day through sleeping, showers, swimming and working with handsy babies. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because the link that holds the charm to the chain broke on both of our necklaces. I can't keep my hands off the necklace and was able to save mine. My boyfriend on the other hand could not. He is currently in Afghanistan right now and wasn't able to hear it drop to the floor like I did and it is likely he won't find it. I am sorely disappointed and he is too. He told me he really wanted to keep it as a keepsake to remind him of my love for him.  '(Overall, I do reccomend this product however, I suggest going to Michaels or a craft store and purchasing teeny tiny keychain loops to attach to the charm. <end>  great  Its perfect for that special one birthday graduation or just a gift for thought i love it it was a good buy for me <end>  Awesome  )  I bought these necklaces for my boyfriend and I when I was leaving for college. It created a new bond between us, knowing the other was wearing the other half. I love the silver and gold to go with all jewelry! <end>  Cute  I was VERY excited when I saw these! & it looks just like the picture. Charms are a little small & thin. But over all I am satisfied. I think maybe it is priced a little high, for the quality of the charms. Chains are very good quality.(Stainless steel) Charms are fair. (Sterling silver) I'm hoping they can be worn at all times, & don't tarnish too fast or rust. <end>  Good product!  I love this! Got them for my husband and I for Valentine's Day about a year ago and they are still beautiful and shiny. I did have to get a different chain for myself, since my skin is sensitive to the stainless steel, but the mizpah medal itself is great. Would HIGHLY recommend if you are thinking about it! <end>  lovely  i love these chain perfect for a couple, the words are really nice from the bible as well and the length is perfect. <end>  Wonderful!  This is great gift for any loved one's you have! It's very affordable and the quality and packaging is very good for its cost! <end>  Nice concept.  The idea is a good one however the item is very small and quite difficult to read. Not sure why chains are different lengths. <end>  Nice as a present  I bought it for my girlfriend (and myself). She loves it, though, I have to say that it is not so nice. It gets scratched very fast and the little thing where you close and open it (I forgot the word, sorry) is not sterling silver; thus, oxidizes. The box it came with is pretty but gets ruined when taking off the tape. Nice as a gift if it is not going to be used often. But seriously, if you can, add some bucks and get something better.Overall 4 stars. <end>  Bible verse misunderstood  Beautiful piece of jewelry- but just so you know- Jacob was actually telling Laban "The Lord better keep between us, or I'm bringing the pain down on you!" (my paraphrase) Jacob had worked for his uncle for 20 years, the first seven through the deception of Laban who substituted his other daughter to marry Jacob. Here is the account of their parting 36And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban  and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?37Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.38This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.39That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.40Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.41Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle  and thou hast changed my wages ten times.42Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.43And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine  and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?44Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.46And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap  and they did eat there upon the heap.47And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha  but Jacob called it Galeed.48And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;49And Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.50If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.51And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;52This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.53The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.54Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread  and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.55And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them  and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. <end>  A pleased customer  I am absolutely pleased with this product. It is exactly what I wanted. It is the perfect gift for your significant other while away. <end>  Sturdy, solid, nice size, meaningful  I like that one chain is longer than the other for the male and the female. Not only does it mean a lot that me and my boyfriend both wear these, but I am a groomer and dogs are constantly jumping on me and not once had it ripped off our got caught. Its sturdy and is a good size. <end>  Nice for the price  Very pleased with this mitzpah pendant pair. Good quality, sturdy chains, very nice look. I think the chains are stainless steel, which means they should not turn black. The mitzpah charms themselves are sterling silver. Very fair price also. <end>  not impressed  I ordered this thinking it was completely different. When I actually received this I was not impressed. I immediately printed off a return label and sent it out the next day. $35 was a high price for such an item. The chain is not even "heavy duty". <end>  Beautifully made and a bargain price  This is a exceptionally beautiful mitzpah. The chains are strong, yet beautiful. The mitzpah itself is unlike any I have ever seen. It's nice the chains are different lengths. They are very detailed and the shine is very nice. Highly recommend this product. <end>  beautiful  beautiful coin necklace. saving it for someone special. im very happy with it, although it was a little smaller than i thought it would be. but thats ok. <end>  Very nice  I was very pleased with necklaces. Nice quality and everything was as expected as advertised. I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of necklace. <end>  Very nice!  Came in a cute box. Shipping super fast as always. I was worried because the words were hard to read on the picture but this item is a lot nicer then I thought would for sure buy again. <end>  Love this necklace  My husband and I are in love with our necklaces. The chain is nice and strong, without looking cheap, the charms are gorgeous. We have added our Christian crosses to the chain, and we haven't taken them off since we got them, and plan to wear them eternally. We got these because we had one before, but they were very chintzy compared to these and broke years ago.....and for the same price! We love amazon.com! <end>  Perfect  These necklaces are really great quality. The words are small but very detailed and readable. My best friend loves it and was so excited when she opened it. <end>  Great better than i expected  The look of this necklace is awsome I love it I got it as a gift for my girlfriend for valentines day the hearts match up an it comes with a nice little bag to wrap it in <end>  Pretty  I like that this item is stainless steel, so there isn't any tarnishing. It's absolutely beautiful...can't wait to share it! <end>  perfect!  My husband and I love these necklaces. Great quality! Good chain length. Very beautiful. Awesome anniversary present. I would definitely purchase similar items again! <end>  AMAZING PRODUCT!  My Boyfriend and I just LOVE this product! Great service! Great product! Fast service! Just all around great!  D  D <end>  Not too bad  It's seriously small, the coin, so if you like small necklace charms, then go for it. My girlfriend loves it. <end>  Just what I wanted  This is a beautiful peice of jewlery.I just wish it was a little larger. I know that my husband will love it. <end>  great present at a great price  I bought this for my girlfriend who is away for school and she absolutely loved it. You cant beat the price for this small but elegant gift. <end>  Great Choice  The item is perfect for the price, the actual coin is kinda smaller than what I expected but it works great. My boyfriend loved it. It is very clear and very nice silver, ABSOLUTLY worth the price. Greatly over-came my expectations. <end>  Amazing  I got this necklace set for my boyfriend on his birthday. I never expected him to wear his half, but he never takes it off. This is a gift that's perfect for your loved one. I'd recommend it. <end>  Absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry - thank you!  This is a real treat. I didn't know what to expect with such a low price, but this is wonderful quality - the two chains sparkle and have a good weight and the actual Mizpah coin is beautiful - I am extremely pleased with the purchase. <end>  Great gift for a couple who has everything  I purchased this necklace as a gift for my parents for Christmas. I couldn't think of anything else that they needed or wanted, and I saw this and thought it was perfect. My parents loved it. They talked about how the saying on the charms was so powerful. My mom said my dad immediately put his on and he was looking at it and smiling the whole time. Definitely a good buy! <end>  Very pleased  I ordered this product because I always wanted myself and husband to always have that little reminder that the Lord is watching over the both of us while we are apart from each other. Also the price was perfect. I love it and would recommend it to others. <end>  Lovely!  I know this was mainly meant for couples, but I got it for my cousin and myself. We're both really close, basically sisters, and this was just too sweet to pass by. They are just as lovely in person! The chains are sturdy and the overall quality is good. Great buy! <end>  mizpah necklace  My teen son got this for his girlfriend for christmas. I remember them from back when i was a teen. we couldnt find them in any stores nearby. it is better looking than i imagined it would be. the one thing i would recommend is that they used closed circle jump hooks, where the clasps attach to the chains. it makes it look a bit cheap, to solder them shut would be a better look & would add to the security of the chain. overall i am happy with the purchase. <end>  Lovely and Quite Appropriate  I enjoyed receiving it and viewing it as much as I did giving it as a gift. I gave this to my daughter and granddaughter to wear and think about each other. My daughter is away from home alot these days dealing with my terminally ill grandson and the girls of the family miss each other when she has to go away to hospitals in another city for his treatment. So I thought this would be special and each of them can wear it. They both loved the neckace and the idea and so did I and it was beautifully designed. <end>  Awesome  This set is so beautiful, I ordered two! My niece got one set from me to give as an anniversay gift for her and her husband to wear. I gave the other set to my brother and his longtime girlfriend as a Christmas gift. They were so happy she cried. I cannot express the quality of the set it is absolutely awesome!and well worth more than Amazons asking price. I have been thinking of ordering a third set for me and my husband. Just beautiful! <end>  Not What I Expected  I think that the seller might have tried to make this item look as though it was worth more in value than what it actually is, by advertising that it was marked down from a very expensive price. When in actuality, it probably wasn't previously priced for more than what I paid for it. You can believe me when I say that I would never have purchased this item for more than $20.00. But, it was claimed to have been marked down from around $100.00. I bought if for close to $25.00. In my opinion, though, the item is cheap in quality. The chains are thin and feel like they're easily breakable, and the two plates are so little and thin that, instead of regular metal they feel like di-cast metal. I was thoroughly dissappointed! <end>  My dad and stepmom loved it!  I bought it for them as a Christmas present and definitely loved the quality of the metals and the length and sturdiness of the chains. It was a perfect gift the only reason I give it 4/5 stars is because I thought the halves would be a little bit bigger and heavier. Overall a quality product! <end>  Great  Great necklace~ Had a box and velvet bag with it. Two chains. Loved it. Great item. Beautiful. Shipped quickly. Thanks <end>  so far so good  I believe it to be good quality and I do like that one has a thicker chain for a male. Awesome gift for my boyfriend who lives in another state. <end>  Amazing  My son bought this for a Christmas gift, and it arrived not just on time but early and it is a amazing gift. Beautiful and something I will cherish forever. <end>  Beautiful!  My sister & I always used to have friendship necklaces when we were little. Now having gone to the same university & joined the same sorority, this quote is symbolic in several aspects & is beautifully portrayed on this product. <end>  Nice buy  I opened package and was pleasantly surprised by how well made both necklaces were. I am giving it as an anniversary gift to my husband. It is a necklace I can see us both wearing daily. Strong and sturdy chain. Great look and meaning behind the necklace. Good buy! Wanted to add I gave it to my husband and he loved it and has not taken it off yet. Either have I! <end>  Mizpah Coin  This was a gift for my husband that is away for medical school. I searched everywhere for a git that had meaning. Because of the awesome reviews on Amazon I purchased it but was nervous. I will say that my husband and I LOVE these chains! It is good strong chains and the charms are beautiful! Day 1 of us wearing them people loved them and asked where I got them! GREAT PRODUCT!!!! <end>  Perfection  The Chains have slight difference obviously for joined couples to wear. The metal is durable and light weigth, beautiful work of art to portray the beauty that is between a couple and the Lord. <end>  love it  it is a great item for me and this friend that is half a world away from myself. it is a good Christmas gift for him. <end>  Nice price  The necklaces are beautiful & shiny. Yes the pendants are small, but I think it's in a good way. I am extremely happy with this purchase!! I will rate this item again in a few weeks after we've worn them for awhile. I absolutely recommend this product to eveybody!! <end>  great!  The necklaces were shipped and received fast. My girl loves hers. The female side by itself kinda sounds like a poem which is def a plus. Great for every relationship. <end>  Great Product  I ordered this product for my fianc&eacute;s and I because we weren't going to see one other for about 2 months. And I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. Its not too big and its simple. I also like how the mens chain is a little longer. Plus the price is great. But yes, I would recommend this product to everyone. <end>  LOVE IT!  LOOVVEE THIS NECKLACE..IT'S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND GREAT QUALITY. ARRIVED REALLY FAST TOO..PLANNING ON SURPRISING MY HUBBY WITH IT WHEN HE RETURNS FROM DEPLOYMENT..HIGHLY RECOMMEND  ) <end>  Very beautiful  I had one of these several years ago and was trying to find another but couldn't till now. This is small yet very pretty. I ordered this as a gift for my bf, because we live in 2 different states while we finish college. This piece really shines and the letters are a little small, but can still be read. It arrived on time, packaged carefully in a velvet pouch and 2 separate baggies. <end>  Great Gift  I sent this to my wife as a gift while I am in Afghanistan. It got to her very quickly. She LOVES it! Thanks! <end>  Just what I wanted ' Perfect  This product was shipped very quickly. I got it in 5 business days!! The seller took such great measures to make sure the necklace was shipped carefully, the packaging showed that. The necklaces are beautiful & shiny. Yes the pendants are small, but I think it's in a good way. My fiance is away at college and I just know this will mean so much to him when I give it to him for his birthday!! I posted my own pictures of the necklaces so everybody can see the actual size!! I am extremely happy with this purchase!! I will rate this item again in a few weeks after we've worn them for awhile. I absolutely recommend this product to eveybody!! <end>  Excellent chains, mizbah and Value  We just recieved these, and the pictures on Amazon due not do these justice. They are alot better in person. the chains are true to length and the Mizbah is really a Fabulous looking piece. Great jewelry set and Great price.My wife and I have had a set of these for over 40 years of Marriage until we were robbed of them some time ago. So these are replacements but no doubt we both believe they are better than the originals. If you get a chance to buy these do so, They are well worth the Money. <end>  Beautiful piece! Better than I was expecting  I have been thinking about buying a piece of jewelry that would be a physical representation of the love between myself and my boyfriend, and this was it. I was nervous that it would be tacky and the gold tone would be poor, but when I pulled the necklaces out of the pouch, I was stunned at their beauty. I can't wait to give it to my boyfriend! <end>  Excellent Condition, Punctual Shipping Time  I found a Mizpah necklace for $50.00, and would have settled for that when I decided to check Amazon.com This buyer sold what was promised and sent it quickly. It looked like it had never been worn. The price was well below fifty and it arrived on time. <end>  Ok but no cigar  I realize you get what you pay for but this looks very cheaply made. The medal is smaller than a quarter when put together, I expected better. <end>  This is the smallest necklace IN THE WORLD  If I could give this zero stars I would. This Necklace was so small, my husband couldn't even read it. Also before I bought this, I didn't know it was Jewish. I am not Jewish, and neither is my husband. The Necklace was smaller than a penny. So you do the math-If a necklace is smaller than a penny,what size is the font?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?I would not get this if I were you. <end>  Could have been better  I definitely like this necklace a lot, but upon recieving it my wife and I quickly realized that it says  "..one from another" rather than "from one another."Could be an easy mistake, but still a little aggrivating.I am sure it was an isolated incident, so that aside I would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone! <end>  Mizpah Metal Necklace  I bought this for my better half and myself, and it looks well made. It was worth the price to see the look on her face,not to mention the hug and kiss! So if you what to be a good guy, buy one! Nice product! <end>  Beautiful  This Necklace Set Is Better Than I Even Imagined - Such A Great GIft. It is beautiful and elegant - I would recommend THis Item To Anyone <end>  First CHRISTmas  I bought this for my girlfriend on our first CHRISTmas together. They are both very durable metal, and they don't have a cheap feel to them at all. I would, without a doubt, recommend this to anyone.However (and it's actually quite funny), even though this is a small item, it shipped to me in a rather large box considering the size of the Mizpah  ). <end>  fantastic more than expected!  I was really excited to see that all the words were very easy to read and both pieces are nice sizes for a man and a woman are proud to wear. Thanks for a quality piece. <end>  I love it!  This is a great product. The photo doesn't do it justice. It's about the size of a penny when put together, and it's beautifully detailed and very shiny. I've worn it almost everyday for a month and it's (the chain/coin) yet to break or change color at all. The necklace itself came in a nice box and jewelry bag, each half of the coin individually wrapped up so as not to scratch.I would definitely recommend this item. I absolutely love mine, and I love the message it send out and what it symbolizes. A great and meaningful gift for a couple that spends a lot of time apart. <end>  Cute & nice  I ordered the necklace and hoped it would arrived as promised and i know some people may have had bad experiences with ordering it but personally It was shipped on time and when i opened it, it came as promised. Everything looked good and the chain it came with is durable so far but i only really just cared about the pendant and it was perfect so im happy with my order! <end>  Love it!  I got this necklace for my husband who is overseas right now. I wasn't sure what to expect with all the reviews. My expectations where low. But once I opened the package ALL my concerns were silenced. This necklace is just as described. The actual pendent IS small and delicate as the pictures show. The writing is very legible but very small. As shown! The chains are very heavy and of good quality (to me). I love this necklace! I am very satisfied. <end>  Love IT!!!  I love it. The verse is perfect for my fiance and I. We are apart a lot. We do not see each other as much as I would like. I worry about him. The verse on the necklaces are perfect. It says a little prayer for the both of us. I am giving my fiance his half for Valentine's Day. <end>  great  I absolutely love this necklace I got it for me and my boyfriend who is a marine that is deployed in Afghanistan. We haven't seen each other in 4 months..its a great reminder of my commitment to him. I know he is going to love whenever he gets his half. ) thanks so much for a great product!! <end>  fantastic  what can i say is only this well worth the money as my husband has one half and i have the other half it couldn't have been a better present for my husband as he loves it. <end>  Awesome gift  My boyfriend got this for me for christmas. With me starting at University we were unsure of how our relationship would fare. He bought this as a reminder that no matter whereever we are, near or far, that we have each other. For us this was a major step towards a serious relationship.This necklace is not intended for 24/7 wear. I was able to wear it for a month before the chain broke but I am hard on necklaces.I would definitely suggest this gift for other couples. My sister and her boyfriend have the same necklaces and they go to schools that are on different ends of the state. The constant reminder helps them when they are missing each other. <end>  Mizpah Medal nice  The quality is very good. Nice weight to the medal. Very attractive. Problem is that the chain is too short. One is longer than the other. I can't wear mine until I find an extension. Would give it 5 stars if the chains were long enough. <end>  Sentimental and classy with a good price  MY boyfriend is in the Army. He was facing a deployment and i was sad, i am very new to this whole military relationship thing. I saw this necklace and loved it so much that i bought him one. hoping he wouldn't think i was weird and that he would se the sentimental value in it. especially since i am not christian. Turns out he bought me the same thing for my christmas present. he was so proud of himself for finding it.in short  This is a beautiful piece that sums up our feelings and it is a beautiful quality for a great price. I am in love and would purchase another one if i found an occasion to do so. <end>  So cute!!!  I just love this chain Is beautiful  ) I can't wait to give it To my boyfriend this Christmas, I really like the way it came wrap it took it less than 24 hrs to arrive because I paid for over night shipment it was absolutely worth it!I recommend this product 100% <end>  Beautiful  This product came fast and they are beautiful. Purchased as a Christmas gift for my fiance and I. We have gotten so many comments collectivly and individually. The only issue issue were the hooks for the clasps and charms. It was an easy fix by going to a jewelry store and purchasing new hoops and switching them out. Despite the minor issue we both love the product! <end>  Great sentiment for the price  I was happy overall with the product. My major disappointment was that the words were difficult to read when the pendant was together, impossible to discern when apart. <end>  Beautiful  I gave this to my long distance boyfriend for our 6 month anniversary. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry that helps keep us feeling a little closer despite the distance between us. The only problem we have had with the item... his piece of the mizpah coin came off the chain when the ring separated. We were able to find it and he used some plyers to close down that ring a little more. So before you present this to someone, you may want to check and make sure that those rings that keep the coins on the chains doesn't have an opening in it. We've both worn ours ever since we got them including showers, etc and neither of us have experienced any tarnishing or anything. So for me, it's been worth the money. <end>  Love it!  Very good quality. Better than I expected. The chains are very durable and very good price compared to other websites. <end>  Very good product!  I bought this for my fiance for our four year anniversary. Since we are away from each other during the school year, as I go away to college, this is something very meaningful for us. I absolutely love it, it's a great product that is well worth the price, and we plan on wearing them for many years to come! <end>   )  i got it for my girlfriend and she loved it. i wear one piece and my gf the other, the metal is a smaller than i thought but its still nice. <end>  great!  I absolutely loved it! It is smidge small, but definetly worth the money! Not tomention the beautiful meaning behind it. <end>  Good  Loved this necklace and my husband does too. However, I was surprised with how cheaply made it felt and with it not being double sided. It's very thin. I was expecting better quality but it is still a really great gift and very affordable. <end>  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!  I bought this for my boyfriend on our 2 year anniversary and it was perfect! We wear it every single day! I am a person who is allergic to all fake metals so I was nervous at first on how this would react with my skin since it has Stainless Steel in it but its AWESOME! Not one break out or anything. My boyfriend has never been one to wear a necklace but he absolutely loved it. He said out of our whole day, me giving him his gift was the most special and that touched me. To see him wear it every day means the world to me! This is truly an AMAZING gift! It is sentimental, beautiful, sweet and you'd never know how much a $30 gift could mean until you bought this. It has so much more meaning behind it then anyone would ever know!THE ABSOLUTE BEST GIFT EVER!!! <end>  Amazing Gify  I got this for my biyfriend this christmas, it arrived 4 days before we were originally told, which was GREAT, and as soon as i opened it i was stunned at its beauty! I thought it was going to be a dull looking gift, and real tiny, but its extremely shiny, and just the right size  )The words are tiny but not too tiny that you cant read them, as long as you know the meaning, thats all that counts! This is a great gift to give during the holidays! I recomend this gift to anyone of all ages! <end>  Love this Mizpah Medal set  This is a nice quality Mizpah coin. We are pleased with the purchase and would buy a similar product in the future, as well as recommend to others. <end>  Very Beautiful  We love this piece, it is very beautiful. It came way before estimated date , they packaged it with care. I would suggest this piece to any military couple, my wife and I are very pleased. <end>  Perfect Gift  My best friend and I have trouble connecting lately. She expressed concern over me not being around a lot, she was semi sad. So I got these to remind her that no matter how much time passed or where ever we were, I would always be there for her. As OES members it holds special meaning for us as well. I love the design, I love the different chain lengths.Also my friend loves shiny things and these fit that perfectly. I was so very happy to find these and thrilled when they came in. They were supposed to be christmas gifts but I just had to give her to her early.(she's leaving for a different country in a couple weeks anyway) Her eyes lit up when she saw hers and I felt all warm and happy that she loved it. All in all these are a perfect gift for yourself and a loved one. I have found no default in them at all. They arrived on time and the packaging was nice. <end>  Great necklace  Only complaint i can think of is it was a tad smaller than i had expected, but regardless, its a nice necklace, my girlfriend loves it. <end>  Lovely  Ordered this necklace on a tight schedule before i leave italy. Arrived super fast (VIA DHL). The necklace itself is beautiful. Comes in a little black box, neatly packaged with a small dust bag. <end>  LOVE!  I just got this in the mail today. They are so shiny, made in the USA, and stamped 925 on the back. Love them and would definitely recommend! &lt;3 <end>  very nice piece of jewelry  I bought this as a Valentine's Day gift to my Boyfriend and I...he was very touched by it, and I was pleasantly pleased with the purchase. Very nice piece of jewelry...the size is just right...we wear them all the time and people are always curious about it. <end>  Wonderful quality!!!!  I bought this as a Christmas gift to give to my boyfriend. It's very nice and more than perfect! <end>  Excelente producto.  SERIEDAD Y PRONTA ENTREGA. 100 POR CIENTO RECOMENDABLE, SALUDOS Y HASTA PR&Oacute;XIMAS COMPRAS. GRACIAS Y UN ABRAZO DESDE JALISCO, M&Eacute;XICO. <end>  Beautiful  I purchased this gift for my boyfriend for valentine's day. He's a police officer and I worry about him all of the time. He loved it and we both wear our pendants. <end>  Wow, this was a very good choice for my girlfriend and I  Me and my girlfriend are in a long distance relationship right now because of school. Her birthday lands near Valentines Day and so I was looking for something that would be beautiful, meaningful, and not break my bank. Remember, I'm a college kid myself. Anyways, this was on sale and from the pictures it looked really good. After doing some research on the meaning of this type of jewelery I was sold and ordered it. It came when I needed it too and was in a very nice package. My only complaint, and this wasn't enough to take a star off, was that I felt it was a little smaller than I had thought, but wearing my half of this for about a week now, the size is fine, and besides, it's the meaning that counts.Anyways, my girlfriend was floored by it. I think she knows what it means to us in these difficult times our relationship is facing. <end>  Beautiful  Arrived on time in nice velvet bag and boxed. Very good quality. We engraved them and now my husband and I wear them while he is deployed so that all we have to do is look down and know where the other half of our heart is....with the other one.  ) <end>  no  I love the words because they're coming from god there are too small an you cannot see it i don't recommend thes <end>  Material is good, it's a little bit smaller than what I expected  Don't get me wrong, the item is great. Just the coin is a liittle bit smaller than what the pictures showed. <end>  Cool  Very good anniversary gift my wife loved it as do I. I would recommend this to anyone interested in getting this as a gift. <end>  Better than Expected  I purchased these for my husband for Valentine's day. Since he has started traveling a lot with his job, I wanted to make sure we shared a reminder of how much we love each other. He wears his wedding ring, but no other jewelry, not even a watch, so I was going to take his charm off the chain and put it on his key ring. When he opened it, I was shocked at his reaction. He loved them!! He immediately put his on and hasn't taken it off since - he even showers in it! They are well made, the perfect size, and the picture really doesn't do them justice. They are gorgeous!! And they came in a day earlier than I expected. <end>
 B000PARWTC  Sterling Silver Oval St. Christopher Medal, 18" ||	  St. Christopher's medal  The medal was SO MUCH smaller than it represented in the photo. I would much rather have had a larger pendant with NO chain, than the tiny pendant and cheap small chain that it came with. I really can't see myself wearing it, sadly. <end>  Too Tiny  I was so excited to buy this for my husband, to replace the one he lost. When it arrived, I discovered that it was WAY too small. It's MAYBE the size of my pinky nail! You can hardly see the words and image on it, unless you tip it to the light just right. I ended up returning it, as there is absolutely no way I would give this to my husband to wear. <end>  St. Christopher Medal  My daughter loves the St. Christopher's medal. I was afraid it would be difficult to find one just the right size but this one fit the bill. With her driving I really thought one was needed. This one is perfect. <end>  silver necklace  good service, but did not say size of item!! sorry I had to return it <end>
 B000PAS3NQ  Necklace - 18" 4 Strand Braided Leather 3.0mm Necklace with Lobster Claw Clasp ||	  Disappointing  Very poorly constructed. The second time I wore this, the metal coil detached from the leather braiding, which promptly began to unravel. <end>  Looks good but poorly made.  The necklace looks great but the end came off as soon as I tried to put it on. Then I noticed the Lobster claw clasp was broke as well. For $2.95 what can you expect? <end>  Awful Item  Cheap awful item. received refund. they told me they would upgrade it and never did <end>
 B000PAS3OK  Pendant - Irish Celtic Weave Design Crucifix Pendant 18" 4 Strand Braided Leather 3.0mm Necklace with Lobster Claw Clasp ||	  celtic weave crucifix  Larger than I expected. Have gotten compliments on it after shining it up. Don't think it's silver though. <end>
 B000PAS4EO  Sterling Silver Malachite Scroll Design Ring by Sajen, Size 9 ||	  nice quality  I think it's a lovely ring. The silver part of the ring is very well done. The stone I received is darker than shown but I am still pleased with the overall look of the ring. <end>
 B000PAS570  22k Gold Overlay Sterling Silver Multi-Gemstone Carved Face Pendant by Sajen ||	  Absolutely STUNNING!  This pendant is sooo much better looking in person than it is in the photo. The colors of the gems just "pop," and the opal is gorgeous. I've gotten so many compliments when I've worn this. I wear this on a 14K yellow gold beaded chain, 24" long. The bail is big enough to accommodate a large-ish chain, so it will work with a lot of different styles (curb, snake, figaro, etc.). <end>
 B000PAS5AC  Sterling Silver Pearl Filigree Design Charm Bracelet by Sajen, 8" ||	  Pretty but fragile  This bracelet is pretty, but you have to be very careful wearing it. The first time I wore it I found 4 charms that had fallen off at various places throughout the day. Who knows how many I really lost. <end>
 B000PAS5C0  Sterling Silver, Garnet and Moonstone Latch Back Earrings by Sajen ||	  Not a Sajen fan but love these  Usually I am not a Sajen fan (just a personal prefernece as I don't like the rhodium finish on the silver) but the combination of the garnet and the moonstone are beautiful The garnet is indeed dark but catches the light nicely. My main problem with them is that the wire is almost too light-weight and when I push it to the side to hook it in the back, I fear over time it will be damaged. <end>  Moonstone Earrings by Sajen  Nice size and design earrings. The garnet stones, however, lack color and luster. Not the usual quality for Sajen. <end>
 B000PAS6CY  Sterling Silver Charoite Heart Pendant by Sajen ||	  Beautiful stone, Beautiful pendant  This pendant is truly one of a kind and accents the charoite stone very nicely. The charoite stone is a little different than what I've been seeing lately with the deep black markings, but still very beautiful. I was afraid upon ordering that it might be heavy (I do not like heavy pendants) but it isn't at all and goes nicely on a light sterling chain. This pendant also goes very well with the Charoite earrings available from Ian & Valerie on Amzon which I ordered as well to hopefully be a nice match (and they are). <end>  PURPLE HEART PENDANT  Another great gift purchased from AMAZON.com. I love their prices and quality of merchandise. This piece is no exception. I've not heard of the stone "charoite", but it is beautiful. I plan to pair it with a black cord or purple chain before gifting. SAJEN is known for quality & unuaual jewelry.I looked "charoite" in my GEMSTONES of the World book and it is a stone that is new on the market. <end>
 B000PAS6FG  Sterling Silver Scroll Design Lapis Ring by Sajen, Size 10 ||	  Nice but not as nice as other Sajen rings  A while ago I got the "Sterling Silver Garnet Ring by Sajen" for one of my friends. That ring is beautiful and very similiar to this one. However when I got this one for one of my other friends, although it is a nice ring, in my opinion it is not as nice as the first one I bought. For one, the scroll design does not go all the way around (I thought it would), and at least on the one I received, the stone and setting is a little malformed (not a nice rectangle).Overall it is still a very nice piece. The recipient of the ring loved it. I would go for the Garnet version first though if you don't already have it. A plus with both these rings is that the back is open so it is adjustable. <end>
 B000PAS9QW  Sterling Silver Loving Family Heart Necklace - Parents and Child ||	  She loved it!  Bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She loves it and wears it most of the time! <end>  Family Pendant  This is a great pendant, the design is wonderful and everyone keeps asking me where i got it. The silver is very shiny and didn't tarnish the least bit since i bought it, i never had to clean it. It's about an inch in length so it's noticeable, i would say it's a good size, perhaps even should've been a tad smaller. I would definitely recommend it. <end>  I love It!!  The pendant is wonderful put on a different chain it sparkles!!!I purchased one 3 years ago and lost it and missed having it so purchased another one. <end>  Silver Pendant  My wife loved this little gift. It looks just like the photos. Not at all disappointed. <end>  Love it!  I am not a big necklace wearer, but I love this necklace and wear it all the time. It's high quality and the perfect size and weight. I receive compliments on it often. I really love that it shows both parents and a child rather than just a mother and child. Makes a perfect gift! <end>  Very Charming....  This is the perfect necklace for a new mother. It is a simple but beautiful and meaningful design. <end>  Wonderful Mother's Day gift  I read the other reviews that stated the pendant is flatter than it appears in the picture and it is, which is fine as it lays very nicely on my wife's neck. It is very nicely crafted and she really loves it. <end>  Wife loved it, highly recommend for Mothers Day or B-day  Had 21 month old bring to mommy for Mother's Day, she loved it. Only thing that could make it better is if pendant had a little more depth to it (which many other reviews had mentioned, so I was prepared for that). All of the imagaes of this pendant on the web make it appear to be more 3-D than it actually is. Overall pick this up as a gift for the wife, you can't go wrong. <end>  Beautiful  This is such a pretty necklace. It was exactly what I wanted and looks great. <end>  great product my grandaughter loved it  I bought the necklace for my grandaughter on the birth of her own daughter. She loved it. <end>  beautiful  beautiful example of my best friend's sweet family. made a perfect gift. would definitely recommend for others to purchase. very nice. <end>  Loving Family Necklace  I purchased for a young couple and their child. The quality of the necklace seems to be good, but the chain is a little shorter than I expected. <end>  Perfect Christmas Gift  This made the perfect Christmas gift for my wife. The charm represents our family as it is now with our daughter and the two of us. She loved the simplicity of the charm and the meaning. She wears it as an everyday piece. It really goes with anything. I found no issue with the size of the piece. It is exactly what I expected. <end>  It's Great  This thing is great. Its not as three deminsional as the photo makes it look, it's a bit flat. It still looks nice and lays right when worn. <end>  Beautiful necklace!  We purchased this as a gift for a new mother. We haven't given it to her yet, but we hope she loves it as much as we do!  ) <end>  Completely Satisfied  Purchased as a baby shower gift for a mother who had just adopted her first child. Presented it as a gift from her new little boy. She was moved beyond words and will treasure it forever. <end>  Beautiful  I think the neckalace is beautiful. It is so smooth and polished. I bought it as a gift for my daughter in law and I hope she loves it as much as I do. <end>  Love it  Very beautiful and came just as described. The only thing I wish is that the chain was a tiny bit longer, but otherwise I love it. <end>  Wonderful!  Such a beautiful necklace for the price. Gave this to my mom for Mother's Day and she LOVED IT! She's worn it every day since I've given it to her. Really made her happy which is all that mattered. <end>  PERFECT for a new mom!  My husband gave this necklace to me when our first child, a son, was two weeks old. That was December 2009 and I still wear it every day. I get SO many compliments on it and I just love that I can wear something on a daily basis that represents our family's love. We are now less than two weeks away from having our second child--another son!--and although I am sad that I will no longer be wearing this pendant, I'm really hoping to receive the "Parents and 2 Children" one soon after delivery!!  ) <end>  Actual Pendant is not as 3-dimensional  The pendant is just as it looks in the picture, except for the 3-D effect. Upon receiving and comparing it with the seller's pic, I realized that the pendant's photo shot is taken at an angle to make it look fuller and more 3-D. Hence, I am quite disappointed due to it's flatness. As for its shine, box chain necklace, and its craftsmanships, it is great - just the way the picture has depicted.Overall, it is a beautiful necklace ... just don't expect it to be as 3-dimensional as the picture has shown. <end>  Loving Family  It is a beautiful pendant! I love it! It is the right size and helps me show off my love for my family! The seller is wonderful and easy to work with. <end>  Wife loves it  This is a beautiful piece. I was excited that I found a piece of jewelry that represents the whole family and not just a mother and child. <end>  beautiful  Great product! It makes a beautiful necklace, and I wear mine everyday. Just a side note...the figurine is flatter than I thought it would be. For some reason I thought it would be more spherical shaped. Still deserving of five stars though! <end>  Family Necklace  Parents and Child  This necklace is super cute. The back of the pendant is flat, which allows it so sit correct. I love how the arms combine to form a heart shape. The pendant is a nice weight and not at all flimsy. I usually toss the chains that come with my necklaces because they are too small and look like they will break quickly. Not this one. It's a nice enough thickness that I think I'll keep it. <end>  Lovely Pendant  I purchased this pendant and chain for our daughter to celebrate the birth of her first child. The pendant is very nice. However, the chain seemed a bit short for the pendant. We simply purchased a longer chain. The pendant is much prettier on the longer chain as it can now be worn over sweaters and be seen by all. I would recommend this product, especially for the price. <end>  The Box Sucks!  The box on this item is insufficient to give as a gift. You will need to purchase a jewlery box for this.The item itself, as many have said is not as 3D. It is rough 1/4 inch wide if you lay it on its back. <end>  needs a longer chain  )  i got this for mothers day, it is very beautiful but for those people who don't like to be choked by their necklace i suggest you invest in a longer chain to go with it. Other than that i have no complaints.  ) <end>  Great pendant!  Bought this as an additional wife gift for xmas. Ended up she liked it best of all the jewelry shes ever gotten! If you are shopping for silver lovers then this is a real winner. <end>  Nice mothers day gift.  Great gift plus a bonus. If you take a look at it in person, not just the picture, you will notice the kid has a butt crack. My wife still loves it but it is a great joke also. <end>  A gift I'm very proud to give!  I had it sent to my home as I will be giving it to my friend as a birthday present. I find it to be very pretty and the chain a good length for the charm. I just don't understand why there is a butt crack on the child form? I thought it was just a reflection picked up when the picture of the charm was taken for advertisement, but there is an actual indentation that looks like crack to me. Nevertheless, it is not noticeable enough for me to not like it. 4 stars due to the crack; 5 stars if it wasn't there. <end>  Great necklace  I bought this necklace over a year ago and since then I have worn it daily and only taken it off a handful of times (yes I sleep and shower in it as well) and it is still beautiful. Every single day my daughter (Melody, age 4) climbs in my lap and holds the pendant and says "Mommy and Daddy and Melody" and often adds in our pets and sometimes her grandparents because she knows the necklace is to represent our family. She loves it so much I've been considering ordering her one to match. This is a well loved piece of jewelry and I've received many comments on it.The chain itself surprised me. I rarely like box chains because I have a small neck and they're often bulky and just not pretty. This one is very thin and shiny and looks beautiful with the pendant. I fully recommend this necklace (and have many times). <end>  Chain was the wrong length  This pendant was very nice, but it came with a 16" chain, instead of the 18" chain that it was supposed to come with. My wife needs an 18" chain so she had to put the pendant on a chain that she already owns. This means that I paid for a 16" chain that she can't even wear. Other than that, she loves the pendant and it seems to be of very good quality. <end>  Favorite necklace  My husband bought me this necklace the week we had our first baby and I won't take it off. It's beautiful and I get so many compliments on it! Would recommend to anyone <end>  Great necklace.  I bought this for my wife as just a stocking stuffer 2 years ago 1 month before my first son was born. She loved it. Not only did she love it but she never takes it off. I know its cheap but its a lovely image with the parents and child, and it has proven durable as can be. The chain it came with has withstood my baby boy hanging onto it now for over 18 months and it is still going strong. Cant say enough good about the quality of this. Thanks for making a great cheap product. <end>  good  My wife loved it. but I didnt like the way it took all the way up to Valatines day to get to my house. I have to say that that was the longest shipped item I have ever gotten on Amazon. they really took it to the last day. if you are looking for a quick gift, this is not it, takes to long to get mailed to you. <end>  Great Gift Idea  I bought this necklace for my sister. She is very sentimental and loved the idea of a family necklace. Great value for the price. <end>  Family Pendant  I got this for my daughter who is expecting her first child. She loved it and it is exactly what I wanted and expected. Definitely would order from them again. <end>  Wife LOVES it.  My wife and I had our first child on July 6, 2011. She LOVES this necklace. She was surprised to see that the chain was a box chain instead of those cheap flimsy chains that come with most pendants. She has hung a ruby birthstone off of it to further personalize the piece. Overall, she loves it. <end>  Amazing Pendant .....Gorgeous Design!!!!  Got this a surprise gift for my wife and our new born baby daughter. She absolutely loved it! As a topper I had a small 1/4 carat diamond placed in the center, by my jeweler and that made it even more perfect. Great quality.....fast ship!! A very unique gift that she will love!!! <end>  Nice pendant, poor box  Nice pendant, great symbol, but poor packaging not suited for a gift.I had to buy another box and put the pendant inside. <end>  i love this charm!!  the chain is way too short. i had to put it on a white gold chain that i already owned because the chain it came with was a more appropriate length for a child. the charm itself is just as pictured. i've had mine for months now. i wear it every day & even shower with it on. it still looks brand new. it represents my son, my fiance and i perfectly. i wanted something that represented us as a unit and a family. he has an illegitimate child from a previous relationship and up until our son came about, things were far too focused on her..it was always a sore subject. it's refreshing to have redefined our family as a whole and have this great charm to symbolize it! i plan to show it to my son and tell him who it is (Noah, mommy, and daddy) as soon as he is old enough to understand it  ) for now, he loves to pull at it anyway, and it's held up just the same. <end>  Perfect grift for new mom  This necklace is a perfect gift for a new mother. It is made well and a good size for a petite new mom. <end>  Not quite what I thought  The picture on the box is two parents, two kids. The picture on here is two parents one child. The actual necklace is two parents one child. All in all my wife digs the necklace. It was from our son to her from xmas so didnt spend a whole lot on it. more symbolic than anything but the piece seems very nice <end>  Got something different  I was try to give this as a gift but when I got it was a different item. It had white paint on it. <end>  Just as described  This was one of those finds that just puts a smile on a loved ones face and it was worth the money <end>  Wife loved it.  Bought this necklace as a Christmas gift for my wife. It looks nice and my wife likes it very much. The clasp is easy to connect together which my wife likes a lot. She is very happy with the necklace and its a good reminder of us together with our Son. Would buy this again and the price was right. <end>  Looks cheap  I bought this item as a gift for my sister. When it came, I was sad to see that it looks much cheaper than I expected. The area on the 'parents' appears to have a white-ish coloration, almost as if they inlaid another material over it so that the child would contrast with the color. The packaging is just awful- cheap and thin. In fact, I had to get another box to put it in before I gave it to her. My sister still decided to return it in hopes of finding another, nicer family necklace. I do not suggest buying this product. <end>  beautiful  got as a gift for my sister, and she loves it. looked great on her and the packaging was perfect. thanks. <end>  great purchase, indeed.  I bought this as a gift for my daughter, she and her husband are expecting their first child. She loved it and I loved it too. I woulddefinately recommend this necklace. The quality was great and the price was affordable. <end>  Stunning!  This was a gift for my oldest daughter and she absolutely loved it! The weight of it is solid, and it's better looking than the picture shows. A gift that I'm sure she'll enjoy for years to come. <end>  Loving Family Parents and Child Necklace  This was exactly what I hoped it would be. Amazing gift. If it was more 3 dimensional, I believe it would be sticking too far out. It is very bright and I love the box chain. For me, the length is perfect. I would DEFINITELY recommend this as a gift.I am baffled that someone would rate this as a 3 because of the BOX. Yes, when you receive it, the necklace and pendant are in little tiny plastic zip-locks inside the box...but how much work is it to take them out of the baggies and place it in the box by itself? Also, I think the box is nice. On the bottom of the box is a certificate you can fill out for the person it is being given. I will post a photo or two. <end>  Nice Necklace  I love the pendant. It looked more 3D in the picture, but it looks just as good in person. I wish the chain was longer. The necklace came a day early, so it has pretty fast shipping. Overall it's a great necklace and I enjoy wearing it. <end>  Very Nice  I bought this for my wife following the birth of our first child. Despite the price, this necklace and charm are very nice. The design of the charm is really pretty. I was worried it would be bulky on her neck but it is slimmer than it appears and sits well against the skin. She cried when she opened it. <end>  BEAUTIFUL.  my boyfriend's sister in expecting her first child with her husband of 4 years. I bought this necklace because I thought it was a BEAUTIFUL symbol of family love. My necklace arrived and I am VERY happy with it! It comes in a very cute box with a little "shpeel" on what the necklace means. I love this necklace and I am very excited to give it to her for Christmas! <end>  Absolutely love it!  My husband & I are expecting our first child, a son, in June. So he got me this necklace for a mother's day gift & I love it! it's light weight, comfortable, shiny. I wanted a family necklace & not just a 'mom' necklace because i feel like I'm a wife AND mother. Amazon really does have it at the lowest price you can find. I checked around before buying with Amazon & I got free shipping & it was here fast. Bought it on Friday & was wearing it by Tuesday. It really is a great gift. <end>  Lovely  I read other reviews before purchasing this for my sister, who is due to give birth to her first child right before Mother's Day. I agree with the other reviewers that the pendant is not as 3-D as the picture would suggest. Realizing this I purchased it anyway and am quite pleased. It is a nice size and is flat on the back so it hangs comfortably. It's worth the price if you're expectations are realistic. <end>  Great gift for a pregnant wife ;)  Gave this pendant to my pregnant wife as a Valentine's gift. She loves it and wears it almost every day! Guaranteed to melt any mother's heart and keep you in good graces longer than any box of chocolates. And she'll never fret about empty calories. ;) <end>  Beautiful Gift for Mom's and Moms-to-be!  My Husband surprised me with this beautiful necklace for Valentine's Day and I absolutely adore it! We just had our first child in September so this was very special. I would highly recommend getting this as a gift to your loved one. She will LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I've received many compliments on it thus far! It's definitely unique and grabs a lot of attention! - Angela P. <end>  brought tears and smiles  This mother and child necklace was a wonderful gift for my sister who just had her first child. She received it on Valentine's Day draped around the rose vase and it brought happy tears to her eyes. I never expected the necklace to be so beautiful and of such good quality for the price. She thanks her husband every day for it.The special meaning of family behind this type of necklace is priceless. <end>  Perfect gift for my wife  I gave this pendant to my wife as a birthday gift in her first birthday after we had our first child. She was so happy and liked the pendant very much.I recommend this pendant as a gift for the special woman in your life  your wife. <end>  my most treasured necklace  i picked this out for my husband to get me for my birthday. when i saw it i was overwhelmed with emotion. i love it. i read all the reviews and i dont understand why anyone would give it less than 5 stars. the one that said it had white inside of it,..well, it is brushed so that there is a contrast with the child. i like it. it is not white but brushed silver which in the right light may look white. the only downside is the clasp is tiny so for anyone with arthritis you may need help. but that doesnt bother me enough to mark it less than 5 stars. <end>  Looks very different in reality  People had already warned me it looked more 3 D in the pictures than in reality. I still gave it a try thinking it could not be that bad, but the difference was actually so big that the necklace did not even look nice when I got it in the mail. I had planned on giving it as a Christmas gift, but could not get myself to give this away with joy so I returned it and gave her something else instead. <end>  Mothers Day Gift  ***Love this necklace***I was given this necklace for mothers day and it is great! The size is big enough to notice but not overpowering. I get a lot of compliments on this necklace. Adding to the other reviews about it not being as round as it appears in the photo that is true. When you first look at the necklace it appears flatter then in the picture. But I like it better that way it lays nicer when wearing it. I would defenitly buy this again, especially when we add to the family. You can't beat the quality and the price. <end>  When You're Ready to Turn a Duo Into a Trio  My wife and I had been planning on starting a family around two years into our marriage. About a year and a half in I could tell she was getting antsy to start. So, taking that hint, I bought her this pendant as a way of telling her I was ready to turn our two into three. It took her completely by surprise and became her favorite Christmas present by far even though it was probably the least expensive one I bought her.Since then she has never taken it off. And yes, as one other reviewer noted, this thing stands up well against the tugs and pulls of little children. We have lots of little nieces and nephews and not one of them has been able to break the chain yet.So husbands  if your wife wants kids and you're ready to signal the green light, this is the way to do it. I promise you'll be in her good graces for months to come. <end>  Love it!!  I received it before the date I was supposed to and it was in perfect condition. I love it! <end>  She loved it!  My wife is pregnant with our first. I ordered it as a valentines day present and she loved it. Wears it everyday. <end>  LOVED IT....  Thank you very much to everyone at Amazon I bought this as a V-Day present for my wife and she loved it Thank you again it was exactally as what was shown in pic..... <end>  Love it  The shape is beautiful, and it's good for wering. I give it to my friends as a birthday gift, but i bought another one, which is loving couples for myself. <end>  I wear it everyday!  I love this necklace. It is a sweet representation of my family andI wear it everyday! In fact I like it so much it has become my go to gift for moms and grandparents. <end>  It arrived in time and was perfect...  Mom, loved her Christmas gift. I thought the chain was thin, but she thought it was fit the charm perfectly. <end>  It worked as thought  I bought this for my wife after she gave birth to our baby daughter (together with a card). After all the pain and stress it was the perfect way to say a humble "Thank you!". After all she had to go through the most to make us a little family. <end>  Classy and beautiful!!!  This is short and easy, this pendant is classy and beautiful at a good price. My wife gets comliments all the time and still thanks me for it all the time. They have different configurations according to your family size so just look at all the Loving Family pendants to see which one is right for you. <end>  falls a little flat  Like other reviewers have said this necklace is much flatter than the picture makes it appear. Had I read the reviews before I purchased this item there would have been no disappointment at all when I opened the box. Since I didn't, initially I was a little deflated. If you aren't expecting a nearly spherical bauble then you are unlikely to be disappointed. This necklace is beautiful. The size is just right and it rests beautifully when it is worn. I get compliments on it everywhere I go. I am pleased with my purchase and would do it again in a moment. <end>  Easy  This item was for a mothers day present and it arrived early and was loved by the person who received it. I would recomend this to anyone. <end>  Loving Family Necklace  This necklace made my wife's mother's day! It is good quality and very elegant looking. She hasn't taken the necklace off in a 3 days  ) Next year, I believe I will be buying the "2 Children" type--we have another baby on the way! <end>  cute necklace. probably would be better on a shorter chain  Very pretty necklace for a great price. Comes in a personalizable box (have area to write "to" and "from") which is a nice, if a bit cheesy, touch. The only negative is that the pendant is a bit on the large side and my wife would have preferred a smaller version. However, a shorter chain might also help since the 18" chain may make it seem bigger since it looks weighed down a bit. Otherwise, nice product. Silver looks to be of high quality and I would recommend it for a Mother's Day or birthday present. <end>  My wife loves it!  I havent actually put my hands on this, but my wife seems to love it! I bought this and sent it to her while I am currently deployed. It really made her feel special and from asking her, it seems nice and durable. She is very happy with it. <end>  Absolutely beautiful. My wife loved it!  This is a beautiful charm. If you or the recipient likes longer necklaces I would suggest also getting an extension chain. My wife uses one when she is wearing a turtleneck. <end>  Beautiful and artistic necklace  I love this necklace! It's the perfect size and it's very artsy looking (compared to other mother necklaces on the market). I think this will be a family tradition as we grow our family. Beautiful! <end>  Pretty, but too small.  Pretty necklace, but I've gone back to my feeling that it's just too hard to pick-out jewlrey over the internet. The pendent is very small - people can't really make out what it is. I still like it because I know what it is - but it's really an internal feel good thing. <end>
 B000PBVCWY  Amazon.com  Jewelry Display Stand Blue Dress  Clothing ||	  Never will do business with them again  Jewelry Display Stand Blue DressI submitted a purchase order for this item last week and after several days received a cancellation stating that the item was "out of stock." When I checked the item it showed in stock. I could never recommend Bella Casa Boutique to anyone nor do future business with them. The $29 item might be worth $20 in shipping but I will never know... <end>
 B000PCZMQK  10k Yellow Gold Smoky Quartz Ring, Size 8 ||	  Lovely design - poor quality control  I purchased this 10k ring in lieu of the 14k with plans to have the stone re-mounted in a more solid ring setting by my jeweler. The setting is actually nice (wish I had purchased the 14k.)The stone is the problem - it is not cut properly. One end of the stone is angled down into the ring which ruins the nice rectangular/oblong look of the ring.Quality control must have had the day off when this ring was made.I also have the matching earrings & necklace which I love (I placed the pendant on a heavier chain) <end>

 B000PDY4UY  Amazon.com  100% Silk Blue Jewelry Pouch &quot;Roll Model&quot; -Fair Trade Gifts  Clothing ||	  Great Gift!  I bought these for my mother and sister and they were a hit. Very pretty, fair trade item, unique gift. Very pleased with this item. <end>
 B000PE4RVE  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Green Genuine Peridot Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  No Problems  Product was shipped and packaged nicely. Enjoyed the newspaper that was used as a shock absorber. Kinda cool to read something from the other side of the US.... <end>  Love it, but it's not 100% silver  So, this ring is really beautiful and I absolutely love it, except it is NOT 100% silver. I am allergic to nickel and therefore have to get silver or gold jewelry. I bought this ring because it was "silver" but low and behold, I got a really bad rash from it which would NOT happen if it were 100% silver. If you are not allergic to nickel, then go for it, its a great ring. If you are, don't plan on making this an everyday wear ring. <end>  Nice ring for the price...  Nice ring for the price. Craftsmanship and weight are better than expected. When I looked closely, I noticed the stone is not set evenly but for this price I'm not going to make a fuss. <end>  Lovely ring  I purchased matching rings for myself & my daughter. They were shipped promptly, are well-crafted and look very nice. <end>  THIS is NOT STERLING SILVER!  I bought this ring because I am allergic to other metals, but sterling silver I can wear. IT TURNED MY FINGER GREEN! STERLING SILVER DOES NOT DO THIS! THIS IS NOT STERLING SILVER! <end>  Elegant and simple  This ring design is simple and yet elegant...I wear it with everything. The size of the stone isn't overwhelming and the setting is smooth and low enough to not catch on clothing, etc <end>  Bargain  This is a nice little ring for the money. It is very dainty, smaller than I expected,but very pretty. I think it is a good buy. <end>  Very Pretty!  The peridot stone isn't as bright green as pictured, but it's a genuine stone, so the hue can vary. Otherwise, I am very pleased with this ring, the stone is well set and it goes well with my other celtic knot rings. <end>  Beautiful  Very good quality for the price. Stamped .925 which means it's genuine sterling silver. The stone sparkles quite a bit, even in artificial light. I recommend removing if washing hands with harsh soap or else risk damaging the finish. Sterling silver does sometimes tarnish, but that is easily fixed with a little bit of silver polish. <end>  Pretty, but...  I received this ring from my friend as a Christmas gift. It's very nice, and it looks as pictured, but after a few months of daily wear the stone fell out never to be found again. I've never had this happen to me with a ring before. <end>  Adorable  I must admit that I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this ring, being that it was so reasonably priced, but it's lovely. It's dainty, but not flimsy. The stone is nice and for the price, this is a great ring. I got the peridot, but I'm going to get another color as well. <end>  Sparkly!!  Love this ring. The cut of stone is nice and sparkles even with little light. Awesome!!! <end>  Very Pretty Ring  A beautiful ring! My girlfriend is so pleased with this piece of jewelry. It is her birthstone and has become her favorite ring; she wears it daily. The one time she took it off and misplaced it she nearly cried. It looks so good on her. The ring design is wonderful, the stone is beautiful, and the price was right. <end>  Nice!  Ring was a little smaller than I expected but still very attractive! I'm a huge peridot fan so I'm very happy with ring. <end>  Gift for Girlfriend  This was a Gift for my girlfriend she's been wearing it daily for about 8 months now, it's still in new condition and hasen't had any problems. <end>  beautiful ring  The ring is very well crafted, beautifully detailed, the stone is very clear and lovely. It is a solid little ring, and I would recommend it. <end>  CELTIC KNOT RING  BOUGHT THIS RING FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE RING.THE RING WAS EXCELLENT FOR PRICE AND WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN. MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT! <end>  Pretty design, weak metal  This ring looks great but is not the best quality. Metal loses it's shape after wearing and is easily damaged. <end>  A Present for Hayden  I didn't actually see the ring, but my granddaughter loves it. Will order again from this vendor. <end>  Nice Christmas for my Sister  I got this ring for my Sister for Christmas. She loves it and I was happy with that and the price good buy. But I do hope it doesnt tarnish like people were saying about the Sapphire one of this ring  S <end>  Celtic Peridot Birthstone Ring  I am very happy with my purchase...the picture that advertises the product is exactly what you get.Very nice people to do business with. Will definately buy from them again. <end>  I love it  This ring I purchased is simple and petite and cute. Not bulky just enough to say celtic (which Grandmother Hines was Irish)and to share my birthstone. I have no complaints. I have been wearing for it for 2 weeks and tell my friends about my new purchase. <end>  This made a young girl very happy  I bought this for my granddaughter, and was afraid that it would turn out to be little better than costume jewelry, especially at the price.The ring came packed professionally, and is of good quality and appears to be a more expensive item than it really is. I am happy with the purchase, and so is my granddaughter. <end>  Nice ring  The only reason this is getting 4 instead of 5 stars is because the coloring of the stone is a little yellow, but clear and lovely all the same. The setting is nice and there are no snags. I've already been complimented on this ring a few times. <end>  silver ring  This ring is stunning and my daughter cried when she got it because she has never found a ring big enough to fit and this came in a size that fit her perfect <end>  Great buy!  This ring is just lovely. It's well made, a nice sized stone and cute design. And all for so little money... it's a great deal. I've been wearing it for a week and the only green on my finger is the peridot stone! I would recommend this ring to anyone. <end>  Sister Gifts 4  This is my birthstone. I've always wanted a birthstone ring, but I've never found one simple and attractive enough to suit me. Now I have. I liked it so much, I gave one to each of my sisters with their own birthstones. <end>  Fantastic Ring!!  I love this ring!! Can't beat the price and quality and it is VERY comfortable on the finger. Not sure what's up with the person saying it turned her finger green - that doesn't make sense. The ring looks much more expensive than it is - don't be afraid to buy it as a gift. <end>  Okay, wouldn't buy this again  This ring turned my finger green, and when it comes to jewelry, that's not exactly what i prefer. Cute, but seems to be very cheaply made. Sorry... <end>  love these rings!  I got this for my sister. Peridot is her birthstone and we are Irish! She loved it and has had it for over a year now and it is still in GREAT condition. No tarnishing or marks are on you finger. <end>  Beautiful  love the ring, the color of the stone,the cut of the stone, sterling silver celtic knot, It's so pretty  ) <end>  Beautiful Ring!  This ring is absolutely beautiful, the picture doesn't do it justice! I love purchasing from Silver Insanity, they always have quality products. I'm very happy with my purchase. <end>
 B000PE8C0Q  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Blue Sapphire Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  Love it  Have received so many compliments. It looks beautiful. Extremely glad I purchased it. Been wanting a sapphire ring or a long time <end>  Blue me away!  There were a lot of reviews saying that this ring looks cheap. Quite the opposite! For the price, let's keep in mind this cost less than $30, I found the quality very acceptable. If I had paid a hundred dollars I am sure I would have a different perspective but that being said all things being equal this is a very nice ring. I love the Celtic knots and the setting. I always have hated prongs so this is a great alternative. It does mean less light so the stone apprears a little darker but it's cut so it still catches the light and has a nice sparkel. I bought this to match earings that I bought my daughter that have the same setting and they go perfectly together. It's a nice size too. The band is a little on the thin side but not terribly so. I wouldn't have thought about it if other's hadn't pointed it out. My daughter is 11 so I didn't think an expensive ring was appropriate but I didn't want something that looks cheap.. This is perfect because it has the look of a 'real jewelry store ring' (my daughter's words) but at a price that I don't have to worry if it get's lost or damaged. If you want a tasteful, pretty ring that isn't tacky or looks like costume jewelry than this is a good choice. <end>  Great ring!  I bought one of these for my sister and she loved it. Then for my birthday my boyfriend got me the same one but with my birthstone (saphire). Thank goodness I had gotten it for my sister because I thought I lost it so I bought this one as a replacement! I ended up finding the first one and now I have two, still in great condition. They don't leave marks on your fingers and have not tarnished one bit. <end>  Nice Deal  My wife was very pleased with this ring,looked like it was worth more than it cost. Everyone had nothing but nice things to say about the ring. <end>  i love him  my boyfriend got me this ring as a promise ring and i swear i couldnt be happier its absulutly beautiful i suggest it as a promise ring i truely do lol im wearing it right now but trust me if you think it looks nice on here ladies wait till its on your fingure i nearly attacked him with a hug and a big kiss God i love that man boys you might want to look into this <end>  Beautiful inexpensive ring!  I absolutely love how translucent the sapphire is in this brilliantly-created ring! And I'm a huge fan of celtic design, so this was exactly what I was looking for! <end>  Nice Ring  Nice medium-weight ring with a decent sized Sapphire. The stone is a lighter color blue, but is attractive. Excellent buy at these prices. <end>  For the price  I ordered this ring one day and two days later received it in the mail. Small package but very secure, so the shipping was great(standard shipping). The ring itself feels really well made, it has a good weight to it and, though i haven't tried yet, i feel it could take some abuse without showing it. It looks good and from even decently close up, it will look real to non-proffesionals. Its a good ring and for the price, i def recommend it. <end>  Superb Company!  I love this ring! It is exactly what I expected and what is shown. I think the stone may be just a little darker than in the picture. What's really awesome is this company!! Due to gift card problems which I will not go into, I believe my amazon.com account had been reset when they were fixing my problem. Well i was so excited to order these two rings I'd been eying I didn't even notice until AFTER the order went through that my shipping address had reset! Worst is my old address is California and I am now in Tennessee! I emailed both sellers right away and this seller helped make sure I got my ring! They had to ship it twice and did not even charge me the second shipping! It's some of the BEST customer service I have ever experienced and I will be doing business with them again!! Thank you Thank you to the good people at Silver Insanity! You guys are awesome!!  ) <end>  great ring!  This product was sent to me in a timely manner and its a great product. The color of the stone is beautiful. <end>  Nice ring great price  My wife loves the ring. She picked it out. I actually purchased 2 of these with different stones. The quality is comparable to similar looking rings in the $100 range. Good choice for a teen/young adult on a budget to get for his girlfriend.The ring is kinda on the thick side giving a somewhat less dainty or feminine look to it and it has a bit of a dull/unpolished look. If you take it to a jeweler you should be able to get a shine buffed into it; but hey you can't complain for less than $20 and if she likes it that's all that really matters  ) <end>  Silver Ring  Excellent Purchase. Really good quality ring and it arrived in a very short amount of time. <end>  Excellent  The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The band is strong and doesn't seem like it will break easily. The stone is just as advertised. The celtic knots are detailed. This ring makes a wonderful gift. <end>  Beautiful Celtic ring  I'm very pleased with my ring. It ran true to size and has a delicate look I love. It came in a nice velvet pouch suitable for gift giving. Nice value. <end>  good  the ring is beautiful. got it within 3 days. the only thing is the stone is a little darker than in the photo of it, but its still beautiful. i wear it everyday and it has not tarnished at all. would definitely buy from seller again! <end>  beautiful ring  I love this ring. It's true that the stone is a little darker than anticipated, but other than that, it's flawless. I have read others reviews on how these rings turn your finger green, but I have brought three rings from silver insanity and that has never happened to me. I would strongly recommend this line. <end>  very nice ring  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Blue Sapphire Ring (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)I love this ring. It's pretty, well made and extremely comfortable. <end>  Lovely, especially for the price  This really is a lovely little ring, particularly given the very low price. I only wear sterling, white gold or platinum - this ring fits in nicely with my others. Sizing was also dead-on, which is always important, particularly when purchasing online. I'll be looking to the seller for future jewelry needs. <end>  Nice Little Ring.  I like the ring. It was quite inexpensive and the size is small, but it is nice looking. <end>  nice ring  The ring was just as pictured. I ordered the wrong size, but it was exchanged in a timely manner. Would order again. <end>  Sparkle-ier then it looks  So much prettier then the picture. The sapphire is clear and glittery. Love love this ring, will definately buy again from silver insanity. <end>  warning about price  This same exact ring is sold at many other websites for $19.98 USA dollars please be warned. I wonder if they buy the rings at those sites and resell them here for more? <end>  For the price  I love this ring, but I have one complaint.. I didnt have it on for 2 hours and it turned my finger black! But for the price I cant really complain. <end>  stone too dark, looks cheap  Got this ring as a gift, the stone looks much darker than the picture(almost black) and the setting looks a bit costume jewelryish. <end>  You get what you pay for  This was a very pretty ring, the only this was after only a few weeks it began to tarnish. <end>  Love it!!  I love this ring! It's very well crafted, with a beautiful royal blue stone. The color is just what it looks like in the picture. Very nice ring. <end>  Reasonable price  I purchased the ring for my little girls 6th Birthday. She loves sapphires, but at her age didn't want to get an expensive ring. The ring was perfect, stone was clear and reasonably priced. <end>  Great product  This was a great ring for a great price. It is beautiful and my daughter was delighted to receive it. The price was excellent and the shipping was fast and efficient. I would buy from this company again. <end>  Sister Gifts 3  This is a birthstone gift for the oldest of my three sisters. I got one for each of them in her own birthstone. It is an attractive, simple ring and I thought they would be able to wear them every day. <end>  love it  just love it! the quilty is very good and it is very durbale (sorry for the spelling) <end>  Worth More than Cost  Fun jewelry - holding up well over time, definatly worth the small cost of the product. <end>  blue sapphire celtic sterling silver ring  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Blue Sapphire Ring (Size 4,5,10,11,12,13,14,15)I was very pleased at the fast delivery. The Sapphire stone is stunning, I would not think it was real with out them stating that it was, its so pretty. The price is fantastic! <end>  awesome deal  This is a very shiny silver ring! The stone is a nice dark color and is large! It really looks great in the sun, Looks way better in person than pics. Thanks for the deal! <end>  GORGEOUS!!!  The ring arrived with the matching earrings, which I loved. This ring is absolutely gorgeous. The price was right and it was shipped very quickly. I haven't taken it off since I got it! It's beautiful. I would definitely recommend it if you are into celtic sapphire jewelry, and I would recommend the company that shipped it, silver insanity. Love, love, LOVE it! <end>  celtic sapphire ring  This is one of the nicest basic pices of jewelry I own! Simple, basic and very pretty. I've received lots of flattering comments on it. I wear it when I wear blue, which is often! <end>  Ring is excellent, very pretty!  I gave it to my girlfriend as a gift, and she loves it! It may tarnish slightly, however. I recommend painting it with clear nail polish.You get what you pay for, I suppose. All in all, a great gift however. <end>  Beautiful  My mother bought me this ring for my birthday. It arrived a little earlier than expected (which is always a plus in my book)and it was prettier than I imagined. The stone was a deep blue and the silver sparkles, the fit is fantastic. I definitely plan on buying the amethyst one very soon and would recommend it to a friend in a heartbeat. <end>  Girlfriend loved it  I should have reviewed this a long time ago. I admit when i got this 2 years ago it would have been bigger but it was small and my girlfriend loved it and how pretty it was. Worth the buy in a sweet romantic kind of vibe. <end>  Daughter loved this ring for Christmas  It is an excellent ring and I would recommend it. It has a very nice triquatra on each side and it you are into the symbols it can mean a great many for different people, and religions. My daughter has a necklace also witht the triquatra so she is loving the ring lol... <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Know and Genuine Blue Sapphire Ring  I really love it. It's very comfortable and stylish. The stone is dark but when the light shines on it , it looks like the night sky. Its a good every day ring. <end>  Completely In Love  I am SO happy with this ring. The blue of the stone is quite lovely [medium-dark blue] and the proportions are fantastic. I have very large fingers [my ring finger is a size 11] but unlike many rings, my finger doesn't dwarf it. The Celtic design is just right as an accent to the pretty stone but not overpowering. The ring is designed well and its easy to wear, which I appreciate greatly, after a few cutting into my finger.Mine was given as a semi-temporary engagement ring and I'm 100% happy. Its pretty, a great price, and extremely comfortable. <end>  CELTIC RING  THE ORDER WAS RECEIVED FAST. THE RING IS JUST BEAUTIFUL. IWOULD RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO BUY THIS RING. EVERYONE I HAVE SHOWED IT TO LOVES IT. <end>  looks and appeal  Can't really say much of the item from a girl's point of view. I bought this for my girlfriend, not sure if she'd like it. All i can say is that the ring pretty much catches attention. Love the blue stone! <end>  First Ring  I originally bought this ring for my niece when she turned 12 and she wore it everyday. It held up beautifully during all the normal rough and tumble play for the last 4 years. I'm buying her a new one only because she lost it while swimming and is heartbroken. I highly recommend this as a first ring. <end>  Great ring  I have had this ring for 4 years now, and i've worn it almost every single day of that time, and it still looks amazing! I love this ring and its totally worth the money. <end>  Nice, non-flashy ring!  I really like this ring! It is simple and understated and I believe the picture is a good representation of how it looks. The stone in my ring is almost the exact color in the picture and in low light it appears just a bit darker. I have had this ring for nearly a year and have worn it every day - I have had no problems with flaking or non-removable tarnish of any sort as mentioned by another reviewer. In fact, I like it better with a little bit of darkness on the inner part of the designs at the side of the stone because it makes the Celtic design stand out more. But it cleans up easily and has stayed nice and shiny so far. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this style of jewelry! I am thinking of purchasing the matching earrings. <end>  Awesome ring  This is a beautiful ring! I couldn't be happier with it. It fits perfectly and looks like it would be much more expensive. It is also very comfortable to wear, and doesn't have any prongs to catch on clothes. The silver is shiny, and the stone is a beautiful shade of blue. <end>  nice ring  I bought two of these sapphire rings for my twins granddaughters for Christmas and they just love them. It is hard finding a size 4 so I was really pleased that they fit perfect. This ring is really pretty and not to too flashy. <end>  quality and style  I purchased the ring and matching earrings and am very pleased with the quality of the stones and the workmanship, highly recommend. <end>  Heavy, yet delicate  I bought this as a gift to my daughter. It looks just like the picture. It is delicate, but surprisingly heavy and well-made. The gem is a pretty colored oval and a nice size. It looks good on my fairly large hands. I definitely recommend it. <end>  Deciving  The image of the ring on line is much prettier than what you actually receive! The quality in person looks cheap. <end>  Very nice for the money!!!!!!  Don't hesitate to buy this ring. The sapphire I received is a lovely deep blue that the light shines through to flash cobalt sparks. I have a large finger. This looks good on my hand and is comfortable. The design is lovely and the quality is very nice. Definitely worth the money. <end>  Silver and Sapphire... what a nice combination!  This is a nice little ring. Very shiny silver, polished to perfection with no porosity, make this perfect celtic design on the shoulders to frame a real faceted sapphire stone, wich to me has the perfect color. Very comfortable to wear and a pleasure to look at. <end>  sterling silver Celtic knot and blue sapphire ring  I am wearing this ring all the time. It's pretty. It arrived quickly. I'm pleased with the service. <end>  I LOVE IT!!!!  I LOVE THE RING!!I look at ever time i wear it. You cam wear it with anything you put on. get the ring. Its a nice size and the stone is beautiful. <end>  not good  I ordered the ring in a size that was suppost to fit. The ring was to small so I went to send it back. It took a week to get in touch with anyone. Then I sent it back. I e-mailed silver insanity for 2 weeks with no responce. Their customer service is terrible. They dont get back to you in a timely manner or even just a friendly e-mail to let me know what is going on. I was very unsatisfied with them and will not purchase anything from them ever again. <end>  My new favorite ring  I bought the ring b/c my birthstone is Sapphire and I'm Scots/Irish. By far it is such a good quality ring for the price. The stone is perfect, the silver is thick and good quality and lovely celtic design. <end>  Nice Ring  I liked it, a little small but I was able to get it stretched and the guy at the store stated he didn't think it was a real stone. I made him check and sure enough it was  ) thanks <end>  Great quality ring for reasonable price!!  I bought this ring as a present for my 14 yr old daughter and it was a hit!! All her friends wanted to know where she got it at because they want one! Beautiful sapphire stone catches the light and the silver accents the stone perfectly!! Wonderful quality. My daughter has recieved many compliments on this ring. Great gift idea for that "hard to buy for" female!!! <end>  Sapphire Ring  Could not be happier with the product arrived in great shape. Most my wife loved it. Thank you very much. <end>  I love it.  I couldn't believe it was the same ring. It was better than I expected. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Blus Sapphire ring  I just love this ring! And the fact that it comes in a wide range of sizes is a big plus to me. Thank you so much! <end>  Saphire ring  Recieved item quickly, it was pakaged very nicely, and looked very similar to what it did online. It's beautiful, I love it! <end>  Gorgeous!  I love this ring! Quick shipping and beautiful stone for the money! Looks like i paid much more! <end>  Oh so pretty  I've wanted a sapphire ring for many years and I've loved this particular style celtic design in a ring for years but never saw it in a sapphire before. I'm so glad to finally have that gorgeous shade of blue in my ring collection. When I opened the package, I was delighted with the beautiful blue hue that was exactly what I had wanted wear so I need to have it cut down to fit better and then I'll use it a great deal more. With all sincerity I can say that I am pleased with this purchase. Very pleased! <end>  Lovely ring, great service  I ordered this Celtic knot ring with a sapphire. It was beautiful, the price was incredible and the service was super-fast.I strongly recommend this product and seller! <end>  she loved it!  I bought this ring for my daughters 21st birthday and she has not taken it off yet. It's only been two weeks but I am very impressed with the quality. Nice solid silver, the stone is a very dark blue. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Blue Sapphire Ring  I've never had to do a review like this from Amazon before - weird.Anyway, the Celtic Blue Sapphire Ring was disappointing in that the stone was not entirely raised from the setting, making it look flat when you look at it from above. Too expensive for its quality (and I doubt it's a real sapphire). Also, size 7, my usual size, was too big. <end>  pretty blue ring  This ring was everything I hoped for. Lovely color and no flaws in the silver design. I have several colors of this ring that i got for half the price. This is definitely a higher quality metal. <end>  Celtic ring.  I got this ring as a Christmas present for my daughter; she liked it. The ring ran true to size, and the worksmanship, while not of craftsman quality, was acceptable. It was a good buy. <end>  I love this ring  I received this ring a while back, and I have to say, "I love it!" Although I do agree with other reviews who said the ad was misleading by stating "Genuine Blue Sapphire" when it is a lab created sapphire. The ring is still beautiful, sparkly, a beautiful colour, and the silver is bright and gleaming. It is an excellent value for the price, and a beautiful work of art. I am well pleased with the product. <end>  Pretty deep blue  3.5 stars, but definitely not 4 stars. I have never been a person into celtic designs but really like this piece. I wear this ring twice a week. I agree with one reviewer that it can look like costume jewelry, but we get what we pay for since it is a lab grown stone. The name "genuine blue sapphire ring" is very deceiving and I was almost tempted to give 2 stars for this reason alone. Real sapphire can cost up to hundreds and thousands of dollars so I am still happy with this find. <end>  Runs a little big  This ring is very pretty and of good quality for an inexpensive ring. However, it does seem to run a little big . . . I'm probably going to have to get a ring guard. <end>  So pretty!  I love celtic jewelry, so what attracted me to this ring was the celtic knot designs on the sides. In addition, blue is my favorite color, so the sapphire stone sealed the deal for me! I was very pleased when the ring arrived. It was packaged well and it's such a pretty, feminine little ring. I have been complimented on it several times! Again, the celtic design is so lovely and simple. I wear the ring almost everyday and it has held up very well. I'm very pleased and would purchase again from this seller. Love the ring! <end>  beautiful ring!  I really do love this ring. I wear it every day! One comment on here (by someone with "boss" in their username?) said that theirs wasn't as dark as the pic showed. Mine was almost exactly the same color, and I'm very happy with it.I don't know if it's something with the acidity of my skin or the quality of the jewelry I have, but my jewelry always turns my skin green... and, unfortunately, this ring was no exception until I put a coat of clear nail polish on the silver part of it. I believe another review said that it DIDN'T change their skin color, so maybe it IS just me.My favorite colors are sapphire blue and silver, and I absolutely love the Trinity symbol of the ring, so this really is a gorgeous ring to me.Update  About 5 months later, the bottom of the ring started wearing thin - the metal is thinning out. I don't dare wear it anymore except for special occasions, and that makes me sad. I loved the ring! <end>  my thoughts  I bought this ring as an impulse buy and was glad I did. It is beautiful and well made.It came in the mail quicker than I thought it would. Today I ordered the blue topaz for my daughter. This is a great choice for your buck. <end>  beautiful product  beautiful ring. It was just the right size and color. I recieved my shipment in a speedy fashion, I would recommend this item and provider to friends. <end>  Right style, right size  This was a birthday present for my daughter, and I am just so happy with it. She has large hands and we were unable to find any ring in a store that would fit her. But she really likes rings, so I looked on Amazon. She loved it! It fit great and the style is so pretty. <end>  Very pretty  I have had some less than satisfactory experiences recently buying offline but I was very satisfied with this ring. It is shiny and the stone is very pretty. Someone wrote a review that the stone was light blue but it is not. The stone is a dark blue, just as it is pictured. I wear this ring often. <end>  Nice!  The ring I received has a dark blue stone, which I like. The setting is well-made, and it's comfortable to wear. It is substantial, yet suitable for someone with small hands. <end>  Pretty nice item  The sapphire is a lot paler than what the picture shows. In fact it looks more like glass than I would have liked. But the price and fit was right, and I wasn't expecting it to look like a $1,000 ring, so overall I was satisfied. <end>  great ring!  the ring is beautiful, reasonably priced and delivered so fast. love it. will order again from this vendor! <end>  great ring  I love this ring! I went on to buy another one with a different stone, I liked the setting so well. <end>  Beautiful!  I really, really like this ring! I received it as a promise ring from my boyfriend for Valentine's day (to be replaced when I finish my degree.) The only potentially negative thing would be that the stone is so dark it almost looks black sometimes, but I don't mind. I actually like the darker color. I am planning on getting the matching pieces sometime soon! <end>  ring  My wife liked it a lot.It looks like it should cost a lot more very nice.Thank You Wayne <end>  Nice Ring  Fast shipping. The silver was polished to a nice shine, but the stone was a little darker than I would have expected (even darker than the picture). It's more of a midnight blue/almost black in most lights. Not sure if the stone is really genuine or not. One of these days I'll get around to taking it somewhere and having it checked out. Assuming it checks out though, this is a beautiful ring. <end>  Better than what the other reviews would lead you to believe  I was looking at this for a Christmas present for my girlfriend, and, reading the other reviews, I was worried about how the ring would be. Others were complaining that the ring tarnished easily, that it left green marks on their fingers, or that the stone was darker in reality than in the picture.This hasn't happened. My girlfriend's been wearing the ring everyday for the past two weeks, and it has neither tarnished nor left any residue behind. The stone can look black, but only when the light strikes it in a certain way. Otherwise, I would say the stone and the ring look exactly like they do in the picture.It even came in a nice velvet pouch  no wrapping required. Highly recommended! <end>  free range or cultivated.. who cares?  I got this as a Christmas present and it's beautiful. The stone is a deep dark blue and I cannot see any difference between it and other sapphires I own that were much more expensive. So, if it's a lab grown stone it makes no nevermind to me. I love it. <end>  Celtic Knot ring  Anyone who loves Celtic jewelry will enjoy this ring. The genuine blue sapphire lured me toward it over some equally well mastered Celtic rings without stones. <end>  An excellent ring  I got this ring to replace my engagement ring (my son was born in September, so sapphire is his birthstone). I am extremely pleased with this ring. The picture is accurate (the color in particular!), and it is sized correctly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who was looking for a simple, pretty sapphire ring! <end>  Great Ring And Service  This ring was exactly as pictured and shipped promptly. It was a present my son gave his girlfriend and the quality is wonderful. Thanks for a great product and speedy shipping of this ring. <end>  classy and beautiful  This ring is the perfect size. I love the celtic knot design. The sapphire is a beautiful shade of royal blue. I can count on your company for quality. Have ordered from you before and will again <end>  pretty, but description is deceptive  I love this ring, it is very pretty. The extended sizes are outstanding. If it is in fact a genuine sapphire for this price it can only be a lab grown stone. This is not bad, as it will test the same chemically and optically as a natural stone but is worth far less. Some shoppers may be mislead by the claim of "Genuine Blue Sapphire". <end>  Perfect Little Ring  I put this ring on my Wish List because I wanted a simple sapphire ring. The price is unbelievable and the Celtic design was a bonus. My husband gifted it to me this year and, boy, was I happy. Not only is it pretty it's a perfect fit. The balance is nice as the stone doesn't fall the the side as I type or get in the way. Most days I forget that I have it on it's so comfortable. I would recommend this little ring for anyone who wants something simple that will go with most anything, anywhere. <end>  Beautiful  I thought I had left this review, but I guess I had forgotten it. I bought this for my gf. The silver hasn't tarnished one bit. She has had it since last year some time I believe. She loves it. ***** Recommended! <end>  Great Value  This ring is even more beautiful than the photo can show--the sapphire sparkles like a diamond, but with less ice and more soul. When I wear it, people comment on how lovely it is. The ring is beautifully crafted; I would have expected to pay much more for this (forgive the pun) little gem. <end>  Saphire Celtic Knot Ring  I really love my Celtic Knot Ring. It has a lovely Saphire as my birthstone, and the band is gorgeous silver with a Celtic Knot design. It came on time, and in a lovely gift bag. Thank you Amazon. Everyone who sees it loves it. <end>  celtic sapphire ring  The ring is good enough quality. I thought the stone would be alittle lighter in color. It looks almost black instead of blue most of the time. I don't really think the stone is a genuine sapphire. But for the price the ring is very nice. I've had the ring now for a few weeks and I've worn it almost everyday. I would purchase jewelry from this company again.Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Blue Sapphire Ring (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) <end>  Sapphire Ring  I ordered two of these for my girls, one sapphire and one amethyst. Although they are smaller and more delicate than the picture shows, they are well made and attractive. The sapphire stone was very dark and looked black unless turned just right under bright lights-then you could see that it was a dark blue. (The amethyst was really lovely if you are interested.) Good selection of sizes, fast shipping. <end>  Great Value!  I agree with most of the other reviewers--this is a great ring. It's pretty and well made--it does not look cheap at all. The ring is a nice size--it's substantial, but not ostentatious--neither too big nor too small. And what a fantastic price! It's hard to go wrong with this one. <end>  Thought it was good......at first  I purchased this ring because I have one in Garnet that I like very much. This is advertised as being Genuine Sapphire. It is not which is not really that big of a deal because it's just as pretty. What makes this a 3 for me is that it's also advertised as being Sterling Silver. It is not. After about 3 days of wearing it, the "silver" was badly tarnished and wouldn't come clean even when I polished it. Then the next day I noticed that the inside and edges of the band were turning black which also wouldn't come off. Then the very next day the silver came off completely on the inside and outside of the band part. Now I know a lot of people think that if something isn't real silver or real gold it will turn your skin green. That is not the case. I work at a Jeweler and it's things that you are eating or medicine you are taking that makes the reaction with you skin and turns you green. Even 24k gold can turn you green or brown if your eating or taking a medicine that reacts to it. I never had that problem with this ring. It never turned me green. But when I tested it it isn't real silver. I don't mind and I still think it's very pretty ring. I just dont like to be misled. And even if it wasn't real, it shouldn't have flaked off so easily. Overall I like this ring very much but I doubt I will buy anything from "Silver Insanity" again <end>  Lab grown stone  This is a nice ring, but the explanation is very deceptive. This is a lab-grown stone, not a "genuine blue sapphire" as the title claims. Also, the stone is not dark blue as the picture shows, but more of a light-medium blue. If you don't mind this stone being lab-grown this is a very nice ring. <end>  Real sapphire?  I am disappointed by the stone in this ring. It's very dull and looks black most of the time, even in sunlight. It might be that the cut is keeping all the stone deep in the silver, not allowing much light into the stone. <end>  Beautiful, but tarnished quickly  I've had the ring for about 2 months now. It is beautiful, the blue sapphire is very pretty & I get lots of compliments on it. The only downside is that it began to tarnish within 2 weeks of being shipped to me. <end>  Extremely Pleased  I took a chance on ordering jewelry that I had not seen in person, and I am very happy that I did. I bought two rings from this jewelry line and both turned out excellent. The size fit my finger perfectly and the stone is a beautiful dark blue that catches the light well. I would not hesitate to buy from this jewelry line again. <end>  Sapphire Ring  I just love the sterling silver sapphire ring. The celtic knots on the side make it extra special The delivery was incredibly quick. And best of all, the price was right. <end>  Outstanding product  I am very pleased with the product and would purchase again from this company without hesitation. <end>  My new favorite ring!  I waited a month and a half to post this review to make sure the quality of my ring upheld. It has! In my experiences with this product, the silver did NOT tarnish or turn your finger green (and I have fairly sensitive skin) as stated in another review. The stone is a perfect deep blue that sparkles nicely in the sun. The silver band does NOT easily warp or bend or scratch with daily wear (and I've worn this ring non-stop since I got it). I get many comments on how beautiful the ring is.I bought this ring under the impression that for the cheap price of it even if it was a lab grown stone, or even if it wasn't the exact correct color or the silver tarnished or bent easily that I was simply getting what I was paying for. But this ring has surprised me and is now my favorite ring! It's a great product. Give it a try but if you experience the problems that others have had, remember how little you paid for it. <end>  very pretty  By the way it looks in the picture i thought it would look a little cheap, but when i received the ring i realized it looks so elegant, the sterling silver looks very polished and shiny, and the sapphire does look blue and shines a lot, it was a gift for my mom and she loves it, the only thing is that the ring size chart is a little bit misleading, my mom ordered a ring size 10, after we printed the chart and used it, but it's too big for her, in the picture it looks like the ring is adjustable, but its not, i fixed it with a tool so she can wear the ring now, but overall Amazon.com was very fast in sending me the ring and also the ring looks very elegant and shiny. <end>  Nice ring  The ring is very pretty and my friend was extremely happy to receive it. I was pleased at the speed in which it arrived. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Blue Sapphire Ring Size 11 (Size 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 15) Review  I had gotten the wrong size for this ring at a size 11 and I never returned it to get a smaller size to my mistake. But I like the ring. <end>  Sterling silver blue sapphire ring  Absolutely beautiful ring!!It is akk I expected and more. i would recimmend this seller to everyone! <end>  Blue Ring  Love the ring, wish I would have known that it came in different colors though. <end>  Blue Sapphire Ring has to be worn only in Middle finder - Excellent ring at low price  Blue Sapphire is awesome for the price, Ring has to be worn only in Middle finder.This stone (Blue sapphire) as great gem....As per the old literature of Indian Vedic astrology (the oldest and genuine form of astrolgy).....it is highly powerfull stone and can term to be Auspicious as well as In-Auspicious....this depend on how good the Saturn is for your chart as per vedic astrology.Since most of them of are un-aware of vedic astrolgy science....I would recomend you to BUY it, BUT if you find any un-usual happening after wearing this ring then....it is likely that this stone is either of inferior quality or Saturn is not good for your chart as per vedic astrology. In that case you should aviod wearing it.Note - this gem has to be worn only in Middle finder and It can be highly in-auspicious if worn in other fingers (Saturn is highly conservative strongest of Inaspecious planet....anything againt it is can prove worst for you). Preferably try to wear this ring on Saturday or Friday or Wednesday (Saturday is best).....as blue sapphire is a gem stone of Saturn as per vedic astrology.Hope you belive the vedic science...rest is upto u to decide. <end>  horrible  i am very disappointed. my girl had the ring not even 4 hours out of the box and it began to tarnish and turn her finger green. i will say anything but bad things about this company <end>
 B000PE9AIO  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Blue Topaz Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11) ||	  Fabulous!  These rings are wonderful! They fit beautifully and look terrific. They don't feel too heavy or overpower your finger. I have this style in 3 stone colors and love them all! Wish I could have them in every stone color! Priced right and a 'steal' for the quality. <end>  great ring  The craftsmanship on this ring is great,nice detail and not to big. My girlfriend likes it very much. <end>  I LOVE this ring!!!  This is one of my favorite ever rings!!!  ) It is sooo pretty and makes my hands look more feminine (chunky rings don't work, unfortunately, on my hands very well). It is my beautiful birth stone, the ring is well made and of good quality. I absolutely LOVE this ring!!! <end>  Such A Lovely Little Ring  This is a very nice ring, it's pretty, it isn't too overbearing, and it will make a great Valentine's Day gift. It didn't take any time at all to get here, and I got exactly what I wanted. I will certainly look for more items to buy from Silver Insanity. <end>  Great quality for a great price.  This ring was surprisingly beautiful and very well constructed, especially when you consider it was only [...] bucks. The sterling silver is very pretty and is very high quality. No green skin or anything like that. Beautiful blue topaz! <end>  Beautiful and tough  I bought this ring for myself a little over a year ago because it has my birthstone in it. I must say that it is an amazing little thing. Though it is showing the tiniest bit of wear it has held up well. I work in the food industry and put my jewlery (and clothing) through a lot.It is just as beautiful as they show it in the pictures. Every time I wear it I get compliments. Definitely worth buying 5/5 <end>  Perfect!  After reading the reviews I had to give this ring a chance, and I am so glad I did! Others have said it is dainty and feminine and I agree, it is not bold or too large, and that makes it perfect for me. It is not too tiny either, I think it is the perfect size if you like something classy and beautiful. I will probably order another in amethyst! <end>  Nice purchase  This is a very nice ring, rather for girls. The stone is very bright and beautiful, and it settles on hand as it should. The quality of the silver is good, very well polished and the knot done well. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Ring  Excellent response when I found that the ring was too small. Silver Insanity promptly sent the next larger size, which fit, and a mailer to return the smaller ring. Product was as advertised. <end>  Great Product  My girlfriend thought it was great. Good cheap gift to make someone feel special. <end>  BEAUTIFUL!  I was satisfied that this was a pretty ring when I saw the photo - but on arrival I was stunned! It looks MUCH more beautiful and expensive than the photo can convey. The quality is much better than I expected for only $15.99. I love it! <end>  Celtic ring review  Bought one for each of my teen aged daughters. Very pleased by the simple beauty of these rings. <end>  Hard to find a blue topaz  I am love the ring. It is a gift and I'm well pleased with the product. Seller is easy to do business with. <end>  cute and princess-ey  It's lightweight and sweet. Could be for a young person as well. It's sweet and the stone is a light color. Fast delivery. I think it's very feminine and worth the price. <end>  Not as blue as shown  It is a pretty ring but I was disappointed with the color, it is not as blue as shown in the picture <end>  Beautiful ring  I really liked this ringProswonderful pricesuper shiny stoneConsA bit smaller than I expectedPretty light weightI would recommnd this ring to people who would like a nice looking without having to worry too much about losing it. <end>  perfect for my daugter  This is a simple, yet beautiful ring. Very dainty & perfect for my young daughter. Looks beautiful on her hand. <end>  So in love!!!  I love this ring. It is light and made beautifuly. I would buy it again. It did not take long for me to get it and they had it in my size. The stone is just the right size for me. <end>  Lovely ring  This is a very pretty ring. Not as hefty as it appears in the photo; it is more delicate, and very smooth. I love it and would highly recommend it. <end>  Poor customer service  Shipped quickly the wrong ring. Wanted me to pay for return shipping on their mistake. Took almost a month to get proper ring shipped to me. I gave an extra star for the ring as it is a very nice ring. Procede with caution on purchasing. If you get the problem I got, get Amazon involved quicker than I did. It wasn't until I contacted Amazon, rather than company directly that I got results. <end>  Beautiful and dainty  I love this ring! The color is beautiful and the workmanship is spectular.Its very dainty looking. Love it! <end>  Awesome details and gorgeous stone  This is a beautiful ring and exqusitely detailed. You really have to see it in person to appreciate it. The ring is beautiful. <end>  unsatisfied  I purchased this ring and was very disapointed. I had it less than 24 hours before it turned my finger green. This is a sign of poor quality. I have been wearing sterling silver for over 25 years and have only had this happen with cheap costume jewlery. I wont be purchasing any more from this company. <end>  Beautiful  The ring came in a timely matter and was absolutely beautiful but the stone fell out 2 or 3 weeks after i got it. the setting isnt really secure. <end>  celtic knot fan  I bought this ring for my pointer finger and it is absolutely beautiful! I love this ring and feel naked when I take it off to do the dishes or shower! The stone is such a beautiful shade of blue and sparkles so brightly in the sun! Love it, love it, just love it! <end>  Disappointed  I ordered this ring after purchasing the Amazon Amber Celtic Love Knot ring and loving it and I have to say I am pretty disappointed. It is not nearly as nice, the stone is too flat in the ring, and it turned my finger green within a few hours of wear. Sterling silver isn't supposed to do that. I don't think I will be purchasing any more items from this seller. <end>  Just Right ...  If you're tired of the big, clunky rings in fashion right now, this classic style will be perfect. I have long, thin fingers and this ring is very simple and elegant. Size runs a little on the large side, so keep that in mind. The stone is a light blue and the polished silver setting really sets it off nicely.A wonderful value. <end>  Pale blue  This ring is very pretty. The blue is very pale, as in the picture. <end>

 B000PEA4NO  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver Adjustable Hearts Toe Ring ||	  Two hearts,too cute.  This ring is too cute. It's adjustable so it can be worn on any finger or as a toe ring. I'm actually wearing it on my thumb. It looks just like the picture representing it. I also ordered one for my daughter so we have a matching set. The hearts are small and makes it look so dainty. I love wearing sterling silver, so it fit right in with the rings I already had. Thank you so much. I would recommend it to anyone of any age. Thanks again! <end>
 B000PEDU3K  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver Fancy Design Filligree Adjustable Toe Ring QR1938 ||	  toe ring  The toe ring was bigger than your normal toe rings. But it was very nice. <end>  Nice but...  this ring is nice and fancy with the design it have, but because of that design, while my wife was adjusting it, broke in half the first time, soo theres no much to say about this. <end>  love it  I love this company, the quality and prices. The jewelry comes in a cute little bag. I have ordered this companies toe rings by the bunch and gave them to girlfriends for a summer gift. love em' <end>
 B000PEE23W  Pretty CZ Bow Sterling Silver Anklet ||	  Pretty and dainty and subtle  I loved this ankle bracelet! Unlike other ones, I barely would notice when it was there and it didn't rub against me and irritate my skin. After about 6 months though, it broke =( <end>
 B000PEFY3O  White Freshwater Pearls Necklace - Clearance Final Sale ||	  Perfect bridal necklace  This necklace is absolutely gorgeous. It is the absolute perfect length and such great quality. I can't wait to wear it on my big day. Such a nice compliment to my wedding gown. <end>

 B000PEKOVQ  14K Yellow Gold Round St Jude Pendant Medal ||	  smaller than expected  Beautiful piece and high quality, but it was smaller than expected. With gold at the price it is right now the pendant should have been priced lower for the size. <end>
 B000PEKP3S  14K Yellow Gold Round St Gerard Pendant Medal ||	  Nice pendant but the chain is not gold  I bought this item for my wife thinking that the pendant and chain was gold. It turns out that the chain is not real gold. <end>
 B000PEM42S  Sterling Silver Oval Shaped Locket ||	  Just ok...  The locket has a very nice appearance and there is a inner plastic cover that holds the photo in nicely. The negative is the very little use of silver in this locket, there is absolutely no heft to this, it almost feels like it is made out of foil. Opening the locket is very difficult and it felt like it would just break because it had to be pried on so much to open. Being somewhat handy I was able to adjust the latch to a more reasonable level. <end>
 B000PEMBYO  14k Yellow Gold 10mm Green Jade Stud Earrings ||	  Nice  Earrings are very simetrical and the gemstone quality is good. Overall very satisfied with the purchase. Very nice earrings. <end>
 B000PEO7Z0  14k White Gold Moissanite 3 Stone Lucern Past-Present and Future (2.00 cttw equivalent), Size 5 ||	  Exquisite  This ring is astounding and you will not be disappointed with this piece. I received my ring yesterday and am very thrilled with the quality and craftmanship of the piece. I took this ring to the mall to compare it with their overpriced pieces and I am so excited about the deal that I was able to get on this ring. It is gorgeous and I saved a lot of money. All of the jewelers were in disbelief by the price that I paid, question the authenticity of it and were very snooty when I shared the price with them. I have to say that I am very happy that I have this ring, and have wanted it for a long time. The smaller carat weights cost more than this one, so if you can afford to get it, grab it and wear it like a queen. <end>

 B000PGNV7I  Emperor Penguin Pin from the Artazia Collection #702 NP OP ||	  attractive, but disappointing construction  I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift, but am debating whether or not to give it to her. The item is colorful, but the front is rough, the pin's construction does not seem very sturdy, and the backing is just glued on. All in all, I think it might be worth 15 dollars at most, much less than what it cost. <end>
 B000PGX0RY  Back To Basics Pendant with Metal Shade Finish  Black ||	  inexpensive but good  I used it to replace a bubble lamp in my rental house. It probably gives off more light and looks just as contemporary. <end>
 B000PGY3JI  Sterling Silver .925 Tanzanite cz stone 5mm round circle stud Earrings ||	  Beautiful blue color  I bought these thinking it would look good in my cartilge piercing, but they're bigger than I was expecting but well worth the price. Plus they're a very pretty blue <end>
 B000PH3H6C  Earspiral tm 301XSMN, Niobium ||	  Niobium, the perfect earrings for sensitive ears!  After so many "hypoallergenic" and even "stainless steel" earrings have caused itching and irritation for my daughter's and my own ears, I bought these. They came as promised and when I tried them they were light and comfy and didn't irritate my ears or my daughter's! Wish I could get several other pairs! What a fun metal, with the colors that don't come off, and the graceful shapes that Harry Mason designs. <end>  love them  loved them. Very pretty. got allot of comments on them. I would get them again, getting them for a gift for my sister, she will love them. <end>
 B000PHDLUO  Ladies White Gold Diamond & Sapphire Circle of Life Pendant Chain ||	  I would give this 0 stars if I could.  This is hands down the WORST purchase I have made on Amazon. I know, I know, you get what you pay for. Yet, I failed to see any mention of the fact that the sapphires would have visible chips, pits and cracks in them (one of the chips covers almost half of the sapphire). This was going to be a gift, but it's such a terrible piece that I can't imagine giving it to anyone. If you are thinking of buying this - save your money. <end>
 B000PKJYNO  Monte Carlo Mother of Pearl Silver Tone Dragonfly Necklace ||	  very pretty  Well made, beautiful, unique necklace. Picture doesn't do it justice. I didn't rate it a 5 because the dragonfly often slides down to the end of the chain. <end>
 B000PKJZ6K  1928 Bridal Classic Simulated Pearl Stud Earrings ||	  bad earring backs  The earrings themselves are quite pretty, but the backs are VERY loose (one fell off on my morning walk to work without me even touching it!). I have already lost both backs, so I am going to have to buy replacements in order to actually be able to wear these anymore. <end>
 B000PKJZ8S  1928 Jewelry Black Diamonds Crystal Petite Teardrop Earrings ||	  Cute but....  These are really cute earrings but have too many flaws and not enough good things. First off let me say the backs are longer than the earrings... and second while they are dainty and adorable they are very poorly made and I don't foresee them lasting more than one wear. Save your money and spend them on something more substantial in quality...Bottom Line  You couldn't pay me to recommend these to a friend. <end>
 B000PKLYQE  Bridal Crystal Fancy Drop Earrings ||	  Wedding  These earrings are elegant and beautiful and match so perfectly with the y necklace available from 1928. They were part of my bridal set and truly were perfect for creating the Audrey Hepburn look I was going for on my wedding day. The metal in the picture looks almost black to me and this is not the case in person, although the metal does look darker... it's more of a vintage or antique look and very pretty. <end>  Crystal Earrings  These were purchased for my daughter to wear on her wedding day. They looked beautiful on her! <end>  Beautiful!  The picture of these earrings don't do them justice. We bought them for my daughters wedding and they are pretty and old fashioned looking. Just what she wanted! <end>  They are beautiful and I looked amazing on my wedding day!  They are beautiful and I looked amazing on my wedding day! Thanks so much! <end>  Bridal earrings  Very happy! Great sparkle and detail on the front and back. Looks spectacular with the matching necklace. <end>  Wife loves it!  Bought this to match with the the bridal necklace from the same brand (see my review under the same title). The set is my wife's favorite now. And she looks beautiful wearing it.Very happy with my choice!  ) <end>  Beautiful Stylling but...  I really like the styling of these earrings, and they're well made, but they weren't very shiny or sparkly. I don't think they're worth the price. I returned them. <end>  Very Cheap Looking.. Hate it!!  If I've seen real pictures I wouldn't have bought it, it is made of a very light material and really isn't worth the money. VERY pricy for how it looks, it looks really cheap, maybe $2 max. I really regret buying it and will give it to a child! <end>  Awesome  These earrings along with their matching necklace are stunning. They look so real and can make any bride stand out  ) <end>  Wedding!  I will be wearing these for my weddin. very cute and the style I was looking for! Only complaint... feels like really light &#34;silver plated&#34; material and doesny shine. Does well in pics though  ) <end>  very pretty  These earrings are amazing!!! they look much more expensive than their price. very fancy-looking, I will be wearing them for my wedding, Absolutely love them!! <end>  too dressy for everyday earrings  I bought these to wear to a wedding. For the price these are a great deal but a little too dressy for everyday earrings! So, I wouldn't recommend these. They aren't very comfortable. <end>  Definitely worth it  I bought these to wear on my wedding day. They're perfect and match my dress and I even bought the matching bracelet! I love them both and they were both worth the money  ) thank you! <end>  Perfect!  I know there were some other reviews that mentioned how small the drop was on these, so I was a little worried to order them. I'm glad I went ahead and did, though, because I personally didn't feel like they were too small at all. I bought the matching necklace to go along with these and will be wearing them for my wedding next month. They're gorgeous! <end>  Beautiful!  I purchased these earings and the matching necklace for my wedding last year. They are more beautiful in person! Highly recommend!!!!!! <end>  Pretty but too small  I thought these earrings were bigger. They are pretty but I'm not going to wear them for my wedding as planned. <end>  Beautiful earrings  These earrings are beautiful for the price. The diamonds above the crystal drop are smaller than the picture indicates, but still doable. I bought these for my wedding and look wonderful with my dress. I am very happy with these earrings! <end>  the Cherry on Top  This was the perfect accessory for my dress, I absolutely love the way it brings something beautiful and classic to a modern day look without seeming too themed. Honestly there is a lot these earrings(and matching necklace) can be worn with and the level of detail in their intricacy and the romantic design take a wardrobe selection from pretty to awe-striking! <end>  Great set.  I bought both the necklace and the earrings and they are so awesome!They look so fabulous on my daughter and accented her dress perfect.This set is so beautiful. Everyone made great comments on the set. Well worth it. <end>  Beautiful  We bought these for my daughters wedding. They looked so natalgic on her. It completed the outfit. So classy!  D <end>
 B000PKLZ3G  1928 Jewelry Bright Brass Green Floral Organza Necklace ||	  Great Quality  For the price, I think this piece is the best you can get. 1928 is a good company with fast delivery time, and this particular piece is even more beautiful and unique than it looks in the picture. Overall, a fantastic buy. The organza/chain twinning was especially pretty. <end>  The green organza necklace...  Stunning. Especially beautiful with a white shirt and jeans. Love it. Received it as a gift - I love 1928's jewelry. <end>  NIce Costume Jewelry  This necklace is larger than I thought it would be. It is very pretty and looks very much like the picture. Although it is pretty it is very plasticy. It is great for costume jewelry, but it is definitely not the type of jewelry to be worn all the time. <end>  Made a wonderful gift  I ordered this necklace as a Christmas present for my niece. It came quickly, nicely packaged, and she loved it.... and the earrings I got her from 1928 Jewelrey too. <end>  Very cute!  Fun necklace, but just thought the "jewels" could look less plastic. Thanks overall though! <end>
 B000PKNEOY  1928 Jewelry Jet and Silver Tone Faceted Bead Stretch Bracelet ||	  Cute and reasonably priced  Nice product for the price.It is a simple, but elegant vintage style bracelet. I gave it to my bridesmaids to wear in my wedding. <end>  Better than I expected!  It's so pretty and the bracelet is stretchy but it's not super big, so it won't slide of smaller hands. The beautiful design allows me to wear it in a more formal work environment, and I can still wear it when I'm dressed out for more fashionable events as well. It's a very well rounded bracelet. Can be worn in any type or style of fashion! You can rock it out just about anywhere!BTW, There are some really nice "1928" fashion earrings in all black that would go great with this. 1 pair of chandelier earrings and a pair of drop downs. There may even be a necklace. The 1928 Jewelry line seems to make matching sets of their jewelry1928 Jewelry Moroccan Black Diamond Earrings1928 Jewelry Elegant Black Drop Earrings <end>  Beautiful Bracelet!  This is a very nice bracelet. It looks much better than the picture shows it. I was very pleased. <end>  Not Enough Contrast  Despite the fact that the jet faceted beads are nice and the bracelet is well made, the silver tone beads are antiqued and not as bright as I would have liked. If you like that antique look you will like this bracelet. <end>
 B000PKNEQM  Jet & Siam Hues Crescent Chandelier Earrings ||	  I bought this pair of earrings because they match my bracelet  I am not fully satisfied with them because they are not as long as how they looked in the image, unlike with a pair I bought elsewhere which were only $6 more expensive but were looking really great, of good quality and flattering to my round face. However, even if I could return this pair of red dangling chandelier earrings, I did not do so because they match my bracelet anyhow and the purchase is satisfactorily fair enough. <end>
 B000PKNFMU  1928 Jewelry Noir Black Crystal Hues Mini Chandelier Earrings ||	  Very nice for the cost.  These look great for the cost. Understand that the "jewels" are plastic as you might expect. However, they look great and the detail is better than I had expected. I bought these and a few other pair like them for my wife for Christmas. She was very pleased as she can wear these with dress up or down. I believe she told me this brand is also available in one of the department stores like Macy's, Sears, or Penny's if you happen to be at the mall. Price was on par with costume jewelry in the store. <end>  They are "Mini"  These are very pretty, but I have to agree with another review, they are too small, if they were just a little larger they would have been perfect. Also, don't expect them to come in a nice box or package. The plastic wrap they came in was dirty and looked like it had been sitting around for a very long time.Update on this review  I have worn these earrings a few times and it isn't too long when they really begin to hurt my ears. Took them off a few minutes ago and my ears were bleeding and aching. They obviously have a metal that is irritating or that I am allergic to, so to those who have allergies to certain metals please beware! <end>  Christmas Gift  My young grand daughter loves dangling earrings, but most are too big for her. These were the perfect size. Not only did my grand daughter love them, so did her mom. <end>  Perfect  These were the perfect size and the perfect price. Great for you or for a gift! I recommend to all. <end>  Perfect  These are very beautiful earrings. The size is perfect. I have short hair and wearing really big earrings looks silly. These are the perfect size. You can wear them with EVERYTHING and they are just dressy enough. I love the versatility! <end>  Pretty, small and dainty  I wanted something small to match a black beaded necklace. This is nothing fancy about these earrings, but small enough from a distance they look quite elegant. <end>  GRRREEAATTT BUY!!  )  I was nervous about buying earrings onine and only seeing pics... but these earrings are beautifull and good quality!! I wear these all the time they are not overwhelming,very delicate and nice!! I love them!! wish they were in more colors!! Great Buy!! <end>  would have been perfect  I bought these for my wedding (my dress has black on it) and they would have been perfect except they are too small. I was hoping they were bigger. Other than that, they are great. I would keep them but they arent my style for everyday or dressy. <end>
 B000PNV01K  Clearly Charming Double Red Hearts Italian Charm Bracelet Link ||	  A charming piece!  Even though I had to have some help assembling the charm bracelet this piece went onto, it's a delightful little piece that enhanced the personal message I placed onto the bracelet! <end>
 B000PO1LW2  Clearly Charming Army Mom Italian Charm Bracelet Link ||	  Highly Satisfied  I bought this as a gift for my mom. The quality of the link was great and it has held up well. I have had experience with some links "breaking" in one way or another. This one has held up well. I recommend it. <end>
 B000PP4NO4  SCER171 Sterling Silver Pink Butterfly Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  very cute!  I purchased these earrings for my eight year old daughter for Christmas. She loves them. They are just the right size. <end>  Very Pleased  I ordered these for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She wanted a dangling pair of earrings. These are perfect for her. They are just the right size and they are not too mature. They are beautifully made and the price for them was just right.She will love these and I'm sure she will want to wear them all the time. I will definitely buy from this vendor again. <end>  Eh, what can I say...  I don't know what they mean by Swarovski Elements...they are little pink butterflies. They look like they could come from any gumball machine! The only reason I'm not returning them is they are for my 4 year old niece, and they will probably be lost or broken pretty quickly and it won't be a big deal at all! I was expecting something at least a tiny bit sparkly, but they are not one bit! <end>  Cute For A Young Girl!  Bought these for my 8yr old niece. They were smaller than I thought they would be but very cute. I think they're perfect for little girls. Not too grown but not too babyish either. <end>  Cute earrings...  I purchased these earings for my 9-year-old step-daughter. These are really sweet and very well-made. She loves them! <end>  So cute!  Got these as a birthday gift for my 10 year old niece. She is in love with pink and butterflies so it was a perfect gift. She loves them! <end>  Disappointed  When i saw these earrings i immediately fell in love with them. I thought they were really pretty for my 11 year old neice in law especially because she loves pink and butterflies. But when i opened the box they were TINY!! I mean really tiny!! I was expecting them to be at least average size. I would recommend these for maybe a little girl between 7 or 8, <end>  Mariah Loves her new Earrings!  This was a birthday present for our granddaughter who confided in me that her little brother lost all of her earrings! I ordered these the day before her birthday on a Sunday and received them that Tuesday following a holiday. She said they are her absolute favorite and she wears them all the time. They don't hurt her ears and she just Loves them! <end>  smaller than I thought  They are very littler...different than I thought. But the crystal is clear and beautiful. Only problem they are really small it's hard for people to notice them if you have long haid... <end>  She loves them  Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. She wears them everyday. They look great and have held up to several weeks of constant wear. What I like is the the dangle is not so long that it gets in the way, but allows her to feel grown up. <end>  Perfect Gift for my niece (8 year)  It is a perfect gift for little ladies. My niece loves it. I recommend. My niece will be a great fashion model, and this product make she more beautiful. I love my niece, she is smart, inteligent and beautiful (i think that i say it again).   ) <end>  very cute  I got these earing for my daughter who is 4. They are adorable. My only complaint is that in the picture they look more flashyk/sparkling then they actually are. <end>  Perfect for Granddaughter Age 7  I purchased these for my 7 year old granddaughter who wanted big earrings. I didn't want to invest in gold (for fear of loss) nor did I want to purchase hoops (for fear of injury). She loved them! the price was just right; if she loses them it doesn't break my budget and she feels like a big girl. <end>  Perfect for a little girl  Bought these for my 3 year old daughter. She loves them. I was afraid the posts may be too long, but she has not complained so they must be ok. She's been wearing them ever since. Her baby sister loves to stare at the crystals catching the sun light. Very cute. <end>  pink butterfly swarovski earrings  The earrings are very pretty, and tasteful. They dangle a little bit, but not too much for a young girl. My daughter loved them!! <end>  VERY PRETTY!  I ordered these pink butterfly earrings for my granddaughter and I know she will love them. <end>  Beautiful!  I oredered these for my 8 year old daughter and I suspect she will absolutely love them! They really are gorgeous. She's going to look fabulous in them! <end>  Satisfied!  I bought two sets- one in pink and one in lavender. I really liked how they look and I hope the little girls I bought them for will love them.Thank you!! <end>  kids swarovski earrings  The pink kids swarovski earrings were smaller than i anticipated, but just the right size for my 3 year old daughter. They are so pretty, and shes gotten tons of compliments on her little earrings. She even loves them. <end>  Great Earrings for Girls!  I bought these for my 10-year old niece and she loved them. They're very cute and not too grown up like some earrings for children. Excellent quality. <end>  Very Little  They was very little and should not be got for an adult they are almost to small for a child. But they are cute. <end>  Very delicate and pretty  I bought these for my 8 year old daughter. They are the perfect size and very pretty. I dont love the safety in the back which makes taking them off a bit of a chore. Otherwise they are fantastic. <end>  it is tiny!!!!!  It does not like the picture, it's size is very very very very very small and the color is not the same as the photo~disappointed&#65281;&#65281; <end>  much better than the picture  I wasn't certain if my daughter would like these. When they arrived they looked much better than the picture. I know she'll love them. They are a brighter pink color than the picture. <end>  Adorable earrings!  Bought for my 7 year old niece who loves sparkle. These earrings are very pretty, they don't have a ton of sparkle bc they are not very faceted but pretty for a 7 year old for sure! The box was very cheap, the sides are &#34;bent&#34; in almost dented but not damaged. Not great considering it's a gift and I know my niece won't even notice. Overall I'm pleased and look forward to giving her these cute earrings for Christmas 2012! <end>  Cute Earrings  I bought these earrings for my daughter's 5th birthday, when I received them in the mail they were smaller than I was expecting and the color was a little lighter then I was expecting. Although they were not what I expected them to be, they are very cute and look great on my daughter. She loves them and I am glad I bought them for her birthday and I plan on purchasing the other colors they have for my daughter for Christmas. <end>  cute  My little girl loved them and they are delicate enough to keep in for long periods. They only got 4 stars because one of the posts was badly bent and it was difficult to get it back to a reasonable shape without jewelers pliers. other than that they were just the ticket. <end>  Too Small  Well I bought these for my 4 yr old niece, but since it was too small did not gift it to her, the screws are too small n very easy to lose, the screw thread is also not well made. But overall they are cute. <end>  Love these  I bought these for my 6 year old daughter and she loves them!! She hasn't taken them off since they arrived. They are very good quality and have caused no problems for her ears at all. <end>  Swarovski Earrings at an amazing Price!  I purchased 2 pair of these earrings because I couldn't believe the price. When they arrived, I was even more surpised to see how beautiful they actually are. I am extremely pleased. Thank you. <end>  Great Gift for 7yr old!  I got these for my daughter as an encouraging gift for doing well at school. She loves them and wears them constantly. The price was great and delivery was prompt with good feedback from the seller. <end>  Perfect for a 6 year old.  Bought these for my 6 year old daughter who wears her earrings 24/7. I was constantly buying new earrings because they would fall out and get lost. These have been the best so far - they have a little nitch on the post so the backing stays in place, not to mention they are a perfect size for a little girl and cute as can be. <end>  Charming & pretty  I gave these to my granddaughter for her 7th birthday. They're a little longer dangles than I wanted for her but they look so sweet & sparkle. She loves pink, butterflies and anything that sparkles and shines so they were a big hit. I think I might buy her the lavender ones as well. I know she will love them! Great price and look more expensive, good overall value. <end>  Swarovski Butterfly Earrings-pink  Who can go wrong with Swarovski Crystal? These earrings are absolutely beautiful but significantly smaller than they looked on the page. I ordered them for my Maid of Honor, in both Lavender and Pink and they are stunning but very small and delicate. Regardless of the size, I know that she will love them. The studs on these earrings are great for sensitive skin; just as described on the page. I am a health care professional and got these earrings because of the sterling silver studs and the pair I wear have yet to bother me and almost all earrings bother me.Great choice for any occasion. <end>  Great for a little girl  I purchased these for my 6 year old daughter. She is very petite even for a 6 year old so I was worried they would be too big. They are not, they are absolutely adorable and perfectly appropriate for her. As other's have said, I do not think they would be as fitting on an adult. Note these are also my daughter's first pair after the starter pair (ones her ears were pierced with) and there has not been any problems due to the materials, weight, etc. <end>  My Daughter loves them!!!!  I bought these earrings for my daughter as a keepsake gift from me. When she opend the box on Christmas it was pure delight! They were beautiful, packaged well, and everything a young lady could dream of! I will always make sure to keep my eyes open for other products from this seller, as I couldn't be happier with this purchase! <end>  Beautiful  The earrings were a Christmas present for my daughter. She loved them and i was very please at how nicely the crystal was cut. Beautiful for casual or dress. <end>  Gorgeous  The earrings are perfect for a little girl. It doesn't sparkle like i had hoped but it is still very beautiful. I would recommend these earrings for any little girl. My daughter is 4 and it looks perfect...not too big or small. It also has a safety closing in the back so you won't lose them. <end>  Cute for Little Girls! Beautiful!  Very cute and attractive pink butterfly earrings! My 8 year old niece received as a Christmas present and absolutely loved them. She just recently got her ears pierced and is very excited about wearing earrings. She has been wearing these everyday since Christmas. The earrings are adorable and are a perfect size for her little ear. This was an excellent purchase! <end>  Beautiful for little girls!  These pink earrings also come in purple. They are both very pretty for little girls. Not sure I would buy them for an adult. <end>  Pretty in Pink  These earrings are pretty little butterflies, with the operative word being little. They are allot smaller than I thought they would be. I gave them to my granddaughter as they were to small for me. <end>
 B000PQJBJ0  Sterling Silver .925 Simulated Tanzanite Stone Round Circle 4mm Small Stud Earrings ||	  Not sterling silver!  Got these for my wife who has very sensitive skin. She is allergic to most metals. These earrings made her ears so bad she can't wear any earrings now until her ears heal. These are not sterling silver!! <end>  Just perfect.  These are so dainty and beautiful. Perfect for sensitive ears. I purchased these for my daughter's 4th birthday. They are inexpensive and are great for teaching your daughters responsibility, how to take care of their beautiful little things. <end>
 B000PQX8KI  Clearly Charming Bee Italian Charm Bracelet Link ||	  Really nice bee charm  This is a very high quality Italian charm bracelet charm. Great for any fan of bees -- or honey (and who isn't)? <end>
 B000PR22WC  Clearly Charming Brown Horse Head Italian Charm Bracelet Link ||	  Great  Charm looks exactly as advertised and fits as promised on a starter Italian charm bracelet. Very cute for the horse lover! <end>  Charming charm  I purchased this charming charm for my granddaughter. She is so pleased. This is a nice item. Reasonably priced andreasonable shipping. <end>
 B000PR52R4  18K Rose Gold over Sterling Silver Champagne CZ 4mm Round Stud Earrings ||	  Romantic, warm and uniquely beautiful  These are lovely, and go well with my other rose gold jewelry. The Champagne CZ's are gorgeous, a genuine champagne color and NOT orange; the rose gold vermeil is definitely pretty in pink; this pair is inexpensive enough that someone considering rose gold or champagne diamonds should go ahead and purchase these. Great for a gift as well, you'll love them! I do. <end>  Don't like the rose gold  Will probablly try again for another one but don't want to take the time, effort to return t hese. Don't care for the rose gold - looks like of cheap. <end>  Beautiful earrings  These earrings are beautiful. A great value for the money. I wear them all the time. I got them quickly. <end>  Very pretty for the price.  A very nice looking delicate post. Perfect for everyday.I would have preferred if they were offered in 14 carat gold, but probably would cost a lot more. <end>  should've paid attention to the other reviews  The rose gold finish didn't even last a day. The stone is pretty. Maybe I should've gotten a plain silver setting. <end>  Rose gold faded in one wear, causes irritation.  I bought these because I love anything rose gold. I figured I was taking a chance given that it was rose gold over sterling silver, and I was right. After a single wear, the rose gold wore off IN MY EARS, leaving my earring holes red and irritated. I couldn't wear earrings for a few days after wearing these because my ears were infected due to the gold wearing off the posts into my ears. The earrings are now an icky dark silvery/black color along the posts/bottom of earring. If you have sensitive ears, steer clear of these. <end>  Okay  These earrings are pretty, but the rose gold on the posts is turning black. I've only worn a few times. <end>  cool colored earrings  these earrings have such a vibrant wine color and can go with any other earrings i have on. only reason i give it four stars is that it really irritated my ears after a couple of days, so people with sensitive ears beware. <end>  Size fyi  A very good product so far for me, but I would recommend a slightly smaller size if you are looking for something for a second or third piercing. They are *almost* too big... I would go with 2 or 3 mm instead. <end>
 B000PSCZX2  Certified Diamond (Emerald, Good cut, 7.02 carats, D color, IF clarity) ||	  Even better when it is free!  On a dark and stormy night, I sneaked into the Amazon factory and was snooping around. I saw this sitting on the shelf in a glass case. It looked so sad. Just all captured and imprisoned in there. It looked at me with the most adorable eyes, like that cat's eyes from Shrek 2, and said; "Please, sir, can I have some freedom?" I was so blazed out of my mind that I clearly believed that a diamond would be talking to me. I agreed and punched my fist straight through the case it was being held in, and boy did hell break loose. The loudest most fierce alarm I have ever heard went off, and, out of nowhere the alien/robot guards came at me. They all started shouting and sounded a lot like Tony Stark from Ironman 2. I pretty much screamed like a little girl at the sight of this and in my time of fear, grew amazing, magical, blue wings. I took the diamond in my hands and gave it a big long hug. The robots were closing in on me and I figured it was time to leave,before I got captured by them and sent back to the Russian prison in Siberia. I spread my wings and let out a ferocious roar, "ROAR." I flapped my wings so hard that it knocked the robots down and thrust myself into the air. The amazon factory, being made entirely of glass and gold, was quite easy to burst out of, I had little trouble breaking through the glass roof. I flew out and saw the city below me. ME and Diamond, for that is what I shall call him, screamed in excitement. "IN EXCITEMENT!" I flew diamond back to my house, which was just down the street from the Amazon factory and walked up to my doorway, which happens to be the underpass of a bridge. I showed diamond his first step toward freedom, he looked at me blankly and said, "Wake up little Jody!" I was certainly confused at this and couldn't understand why Diamond would be telling me to wake up, I already was awake. However, Diamond just kept repeating himself, over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and overrr.......My eyes snapped open in time to see my bus drive past my stop, I had clearly missed it. I saw the half smoked bag of weed sitting next to my bed on my nightstand along with a well-read copy of Gulliver's Travels. I sat up swiftly and looked down at my floor, amidst the dirty socks and laundry there was something else, something that looked like... No. It couldn't be, but then again, it was. It was there, right before me; Diamond himself, safe and sound, sleeping in my dirty laundry. I took one more look to make sure I really was awake, rushed to the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face- yes I really was in reality. I walked, no, waltzed, back to my room in excitement; Diamond was here, with me, all safe and sound. I gave Diamond a nudge and woke him up, and together we wrote this review. &lt;3 <end>
 B000PSKGVA  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Champagne CZ 4mm Round Stud Earrings ||	  WOW factor studs  I love these little stud earrings!! There just the rite size and look really fancy!! I would recommend these studs for anyone that wants a classy look! <end>
 B000PSN36U  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Ruby 4mm Round Stud Earrings ||	  great gift  I bought this for my mother, she liked them so much I bought the emerald and sapphire ones for her as well! She really loves them. The stones are very nice! <end>
 B000PSRO8I  14K Yellow Gold Rectangular Rolo Link Bracelet 7.2" ||	  Great Rolo Bracelet Purchase  I bought this item as a gift for my daughter because I wanted something more "personal" than a gift certificate. I wasn't sure if this was a wise choice since jewelry is hard to buy for someone else due to varying preferrences. The bracelet looked great, my daughter wears it all the time and loves it, as do all her friends who have complimented her on it. The price was right for a great gift! <end>
 B000PSU8OA  14k Yellow Gold Oval Mother with Baby Cameo Pendant ||	  Great Gift For A New Mother  This was a great gift for my wife. It was a push gift, yes it's real, for our first child. It is a high quality gift, she loved it. The only thing that I would change is that the eye opening for a chain needs to be a little bigger, I was not able to use the rope chain that I already had. I bought a small flat chain. <end>
 B000PTJ4X0  SCER178 Sterling Silver Crystal and Cloisonne Bead Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Cloisonne Elegance  I love the colors of the deep blue butterflies contrasting the light pink flowers underneath. I also appreciate the ease of the clasp and the fact that they are .925 silver clasps as I cannot wear cheap metal jewlery. <end>  Old world charm at small price  The Swarovski crystal and sterling silver earrings are elegant and look like they cost much more than their actual small price! <end>  Earrings  This pair of earrings were nice but the gold detailing on them was not complete so I was rather disappointed. <end>  "Attractive" is right!  Very striking colors. Given as a Christmas gift, and she loved them. Larger than I was expecting; I thought they would be about the size of a dime, but they were more like nickles, maybe even a tiny bit larger. Still absolutely beautiful. If my sister hadn't wanted them, I would have kept them for myself! <end>  beautifull earrings  these earrings are just beautiful... they are not too big nor too small,, very nice. can use them for day or night time... thank you for your great service and price... <end>  Poor quality  These earrings would have been lovely if they had consistent quality. The gold detailing on one earring is quite heavy, but very complete, while the gold detailing on the other is extremely light and messy. Was going to give these as a gift, but not now - I've seen nicer looking things from the dollar store. <end>  cute earrings  i've bought these earrings as a christmas gift for my co-worker and she absolutely loved them. the pair came in a cute little pouch and was absolutely immaculate with very nice deep colors and detailed golden outlines. i think earrings will look even better over the time when the earwires get slighly tarnished <end>  Elegant and unique earrings  I was drawn to these earrings at first sight. I love the beautiful contrast of the colors and how the clasp adds to its appeal. The size is perfect and both sides have the same picture. I would've given a 3.5 because on one side of the earring, the gold appears moderately dulled/lacking in luster (gold) when compared to the other 3 sides. All in all, I give it a 4 because of it's uniqueness and it was the first time my boyfriend complimented me on them. <end>  Everything they appeared to be  These were a fine pair of earrings for a nice price. Quality was good, construction was competent, and they have a very nice appearance. <end>  DELIGHTED IN WV  I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE MERCHANDISE AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE EARRINGS WERE BEAUTIFUL AND THEY CAME VERY QUICKLY <end>  beautiful earrings  These are beautiful earrings. I receive many compliments every time I wear them. I purchased the small rose and quartz stud earrings to wear with these and they are great together. They are not too long or too big. The art work on them is beautiful and I like the leverback style. <end>  Gem Avenue Rocks!  I received quite a few pieces of jewelry from Gem Avenue. They are all excellent. Well crafted and artistic, I especially liked these earrings. <end>  Earrings  These earrings were on my daughter-in-law's wish list - but I was a it hesitant in purhcasing sight unseen. But when they arrived in such a short amount of time and I saw the quality and beauty I wished I had pered ears to have gotten a set for myself.These earrings made a beautiful birthday gift. They are wel made and not "cheap" looking. And the delivery was fast.Thank you for making a birthday special.L. Reynolds, Las Vegas NV <end>  A CLASSIC LOOK  These were for a special gift for friend who enjoys classic,nice things,they are very pretty and make great gift,the coloring on them is great and they look very elegant,packaging made gifting easy a very nice addition to earring wear. <end>  Very pretty earrings  I bought these earrings as a gift for my mom and they were very well received. She loves them, they are really pretty and a good size and shape. <end>  Good deal for the price  These earrings are really pretty but bigger than what I expected, hence the 4 stars. I have received compliments whenever I have worn them and overall am very pleased with this perchase. How could you go wrong at this price?! The only other issue I have with them is that the hooks are silver yet the decoratative color around the edges of the beads are gold, not the best match, should have been silver also, but really not too important an issue. <end>  GOES WELL WITH MY CLOTHING.  SOME WHAT EXOTIC LOOKING.GOES WELL WITH BLACK OR A LIGHT COLOR.LEVER BACKS PREVENT LOSING THEM.WOULD BUY AGAIN. <end>  lever backs are small  I recently received these earrings. The design overall was pretty clear. However, be aware that if you have thicker earlobes (as I do), the lever-back hoop may be too small. It just fit my ears. Otherwise a nice earring for the price. <end>  A bit cheap looking...  Cute earrings but cheap looking. I was somewhat embarrassed to give these as a gift.. Luckily my 4 year old gave them as a gift and grandma loved them! <end>  Beautiful  I just love these earrings.I`ve always liked the cloisonne style of jewelry.My favorite kind are lever backs also,you never loose your earrings.I`m going to wear these Christmas eve! <end>  SCER178 EARRINGS.  I'm very satisfied with these earrings. They are just the right size and are beautifully made. I bought them because the colors are my basic colors that Iwear often.They were the right price as well. <end>  Beautiful  Very nice earrings! My sister-in-law loved them. Came quickly, packaged in a nice box. Overall, good purchase. They were a good size - not too big, not too small. <end>  Swarovski Elements Crystal & Cloisonne Bead Sterling Silver Drop Earrings  Decent pair of earrings, colors blend well, and can be dressed down or up, depending on the occasion. They're a nice size, and nice comfortable clasp. I purchased these as a gift with a pair of stud earrings, and matching bangle bracelets as well, and they absolutely loved it. Overall, the earrings are probably not the best quality; nevertheless, they'll workout just fine.Made with Swarovski Elements Crystal & Cloisonne Bead Sterling Silver 1.5" Long Drop Earrings <end>  Pretty, but not quite quality earrings.  These are very unique earrings that are light-weight and easy to put through my pierced ears. However, the gold outlining was missing in some parts, but heavy in other areas. It just doesn't look quality made to me. On the plus, I get a lot of compliments on the earrings since they are larger and stand out with my hair pulled back. <end>  Cloisonne earrings  These earrings are very pretty! I really like the butterflies painted on them w/the black painted background. I would recommend this items for everyone! <end>
 B000PU51FE  Sterling Silver .925 Genuine Emerald Stone Oval Small Stud Earrings ||	  Love Them!  These are the most sturdy earings I own. They don't bend easily, haven't tarnished, and the backs stay put. They are feminine and cute. <end>  Emerald pierced earrings  EXCELLENT PRODUCT! SUPER FAST SHIPPING! EASY ORDERING PROCESS! I LOVE ORDERING FROM AMAZON! THANK YOU!! <end>
 B000PUOR1S  One Silicone Hider Plug Version 1  1/2", Wearable Length  5/16" (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  awesome for job interviews  Not only do I not think these look stupid, but most of the time people don't even realize I have them in. And it works great for job interviews. Especially if you put a pair of pierced earrings through the plugs, it's even easier to look like you git into the norm. Maybe it works better for those of us with 1/2" and smaller? I'm not sure. Also, pay attention to the color. <end>  Look stupid  These look extremely stupid. You are better off just getting a clear pair if you need to hide your gauges. <end>
 B000PUTIL2  One Silicone Hider Plug Version 1  8g, Wearable Length  5/16" (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  Is there anything like this for a septum piercing?  Note  The rating is based off what it was needed it for. We do not know how this product works in an ear.We need something to hide a septum piercing, but nothing other than the usual staples or posts was able to be found. This sort of works in the nose okay, but is still fairly visible. Pops in and out super easy so it was lost in a tissue. Work requirements demand something like this rather than a standard septum retainer, and until something better is made this does good enough for now. <end>  Paler than they look, but still great for concealing piercings  This was a bit too pale to hide my 8g ear piercings as well as, perhaps, the version 1.5 Kaos hider plug. At 10', however, I passed for unpierced. Bonus if your lobes are pale. Great for piercing enthusiasts with professional aspirations. You should, however, probably get these through your local body piercing outlet, or at least consult them for a color choice. <end>  AWESOME!  These are the greatest! So easy to pop in and out, I don't need to use a stretcher. The color matches my skin tone exactly. I pierced mine so now, when I don't want to wear my cool 8g jewelry, I can wear regular earrings too and nobody is the wiser! My CZ studsPlatinum Plated Sterling Silver 7x7 mm Cushion-Cut Cubic Zirconia Stud Post Earringscover the front of these plugs so that you can't see them at all. <end>
 B000PV9ODS  Classic Smooth Puffed Teardrop Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Nice earrings  Great product. Arrived promptly and appear to be good quality. Lightweight and thus nice to wear. Why does this have to be 10 words I don't have that much to say about earrings. <end>  Cute  A bit lager than wat I was expecting. They look very good when I have them on. I am glad I purchased these. Nice casual look. <end>  Sort of ok, sort of.  It looks shiny, but has a dull look at first glance, and it's very light. Should have checked out review, before I place the order. <end>  Classic and pretty!  I love silver jewelry, and have been coveting a simple, but elegant pair of earrings....these fit the bill!!! They are just pretty and compliment any outfit. It's a nice switch from silver hoops all the time. <end>  Disappointed  I ordered these for my daughter-in-law for christmas this year 2012 and am very disappointed. They appear very cheaply made. The hoop portion of the earrings were bent and not smooth. I will not be giving them as a gift. I would not recommend these for anyone. <end>  Love them.  I have been looking for these earings. And i love them. Looks like good quality sterling silver. and will be ordering again soon. <end>  Great pair of earrings  I always get compliments when I wear this pair of earrings. They go with many styles of outfits. <end>  Ordered 3 of these as sepearate gifts  These earrings were as advertised and the price was right. The problem for me was I ordered all 3 as a "gift" and all 3 came in one velvet pouch. Now I'm stuck finding pouches or boxes to give the other 2 sets out as gift to my wife and 2 adults daughters for Valentines Day. <end>  SENT WRONG PAIR  I ORDERED THIS PAIR OF EARRINGS PLUS TWO OTHER PAIRS FROM THE SAME COMPANY. THE OTHER TWO PAIRS WERE GREAT BUT INSTEAD OF THE TEARDROP EARRINGS THERE WAS AN ERROR AND I WAS GIVEN THE WRONG ITEM. THE WRONG PAIR ARE NOT SOMETHING I LIKE AND HAVE NEVER WORN. I EMAILED THE COMPANY AND NEVER HEARD BACK. IT IS NOT WORTH MY TIME TO TRY TO SEND THIS BACK. THIS WAS EVEN MORE DISCOURAGING SINCE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER ORDERED JEWELERY ONLINE. <end>  Beautiful (and inexpensive)  I ordered these in late December 2008. They were shipped quickly and arrived in great condition with a small, velvety pouch for storage. The price is difficult to beat. The silver is highly polished, so I hope it holds up. They still look great three months from purchase, and I wear them at least once a week. They've worked well for both dressy occasions and more casual wear, and have earned several compliments from coworkers and students. I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for inexpensive silver jewelry that doesn't look or feel inexpensive. <end>  Just perfect!  A few days ago I had insomnia, and, not being able to sleep, decided to browse Amazon to see what caught my eye.I was very happy to see the "Classic Smooth Puffed Teardrop Sterling Silver Hook Earrings", as they looked exactly the same than a pair of silver earrings I had bought in Argentina and then lost, after using them for a long time. I know that buying jewelry without seeing it firsthand can be tricky, but as the saying goes, "Nothing risked, nothing gained".The earrings arrived quickly, and I was pleasantly surprised that they looked exactly the same than the earrings I had lost, albeit maybe a little bit smaller. They are elegant, delicate, and you can use them in many different occasions. What is more, and due to the fact that they are hollow, they are not heavy, something that can be annoying when earrings are concerned. I am really surprised that they don't rank higher in the jewelry ranking.On the whole, highly recommended! <end>  Love them  Love these earrings. Very lightweight. So lightweight, I didn't notice when one fell out of my ear and got lost. Would be nice if they came with earring nuts. <end>  Great Light weight  I received these as a gift and loved them! They do need a backing of some kind as they easily slip from the ear. They looked exactly like the picture and have held up well, even when my Toddler grabs them and takes off! <end>  Small  Small, lightweight, not as pretty as they are in picture and just generally look a little cheaper. Maybe good for a tween? <end>  Classic Smooth Puffed Teardrop Sterling Silver Hook Earrings  I bought these earrings for me and for my mother as a gift.Both of us like them to wear almost every day.They are very stylish and light. <end>  Puffed Hearts  These sterling silver puffed heart earrings are top quality. They are light weight and thus do not cause strain on my ear lobes. They are bright and shiny and well constructed. Because they are so light weight I wear stoppers on the wires to protect from loss. <end>  Beautiful!  My daughter is very picky about her jewelry choices, but she actually chose these for herself as a gift from us at Christmas. She loves them! <end>  Tear Drop  these are great classic earrings they get at lot of compliments. Makes me feel great about my self and about the earrings when people notice. We shall see how they hold up to wear and tear. <end>  Teardrop earings  Got these for myself and absolutely love them. So pretty and shinny! Enjoy wearing! Good quality and just right size. <end>

These are great, simple earrings that can be worn to either dress up or dress down an outfit. Very fun and flirty! <end>  perfect  These earrings are simple, shiny, and light on the earlobe. Perfect for everyday wear. I had a similar pair in stainless steel that pulled on my ears, making them red and sore. These do not hurt my ears. I highly recommend them. <end>  BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS!  THESE EARRINGS ARE SO NICE, THEY LOOK LIKE WHITE GOLD! THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH TO GO WITH THE MOST DRESSED UP LOOK TO JEANS TO SHORTS! THEY COMPLIMENT EACH OUTFIT YOU WEAR WITH THEM. THEY ARE REALLY SHINY AND SPARKLY AND DROP DOWN JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH! BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS!!! <end>  Nice earrings  Nice earrings and what a great deal. I will definitely buy more items from this seller again. Thanks for the fast shipping also. <end>  Sterling Silver Drop Earrings with Wire Hook  These earrings are very comfortable, and they're lovely to look at. I especially like the wire and the length of the wire...I don't have to worry about the wires coming out of my ear, like I do when I wear normalFrench wires. I just wish I could find more earrings with wires like this. <end>  I love these  I just love these earrings. I bought them three years ago and have been waring them almost every day since then. It's so rare that I love something that much. <end>  Beautiful!  I bought these as a gift for my mom, and I love them so much I wish I'd bought two pairs! They're delicate looking, but durable at the same time. Great value! <end>  Nice  I've had mine for about 6 months and although they seem to be not as silver (a little tarnished) as they were when first purchased, I like wear these to work from time to time. I need to clean them to bring the shine back. <end>
 B000PVYFPU  18K Rose Gold over Sterling Silver Created Blue Opal 6x4 Oval Stud Earrings ||	  BLUE OPAL EARRINGS  These earrings are solid make, not flimsy. Long post and secure backings. Color of opal is outstanding. I have a pair just like these only in sterling silver settings. I gave these rose gold ones to my sister for her birthday to match a blue opal bracelet that she has. I knew they would be quality, since I was happy with mine. Thanks so much. <end>  great opals  I have been using these in my third hole, and while they are on the small side, that's an advantage when you have 2 earrings together on one lobe. I have had several compliments for these, more than for the fancier gold pair I'm wearing with them. The blue color is lovely. All in all, I'm very happy with these opal studs, and would recommend them to a friend. <end>  Lovely Earrings  These earrings are a plus for any woman & young lady. The rose gold complements the opal so nicely, the post's are long and the backs are very small but durable. My pair came in promptly with case and receipt document for authenticity. Now on my pair the blue opal is very vibrant almost like a cobalt blue the one's shown here are more like a baby blue, but my pair stands out elegantly and dramatically with my dark curly hair I love them! I highly recommend these they are good quality and the price no one can beat. its a win win I find . <end>  Very Tiny, Very Cute  These are so simple and pretty. They make great "every day" earrings. I love the color of the blue stone as well. I bought them as a gift for someone, and wished I had bought them for myself! <end>  Earrings  I'm very pleased with my purchases! All of my items (different colors) arrived promptly, and as described. They look like the real thing! <end>  beautiful  These earrings are beautiful! Kind of smaller than I expected, but they are very well made and very pretty! My wife loves them! <end>  Daughter's Birthday  We bought these firey opal earrings with an antique (rose gold) finish for daughter's birthday. She was delighted! <end>  Perfect for young teens just beginning to wear earrings  Rose Gold Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Fiery Created Blue Opal Stone oval EarringsI gave my nieces these earrings for Christmas and they were thrilled with their beauty and their mother was delighted with their simplicity. The girls said they were their first "good" jewelry and they looked smashing on them. Beautifully made with the subtle and mysterious shades of the opal, they've become a cherished part of these early teens' collections. <end>
 B000PW72EK  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Created Blue Opal 6x4 Oval Stud Earrings ||	  opal earrings 18K over Sterling Silver  It's hard to find nice color in opal earrings at an affordable price. I love, love, love these. I would highly recommend them to anyone. <end>  Not for sensitive ears  Bought these thinking they were a cheaper alternative to solid gold but they have proven to be irritating to both my and my daughters' ears. Maybe for those without a sensitivity to non-gold, they would work. They are pretty, but we are limited in how long we can wear them. <end>  Very Nice Opal Earrings  These are very pretty simulated opal earrings. Since they are so cheap I don't know if the gold colored mounts will tarnish or not, but as of now they look very expensive. I am pleased with them. The mounts and posts look to be 24K Gold though they aren't. The stones are a lovely, iridescent color. <end>
 B000PWE3G0  Oval Cut Solitaire CZ Sterling Silver Ring ||	  looks so real!!!!!!  I got my ring on July 12, 2012 and I can't stop looking at it. Everyone that has seen it is so upset that it is not on their hand. Great ring! Will go to this dealer again. Thank you! <end>  Lovely!  I bought this ring on a whim, knowing that for the price I paid, it probably would not be much of a much, but liking the simplicity of it. When it arrived, I was stunned. This ring is beautiful. It is a solitaire that sparkles and is just the right size not to look fake but still large enough to draw compliments. I am wearing it now and feel quite proud of myself for buying this bargain and getting a really gorgeous ring. If you like the picture, this is exactly what you will get. <end>
 B000PWHGYG  Two Tone Sapphire CZ Vintage Style Ring ||	  Not happy!  I'm really disappointed with this purchase. I thought the ring looked beautiful online but when it arrived it's in person appearance was much lower quality than the picture indicated - it just looks a bit cheap and tinny. If I'd seen the ring in person, $35-40 is probably the most I'd pay for it. For almost $70, I expected a high quality product even if it was sterling silver and CZs.Still, I wore the ring out and got quite a few compliments on it so would have been inclined to give a more positive rating if one of the smaller fake sapphires didn't fall out THE FIRST DAY I wore the ring. I definitely wouldn't recommend this vendor to anyone nor will I buy from them again - which is really too bad - they have a lot of cute jewelry designs. <end>
 B000PWIP3M  Sterling Silver .925 Fiery Created Pink Opal Stone Oval Small Stud Earrings ||	  Beautiful earrings  I ordered 4 pairs of these opal earrings (1 pink (silver sterling), 1 in blue (silver sterling) and 2 blue (rose gold over sterling silver)).The order was shipped and delivered timely. 1 day after placing the order, silverspeck sent me a confirmation email stating that my order was shipped. I could not track my order since it was sent with USPS, and although there was a confirmation number, USPS did not update the status. I did not mind that since my order was recieved in 8 days.The earrings are defectless and perfect. The color of the stone is so pretty. I adored the fierce, not so dark, not so light colored pink with changing colors of the opal. The size is perfect too, not too small, not too big. Just the right size for everyday wear.All of the pairs are in perfect condition. They also came with blue jewelry pouches, perfect for giving as a gift. Great quality for such a low price. <end>  Better Than Expected  In addition to being completely satisfied with this transaction, I am also extremely pleased with the items that were purchased. These are exactly the pink fire opal earrings I have been trying to find! No, wait--That isn't quite right--Actually these earrings are much prettier and of a better quality than I had anticipated so I'm pleasantly surprised--quite unexpected; Okay, that's enough about me. My items arrived before I expected them to arrive and in better condition than I thought they would--beautiful pieces! I would definitely buy from this seller again. <end>
 B000PWVSKY  Sun Symbol and Gemstone Earrings ||	  well...  well i do like them, they are very pretty. but they are a little cheap, very light and they feel kind of flimsy. but once you put them on no one will be able to tell. if you really like the way they look, i would get them, but keep in mind that they're not going to be extremely nice as far as the make, but they are comfortable and they look great. if your looking for very well made earrings these are not the ones to get. i would still recommend them, but i think how much you will like them depends on what your looking for. <end>  AWESOME  BETTER THAN THE PIX. MY FAV EARRINGS........WELL MADE, AND I RECEIVED THEM QUICKLY....THANKS <end>
 B000PWXF0A  Earrings - Jasper - Colors Will Vary ||	  Rainforest and Jasper  The item is just what I wanted. The arrival time was great and the packaging kept it safe and secure. <end>  jasper earrings  The earrings are smaller than I expected them to be, but they go fine with the necklace I was trying to match. They came quickly and I am very happy to have them. <end>  Wonderful colors  This is such a wonderful pair of earrings. You wish each jasper was bigger, but yet, they are perfect the size that they are. Jasper is a great stone and the combination here stands out. A beautiful pair of earrings. <end>
 B000PWZ7QK  Earrings - Carnelian Flower with Peridot ||	  Delicate Carnelian Flower  I LOVE these earrings, which are unusual and beautiful at the same time. They are a lovely color that just pops, and a GREAT size since I don't like over-large jewelry. However, they seem like they will be pulled apart if they hook onto a phone or in someone's hair as you give a hug. The wire is very moveable, unfortunately.Such a curious, wonderful addition to my jewelry, but I rated four stars since I'll have to be cautious when wearing them. <end>  Carnelian flowers  These are beautiful and dainty earrings. I had no idea how they would appear until I saw them in the box. I have them on right now! They are unique and I am quite impressed with them. <end>
 B000PX0TVM  Moon Earrings - Red Howlite ||	  Earrings  Service was excellent, product is very high quality, I will purchase from this seller again in the future. <end>
 B000PXPEIK  Sterling Silver Sodalite Inlay Drop Earrings ||	  very cute!  Really comfortable but interesting everyday type of earring. The silver is nice and bright and the soladite is pretty. I wear them often at work. <end>  too small  I thought they were bigger. The silver post were fine but the blue sodalite was way too small.The posts stand out more than the sodalite. <end>  Smaller than expected  Although they are very pretty, they are very very small - I was disappointed because they are a Christmas gift for my boss. I will give them to her anyway as they are pretty. <end>  Gave as a gift  Gave as a gift ...recipient was impressed..she wears only dangle earrings with stone or gemstones..the color of the stones were accurately represented by the picture <end>  Drop Earrings  These earrings are cute, but the stones are really smaller than the picture shows. They would be better for a young girl. <end>  Classy and versatile  The earrings are classy enough to go with an outfit for work, yet versatile enough to be worn with jeans. Love them! <end>
 B000PXSJ2S  Sterling Silver Emerald Cut Pink Cubic Zirconia Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ||	  Not real silver  This is a beautiful ring but after a few wears the silver faded n turned my finger green It's not real sterling silver <end>
 B000PY2QTO  14k White Gold Moissanite 3 Stone Lucern Past-Present and Future (1.00 cttw equivalent), Size 6 ||	  beyond beatiful ring  First of all, the ring doesn't look anything like the picture. It's BETTER! The stones are super sparkly and the gold on the band is nice and substantial, not thin and flimsy. The best part is the stones. They are beautiful; the center stone is maybe around .50 ct and the two side stones are .25. Since they are smaller weight stones, they look very white, and of course have a ton of sparkle. The three stones are set side by side and their fire bounces off each other beautifully. However, the total carat weight is 1 ct, so the ring will fit better on smaller hands. I have a size 5 finger, and it looks great, but I'd think a size 6 is the most you can go unless you like very petite rings. The 2 ct. ring would be perfect for the larger sizes. Definitely a keeper. <end>
 B000PYJJZ8  Beads Green Cuff "Wonder Woman Lives! Cuff [Green]" -Fair Trade Gifts ||	  Gift for a Friend  Neat Concept. Although the reference Wonder Woman was a little hard to figure out. <end>
 B000PYJKAC  Glass Beads Black Bracelet-Woven "Make a Statement Bracelet [Woven - Black]" -Fair Trade Gifts ||	  An attractive look!  This is a nice looking bracelet (band), and I was interrested in all the beads attached. It is all elastic but one of the rows was a kind of weak and started to hang loose right from the start! I did not want to return for an excange, because I didn't want to spent more money on it, since it was quite on the price - I thought! Still not a bad bracelet if you look for something new! <end>
 B000PYKTW0  Glass Beads Aqua Necklace "Berry Revolution Necklace [Aqua]" -Fair Trade Gifts ||	  beaded necklaces  I wasvery pleased with 5 necklaces I bought from this company. They were great quality and inexpensive price. The colors are beautiful. Great deal. <end>
 B000PYKVC8  Glass Beads and Wire Dark Blue Cuff "Freedom Cuffs Cuff [Dark Blue]" -Fair Trade Gifts ||	  blue bracelet  This is a wonderful bracelet. It matches my daughters graduation dress. We like it so much, we might purchase another one. We received it in a great amount of time; arrived sooner than we thought and the price was great! <end>
 B000PYKWTA  Glass Beads Red Bracelet "Bundle of Joy Bracelet [Red]" -Fair Trade Gifts ||	  Not just "Good", great!  Beautiful bracelet, well crafted. I see no loose ends and all beads are secure.Arrived in a timely manner, in four days, when the estimate was 3-7 days.I'm definately considering wearing this to an upcoming formal event.Will order from Original Good again! <end>
 B000PYMEAU  Wire and Copper Brown Bracelet "Thar Desert Bracelet [Brown]" -Fair Trade Gifts ||	  Very different  This bracelet is very unique. It runs large in size. I gave it 3 stars because the wires can stick your wrist and snag clothes. <end>
 B000PZB5PY  Enhanced Black Cultured Pearl Necklace Strand Platinum Overlay Sterling Silver, Bracelet & Earrings Set ||	  STAY AWAY! Look like painted pearls - with paint peeling off!  These look great in the picture online but in reality the pearls look like they were covered with a black coat of paint and was peeling off in some parts. The packing also looked old. Disappointing. Probably the seller sent me a bad product. I had to go through some trouble with the seller to get a return shipping label. <end>  Roger Garrelts  I bought this matching set as a gift for my wife. I had never heard of Dahlia, but it turned out to be everything that I had hoped it would. I will do business with them again. <end>  A very great deal  I was very impressed with the item. The look of the pearls is amazing. The clasp looks great and is much better than a normal clasp. A very elegant yet affordable set. <end>
 B000PZML48  14K Yellow Gold Box Bracelet 7" - 0.47 grams ||	  'Thin' Bracelet  The 14K Yellow Gold Bracelet I ordered came on time and in perfect condition. The product itself however was not what I expected. The picture they give is a little deceiving. The bracelet, although is the stated 7 in., is very thin. I did keep it and will wear it at times even though you can bearly see it. I wouldn't recommend it. <end>
 B000PZYGAK  Grill Shine Polishing Cloth ||	  Blitz Grill Shining Cloths and Grill Wipes  Both of these products are the BEST. If you have a silver grill, they will keep it shiny and looking like new. <end>
 B000Q00Q2Q  Butterfly & Beads Belly Button Ring ||	  Not so great  The chain broke right off, and all of the coloring turned a rusty color. Will never be able to wear again. <end>  Cute but pic is a bit misleading  There is practically NO silver in this belly ring, it's almost all gold/copper and the butterfly is pretty small. it was a gift i wouldn't be thrilled if i had actually purchased it myself. <end>  Cute!  Very cute, smaller than it looks on here though.The only thing is that at first it really itched, and it because the coating around the ball on top was peeling off, but I pulled it right off and its good as new. <end>  few problems  The picture is misleading. This ring is actually more gold, than silver, which threw me off, because I like silver much better. It's actually a silver base with gold painted over it, it seems like. I know this because the gold paint is peeling off of the top screw. Honestly, it doesn't bother me a whole lot, and it's not noticeable (kind of hoping it peels off and becomes just silver). Very cute, very comfortable, overall I'm happy! <end>
 B000Q30G4Q  Rd St John Pend Medal Sterling Silver ||	  Little but nice  Product is tiny, much smaller than I expected. This was an impulse buy and had I researched a little more on the net I could have found this medal for half the price. But it is what it is, and it is small, but well made and nice looking, just order a magnifying glass at the same time. <end>
 B000Q5PVD0  Gold Label Illuminated Music Box, Ice Skaters ||	  I think I received a used item  The box the music box was in was very worn and had clearly been opened and closed many times. One of the edges of the music box itself was also worn. It looks like someone used it every year at Christmas then resold it. It was advertised as new. <end>
 B000Q5WAOI  Necklace Cord For Pendants - D39 - Black Silk / Satin - 16" + 2" Extension Chain ~ Silver Tone Ends ||	  Great quality and value  I purchased 3 of these to use with cartouches I had bought in Egypt. They fit on the cord perfectly and it has held up very well over the past 3 months. The adjustable length is great b/c you can vary it depending on the neckline of your top. Highly recommended. <end>  Great!  Nice look, no fraying, solid connection to silver clamps unlike many of the rubber tube neclaces. <end>  Not yet used  Unfortunately the clasp was too large for me to slip on the pendant. My other wonder is why it wasn't packaged as a circle, instead of it being folded. Didn't make sense. <end>  perfect  I'm pleased with my purchase. Your service was in a timely fashion. I look forward to shopping here again. <end>  Made Well...  This cord is a replacement for a necklace I purchased elsewhere. The original cord was not very well secured in the clasp department. This cord is much better, much more durable to hold the charm I have for it. Even after tugging at it a little, it still doesn't fall apart. Thanks for supplying such a product! <end>  cord necklace  Very nice, good price and works perfectly with the pendant I have. Fast delivery. Very satisfied <end>  good value  This necklace cord has brought new life to silver pendants that I just use to wear on silver chains. That it is adjustable and has a large lobster claw clasp makes it even more of a good value. <end>  Works great, but not durable.  I bought this item for use with a necklace pendant, and it works great for the purpose. But I've had it for about 3 months now, and the clasp is wearing out, and a couple of times I've had it randomly come off because the chain links were slipping out of the clasp. I tend to fiddle with the necklace a lot though, and I wear it constantly. So if it's something you're only going to wear occasionally, then this is will work great! Otherwise, I suggest maybe finding something a little sturdier. <end>  Long enough  Perfect for the pendant I had given my old boyfriend, he wore it with pride and i didn't have to ask for more. <end>  WISHED iI HAD GOTTEN LEATHER  i LIKE THIS OK BUT I WISHED I HAD GOTTEN LEATHER BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS WILL LAST VERY LONG <end>  great for pendants and other jewelry  I would give this a 5 but I worry how long the clasp will stay on the satin, it does not seem adhered too securely. Otherwise this is great for your pendants if you don't want satin you have to tie/untie. <end>  This didn't hold up well  I wore this a couple times with a pretty pressed glass amulet. One night, taking it off, the cord came apart from the metal in my hand. I have since bought black leather cord (for $4.88, from Wal-mart) and created my own cord, knotted at the back, to slip over my head. Not as good, but at least it won't rot or separate on me. <end>  Not What I expected  The necklace Cord for Pendants was not the size I expected. By that I mean that the cord was very narrow. It did not have the thickness that I thought that I was getting and the clasp was so small that most would people find it hard to use. An extremely very poor value at $5.49 for each one! <end>  okay, but won't buy it again.  works for its purpose, but it looks a bit cheap to me...not that happy with it.. <end>
 B000Q60T2W  Necklace Cord For Pendants - D42 - Black Velvet Flock - 16" + 2" Extension Chain ~ Silver Plated Ends ||	  long lasting!  mine got a little bent so it's not perfect, but the velvet has a nice texture and I wear it all the time (I've had it for about four months now). I also really like the length; not too long, so I can wear it with pretty much anything--which is exactly what I needed. <end>  Wee bit disappointed  The sterling silver I received has a yellow smoky tint versus the silver/white in the photo and the the extension ends in a teardrop weight rather than a tiny key. Overall, a little disappointed, but I like it enough, would give it a 4.5, but since that's not an option, I rounded it up. <end>  Great feel and a good product.  I received the product four days after ordering it, which was great. I had been expecting at least a week for delivery, so it was awesome to get it so quickly. I purchased it for a pendant I had, the original cord for which had recently snapped. The old cord had been a cheap rubber cord, so I was looking for something a little more sturdy. I wasn't disappointed, and the material used for the new cord seems to be of very high quality, and it should last a long time.The only complaint I have is that the extension twists up easily, but it's really not much of a problem. <end>  Pendant Cord  This cord is perfect for my protection amulet. I wear it daily and it never agitates my sensitive skin. <end>  black cord necklace  No worry about allergies with a cord necklace! The answer to that problem for people like me. In perfect style this day and age too! <end>  necklace cord reciew  The product was delivered fast and accurately. Good product. I used them for necklaces for Swavorski crystal pendants and they were of quality enough to be paired with this type of crystal. <end>  necklace cord  This product was better than I anticiapted, Price was right. Especially with the prompt shipping time! <end>
 B000Q69NC4  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Red Garnet Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11) ||	  Very good deal!  This is a great deal. I was worried it wouldn't look anything like the photo, but it does match perfectly and the quality if great. The garnet is a beautiful colour and looks genuine. Very good buy, definitely worth it. <end>  silver insanity ring  This ring is so pretty. I don't wear it daily but usually 3 times a week. I have had no problems with it and get many compliments. I loved it so much that I bought two more for my daughters in their birthstones. The rings were delivered promptly and packaged nicely. <end>  Beautiful stone!  Wow! After reading all the reviews several times and trying to decide which type of stone to get, I decided on the Genuine Red Garnet. This is truly a beautiful stone! The stone is a bit flat on top (stone lays flush with circular setting)but the color is AMAZING, especially for the price. The stone is redder in person, appearing to be an almost cherry red like hue.It does appear a bit brown at times, but I've been asked if it is a ruby ring. I really wanted a red celtic ring and this is a good choice if you're looking for something like that. It seems to be a good quality stone (based on garnet pictures from google) with nice clarity. The only thing that prevents this from being a "5 star" purchase, is that the celtic design and metal of the ring looks a bit cheap. While I was initially concerned with how the stone would look and how real it would appear, it was the band that ended up being a bit disappointing. It's a sturdy metal and runs true to size. It is still a nice ring and I am extremely happy with my purchase (especially the speedy delivery), I was just a bit surprised by the quality of the metal work. <end>  Lovely birthday present!  -)  I received this as a birthday present for my 30somethingth. As others have mentioned, it was very small and dainty -- much smaller than I expected. (Then again, I didn't quite know WHAT to expect -- I just thought it was pretty when I saw it.) However, the sparkle and fire of the garnet in light are gorgeous! I've only had the ring for a couple of days, so I can't speak to its wear and tear. The sizing is good -- it is not a snug fit but leaves room for the natural swelling that occurs throughout a normal day (or a bad day when my fingers turn into mini-sausages). It passed the "shake test" -- stayed on my finger no matter how hard I shook my hand. The stone is dark when against skin, but the glints of light demonstrate that it really IS a genuine stone, not a chemically-treated stone or created stone. I love this ring! <end>  Love this ring!  I'll start by saying that the picture of this ring doesn't do it justice! It is very pretty. The garnet is more red than brown and sparkles nicely. It's the perfect size & can be worn dressed up or down. I've had it on non stop since I got it and it is very comfortable, doesn't snag on anything and I've gotten several compliments! <end>  Beautiful ring!  I just received my ring today. It's absolutely beautiful! I love garnet. It's such a deep red. This gemstone sparkles beautifully! I am so excited to wear it out! It was shipped alot sooner than I thought it would be so that's a plus also! I definately recommend this ring! <end>  the perfect little ring  Yes, its everything i hoped it would be, in a little garnet ring. nothing too fancy just some silver and red and triquetras. its perfect, and i love it. a prettly little present just for myself. the shipping was lightening fast too. thank you! <end>  Fast shipping, quality product, affordable price  I was very pleased with the speed at which my order was processed, and with the product itself. The stone is VERY lustrous and the band is much more delicate and intricate than I was expecting, based on the pictures. <end>  worth the money  This is a pretty little ring with a rich red stone. The picture given is accurate. I received it in a timely manner. it is sorta of my go-to ring when I want something that looks nice but is not flashy - such as at work. Little touches complete an outfit. I like it. <end>  Still beautiful!  I wanted to write this review after I had the ring for a while because it is really important to me that the shine lasts. Well, it has! I do not wear the ring everyday so there still is a chance for wear and tear but it still shines as much as the day I received it in the mail. The ring came on time and was in simple packaging, so if I was giving the ring as a gift I might wrap it in something different, but the red garnet is dark and intense and the sterling silver is sturdy and glamorous. I don't like chunky rings and this one is petite and delicate looking but not in a way that is looks like it is going to break. I love my birthstone and this rings allows me to appreciate the color. I would recommend this to any January birthday. <end>  Garnet Silver Ring  This ring is wonderful! It was beautiful when we got it in the mail. It shipped quickly and my daughter was very happy with it. <end>  Very nice ring  This ring is much prettier than the picture. The garnet is a deep, rich red. I like this a lot and feel it's a great deal for the money. <end>  beautiful!  the stone shines so beautifully under sunlight. the ring appears exactly as shown in the picture but the stone is so much more alive and is a deeper red than is seen here. <end>  Nice ring  I bought this ring for my wife, and she loves it. The garnet is a good quality, and the Celtic knot setting is a very attractive design.Great purchase & value! <end>  Verrry Pretty!  I could not find a small birthstone for my pinky anywhere! I should have shopped Amazon.com 1st. The Celtic knot is a plus as I am Irish. The quality & price of this ring is outstanding. It is so comfortable I don't even feel it. It is hard for me to find a size 4 ring but I got it at Amazon. I LOVE shopping at Amazon, for everything! Keep up the good work! <end>  Celtic Knot Genuine Garnet  It is a very nice piece of fine jewelry as well as art. I love the Celtic knot design; I never had one before. Garnet looks very good although I should expect a stone to be a bit larger for 1 carat. May be because it is not rectangular but oval cut. Very good buy <end>  Love it  I got the genuine garnet ring hoping tht it was a nice as it looked in the picture. It is perfect. Nice quality and nice color. <end>  Glorious!  I just received this as a Christmas present and it is beyond beautiful! The stone is a rich red and the silver work is very high quality. Any January baby would be proud to wear this garnet birthstone. <end>  Nice ring but where's the proof it's real?  This is a nice ring. Small defect in the silver coming onto the stone but not worth returning. I was expecting to get something with the ring showing that it is a real garnet stone but I didn't. Being that this seller also sells created garnet.. I suppose it's just a matter of trust that you're getting what you pay for. <end>  Garnet Ring  This is a nice quality ring at a reasonable price. It's not ostentatious and it's sturdiness makes it nice for everyday use. <end>  Spend the extra $5 for the GENUINE garnet ring  I just received my ring and I love it. The garnet gemstone is of good quality and a generous size for the price. It sparkles, it is clear, and the color is a deep but intense blood-ish red. It's beautiful. This same company has a similar, but less expensive ring, but notice that the title does not include "Genuine" when describing the garnet. I suggest spending the extra few dollars to get a real gemstone. Other people have complained that the gemstone for the less expensive option is more orange than red, but let me reassure you that the genuine garnet is RED. In addition, the service was great. I received my ring sooner than expected! <end>  Lovely!  This ring is lovely, the picture does not really do it justice. The setting is more delicate than the picture leads you to believe and the stone has a great deal of color. The delivery was very fast too. I'm very satisifed! <end>  simply perfect  this ring is beautiful and simply perfect, its stone is brilliant i was sitting in the sunlight and it sparkles and the color and the detail work the celtic knot and quality of this ring, basically i am beyond pleased with it and my experience with Silver Insanity as a seller was excellent, received confirmation by email and my ring was in my mailbox nicely packed before i was even looking for it. I highly recommend this seller and any merchanside they choose to sell if its as pretty as my ring Thanks! <end>  One Year Later.  I bought this ring for my daughter last year. I was looking for birthday gift ideas and noticed I did not write a review. My daughter loves this ring. She has worn it every day and there has not been any damage. Worth EVERY penny. I hope I find another excellent gift this year. <end>  My Newest Shiny  I recieved the ring just as it's pictured. Beautiful red garnet stone. Great price for the size of the stone. The band is thin enough to look good on small hands (short fingers)as well as sturdy enough it doesn't feel like it will snap if you shake someone's hand. Perfect for everyday wear. The stone oesnt catch on clothing like other settings would. <end>  garnet celtic knot ring  I absolutely think this was a good value. I love the ring. Only thing I had a problem with was being unable to click on size 5. I ended up with a size 6, which is really too big for my ring finger. I am very pleased with the ring, however. I get a lot of compliments on it!!! Thank you. <end>  Garnet Ring  This ring is amazing!! My fiance bought it for me and it was perfect. I am so proud to wear it. The garnet is an amazing deep red and the sterling silver is also very great quality. Thanks!!! <end>  beautiful purchase  I loved this ring. It was for my 13 year old niece who thought it was just gorgeous. I also received my purchase in a timely fashion, especially during the holiday madness. <end>  Perfect  This was a Jan 09 birthday gift for my daughter. She wears it all the time. It looks better on the finger, and does have some sparkle. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Red Garnet Ring  this is a great ring...looks beautiful on and is easy to clean. Would highly recommend it! <end>
 B000Q6RLVO  Kit Heath Needle Earrings ||	  Love 'em!  As a middle aged woman who's always loved earrings I find these to be lightweight, not too long but not staid.........I call them my "to heck with being an old lady" earrings. I get many compliments when I wear them - which is frequently as they go with just about anything. The workmanship is excellent and the ear wires are very comfortable. They were shipped quickly. Very pleased with this purchase and am considering the companion necklace as my next purchase. <end>
 B000Q6XXDO  Kit Heath Modern Silver Drop Earrings ||	  absolutely  stunning!!! I purchased the earrings and a matching necklace...the pricewas right and I cannot wait to view more Kit Heath jewelry over Amazon. <end>
 B000Q74GRU  Sterling Silver Oval Shaped Garnet Cubic Zirconia Celtic Knot Polished Finish 7mm Wide Band Ring Size 6, 7, 8, 9 ||	  Perfect  This was a much better ring than the picture shows. I got it for my girlfriend for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. Fast shipping, great price, and good service. <end>  Worth what you pay for it  I wouldn't say this is a bad ring but it is worth what you pay for it. It definitely isn't as pretty as in the picture. I can clearly see where the sizing cut and weld was done. It also doesn't shine like it does in the picture. The one in the picture seems solid and pretty, the one I received was ehh okay. I probably could have gotten the same or better at a cheap jewelry store. There was some coating on it that turned my finger green the first few times I wore it. It seems to have worn off now but I just wish it was like the one in the picture. If you have money to waste, then go ahead and get it. Otherwise, I'd look around some more. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  My daughter lost her lovely custom class ring (for the second time) and I was looking for a replacement ring that was similar in size and shape...her class ring was an unusual and dainty one. I saw this ring and took a chance with the size. Not only did it arrive quickly, and in time for her birthday, but it is just gorgeous! It is sturdy and nicely made, but delicate in appearance. She has worn it since the day it came, and it doesn't show a sign of wear- the mounting is excellent and the silver is finely done.I will definitely be coming back for more with Gem Avenue- the products are reasonable priced for the quality, and I am totally pleased with what we purchased! Thanks for your fine service and quick processing- I can't recommend enough!Karen Hughes <end>  Very nice!  This ring came very quicklyin the mail and looked exactly as pictured. My granddaughter was very excited to receive it! <end>  I love the setting!  I would absolutely love this ring if the color was a little deeper red. But it's more of an orangey red, which I don't think is as quite as pretty. But I'm still happy with it. Especially the setting. It's well made, and looks really nice on my finger. <end>  Nice ring  I'm very happy with this ring. Good workmanship and a pretty stone. It looks better than pictured. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. <end>  Very Happy  Very nice ring. Purchased one for my wife. Much nicer than the pic. <end>
 B000Q75UK2  Sterling Silver Polished Finish Celtic knot Filigree Band Ring Size 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Very Pleased  I was surprised at the size of the ring. It is very sturdy and well made with a thick band. The cutwork is clean and smooth. A good value for the price. <end>  Love the ring  Very nice ring, not dissapointed at all. I get a lot of compliments, and it fit to size, I wear on my middle finger on my right hand. <end>
 B000Q796YS  Sterling Silver 35mm x 40mm Diamond cut Marvelous Filigree Floral Marcasite 5mm Band Ring Size 9 ||	  love love love it!  i loovve this ring! only bad thing is it leaves a tiny mark on my finger which it really shouldn't for the price i paid, but the ring its self is cute! it fits nice and the size is just right =] <end>  Ring Lover  I love this ring - it is beautiful! i get compliments on it every time i wear it. It is very striking, and yet does not stick up so that it hits everything when you move about. Great pruchase! <end>  Pretty and true to size  Fits great, sparkles in all lighting. Love it!Closest match to an old marcasite I had that my dog ate so I'm happy to have a such a pretty replacement. Thanks! <end>
 B000Q7VGBO  Sterling Silver, Papua Shell, Malachite and Lapis Ring by Sajen, Size 6 ||	  Great product by Sajen!  I love this ring. The perfect match for my abalone (paua shell) collection!Excellent quality. It is reasizable (the base around the finger has a cut so the size can be enlarged if it's needed.) <end>  Nicer than the picture!  The ring is well crafted as all Sajen silver jewelry seems to be as I own several items. I am wearing it on my little finger where it is definitely noticed because of size and design. Love it, purchase recommended... <end>
 B000Q7XHDY  4mm Multifaceted Magnetic Band Hematite Ring ||	  Broken after a month  Loved this ring when it arrived. My mom has had trouble with her one finger locking up so I thought this might help. It did help and was wonderful at first! The stiffness was gone and she raved about it. Then after wearing it for a month, it broke in half. I was disappointed it felt apart so fast. <end>  Healing hematite  I had a stroke a year and a half ago, and have a tightness in my right hand. Since I've been wearing the ring I've had no stiffness in my hand, and I've only been wearing the ring one day. My mother has had multiple operations on her hand. She has a "trigger finger". She's worn the ring one day as well and feels no pain. Definitely recommend for anyone with pain or stiffness. <end>  Delicate item!  Unfortunatly, this ring only lasted me about a month before it was cracked in two by gripping something to hard while I was wearing it... I have always been attraced to hematite and the product is of good quality, but must be treated delicatly or you will snap it half... <end>  Disappointed  I loved this ring. It was comfortable and I liked the way it would catch the light. On the down side the ring just broke into three pieces on day while on my finger, I don't know what happened because I didn't hit my hand against anything. Perhaps this particular item had an unforseen flaw. <end>  unique hematite ring  This is a great ring. When I'm bored at work I stick it to file cabinets and other metal surfaces in my lab. The ring looks neat too. It's small and comfortable to wear, and the facets catch the light beautifully. I recommend this ring for anyone who enjoys magnetic hematite jewelry. <end>  High quality ring for a very low price!  It makes a great conversation starter; I have had quite a few people comment on how nice it looks (the faceted one more so than the smooth one).The 4mm rings aren't too magnetically strong. I can pick up a few paper clips, or stick it to a metal surface, but you won't be able to pick up a metal nail file or a metal pen. The upshot of this is that it's not powerful enough to pose a threat to any electronics with moving metal parts.They also make great inclusions for a Secret Santa gift (assuming you know the person's ring size); very out-of-the ordinary. <end>  Stylish and practical  this ring is not only cute, it reallys helps with pain that I get with my many hours of keyborad work, due to my job. <end>  Kristy Beeman order under Daniel  I love this ring. I have a black diamond engagement ring and it goes perfectly with it. Wear it on right hand... <end>  Great ring  I love this ring. It's really nice for work, adds to your hands without being flashy or gaudy. It's not heavy, it's really great. <end>  I like the style  Got this ring to go with my other one. For my husband. It was scratched but it fit great. No other visual tarnishes to it. The facets are nice as well. It was crafted nicely, just scratches easily. <end>
 B000Q8GBJA  Mens Stainless Steel Serenity Prayer Cuff Bracelet ||	  Handsome / good quality  I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. It's very handsome and sturdy. Anyone who frequents the 12 step meetings or is in recovery would appreciate having the Serenity Prayer on their bracelet to help remind them of where their heart is, and to give them strength. <end>  Serenity Bracelet  I wanted my spouse to have the Serenity prayer with him always, and this bracelet is beautiful. My spouse wears it every day, and the wonderful words are always there for him to reflect on. <end>  Beautiful  Bought this as a gift for my 20 y.o son. Very appropriate for the occasion. He is not a jewelry person per se..but this has a little edge. Wording is not large, but present. Cuff looks sharp on...not shiny.Would look great dressed up or down. Nice price. <end>  Nice  Rather feminine looking, yet it is sized for a mans wrist. A great gift for a female with larger wrists and arms. Good product for the price. <end>  DISAPPOINTED  The bracelet is beautiful, but the words are way to small. I bought this for a friend for his birthday, he had to get a magnifying glass to read the words. I also could not read the words properly. <end>  disappointing  i find the engraved text too small, smaller than visualized in the image showncuff is also not so good since it is not adjustable to wrist size. perhaps a bracelet type would be better... <end>  Not just for men....  My mother is hard of seeing so I picked the men's version. It's perfect. It's not any bigger around the one she had previously (woman's version), and the words can be read! It's been almost a year since I ordered it and the black is still etched in perfectly! <end>  Not quite what I expected  I specifically ordered this product because it was the men's version of the bracelet. There is a regular version available as well from a different vendor. This men's version feels very big on my wrist. It would slide half way up my forearm until I bent it closed. Now it fits, but i can't take it off.Also beware the quality. Stainless steel is pretty hard to mess up, but the writing is another thing. I've had it one about two weeks and half of the black in the stamping has come off. Now, I kind of like the recessed silver on silver look, but others may not. <end>
 B000Q8GCW6  Men's and Women's Stainless Steel Serenity Prayer Ring ||	  Amazing gift  I got this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it. The ring is solid. It has a good weight to it, it doesn't feel cheap at all. <end>  Excellent  Great product, sized right and wonderful value. After purchasing one, I was so impressed, that I purchase 4 more. Their customer service is wonderful and very helpful. <end>  Loved it!  I bought this as a gift for my niece and she absolutely adores it! Great product! <end>  awesome ring!  I love this ring! good quality...the prayer inside is nicely done! sent in a lovely bag inside a cute little box...perfect present! <end>  Very Nice  I bought this as a present to myself as the prayer is a special one. Black embossing came off after the first shower, but can still read the prayer. Would have given a 5 if the lettering would have stayed better. <end>  Wonderful  The product is beautiful and the customer service with this company has been the best I've encountered in a long time. Wonderful product and a wonderful company - what more can you ask for? Thanks! <end>  Size up  The ring is beautiful but I would suggest choosing a size up from normal. Every ring I own is a size 5 but this one would not go past my knuckle. Since I'll lose the cost of return shipping it's not worth exchanging. <end>  Very satisfied  I wear this ring everyday and have no complaints! Great customer service and fast shipping! Convenient to do business with. <end>  doesn't look nice on finger  I bought two of these as bff rings because I love the statement inside. But I was hoping it would be fashionable but its quite ugly. Also the letters fall out even though you can still see the engraved words. <end>  i agree... just average  The ink in the writing held perfectly for a couple weeks and then suddenly starting peeling and was completely gone in a few days. This despite the fact that I never wore it doing dishes or anything similar. I definitely have to strain to read it now. The band is shiny and smooth when you buy it but very quickly starts to get scratches. The ring is solid and is cut in such a way that it isn't exactly comfortable on my finger.On the other hand, it serves its purpose which is to remind me of the serenity prayer. And it's inexpensive enough that I don't feel cheated given the above issues. <end>  We love them  I ordered two of these. One for myself and one for my husband to replace our much battered stirling silver bands.They are much nicer than picture and they fit great.They look great and are much wider than picture seems.Would buy them again.Lightning, free ship, nice boxes and velvet pouch.A whole lot of good stuff for a very low price.Janet BakerBenwood, WV <end>  high quality  product arrived prior to their estimate, excellent quality, I will buy from eves addiction again. <end>  just average  The ring isn't quite as beautiful as in the picture, but otherwise meeats the characteristics of a typical steel ring. The writing inside is etched in and filled with some sort of black ink. The black will come off. The etching stays - you just can't read it as well. <end>  Beautiful, inspiring ring  I bought this ring as a reminder for myself...to try to live the words of the serenity prayer. The stainless steel is shiny and beautiful and the ring is substantial--in weight and width. The words inside are clearly visible. The black ink is beginning to rub off (after about 2 weeks of wearing it everyday), but the engraving is deep enough that I can still see the words. I love this ring and hope to wear it for many years to come. (It helps that stainless is non-allergenic, too...because I'm allergic to most gold.) <end>  Wrong Size  The ring was a gift for my boyfriend, he loves the ring but the company shipped a size 13 vs the 11 I ordered. It's sort of a hassle to send it back because he is living in Korea at the moment...luckily the exchange can resize it  ) <end>
 B000Q8U58I  Love Breathes Music  Gold Vermeil G-Clef Pendant with Cubic Zirconia ||	  My Daughter loves it  My daughter searched all over the internet for one of these necklaces and she decided on this one. She couldn't be happier with it. So far so good it is a perfect size for her neck some of the ones we looked at were really small and some were rap star huge. If you or your child is musical like mine is this pendant would make a great gift. <end>
 B000Q8X0QW  Natural Divinity  Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish and CZ Leaf Motif Large Cross Pendant Necklace ||	  Love ths cross !!!  This cross is beautiful and detailed,it looks like something you would see in a very expensive jewelry store,I love the size of it,i like bigger crosses,i am very happy with it and wear it often and get many compliments on it. <end>
 B000Q8X0TE  Divine Style Just For You  Gold Vermeil Two Tone Detachable Cross with White Cubic Zirconia ||	  Absolutely gorgeous!!  I received this necklace for easter and it is absolutely gorgeous! I always mix gold and silver so this necklace is perfect for doing just that. So far it is just as shiny and polished as the day I got it, no stones loose or missing and no tarnishing. Definitely a wonderful buy. <end>  Beautiful Necklace  Comes in a cute black gift box with a bow. Also included was a tulle pouch to store the necklace in if desired. Perfect gift item! <end>
 B000Q90I02  Tressa Sterling Silver CZ Princess-Cut Stud Earring Set (3 Pair) ||	  Love 'em!  I love these earrings. I bought them some time ago and I still wear them. <end>  The large ones look cheap  The small one looks good but the medium, and especially the large look so cheap! Haven't worn them for that reason. I wish I didn't get them. <end>
 B000QA2IHC  Connoisseurs Jewelry Cleaner 8 fl oz (236 ml) ||	  Perfect  It's exactly what it was adversited. It's the same as you would buy in the store and it cleans my rings and diamond jewerly well. <end>  Works ok.  Not great, but ok. Some reviewers said it works on silver, but it really doesn't. The image also doesn't show that it's for gold and precious stones only. <end>  It's great with gold but no silver...  I bought this thinking it would work good with silver and gold but mostly gold... I like how it polishes my gold... <end>  It's okay  My wedding band didn't shine that much more but it's okay for 7 bucks. I'd say buy this if your looking for something extra. I would give this 2 stars if it cost more than 7 bucks, but it is packaged nicely and has themdipmand brush. But in terms of "wow" not really. <end>  Super  This product makes my wedding ring shine like no other cleaner has! Sparkles and shines like the day I received it!! <end>  Love It!  I love the price of this jewelery cleaner and I love that it's available for prime! It works great, even on my cz jewelry!The basket feature with the brush is nice, too - I have various-sized nose studs that I use my cleaner for, too. One of my smaller ones slipped through the basket but I was able to get it out of the bottom of the container easily with a pair of tweezers.Great price, great product and ease of use - I'm giving it 5 stars!! <end>  works great  Fiance says it works well. She said it really made her engagement ring shine and sparkle. Hopefully it saves me on having to take her ring to the jewelers to be polished. She said the included brush works well and has soft bristles. <end>  Seems to work well  Seemed to work well and leave my jewelry and gems shiny and clean, but I'm not sure if soap and water wouldn't have been any different. Also, it has a familiar smell... after some thought and sniffing I realized it smell like the liquid cleaner used in carpet shampoo systems. Wouldn't be surprised if its the same stuff. <end>  Convenient and effective  I love this stuff - I bought it to clean my engagement ring and it works fabulously! I clean my ring about 1x per month and I always get compliments. This works just as well on my fake CZ earrings as the real stuff. The basket and little brush really help bring out the shine. I use a dust free cloth to dry them off afterwards and it really helps keep things sparkly. Be careful though, the lid is not super tight. I spilled some in the car when I was bringing it home because I couldn't resist trying it at work where it was delivered. <end>  good product  product arrived on time. the 8oz jar is larger than I had purchased in stores. Still a great product and arrived on time. <end>  SImple and easy to use.Works great  I will definately buy this product again when it gets low. It made my jewelry sparkle again! It is also very easy to use. <end>  Damaged  Container was cracked and leaking upon arrival. I had to throw it out. Thank goodness it was in a separate plastic bag so my other purchases were not soaked. Not worth cost to return, so my loss. <end>  Easy to use and affordable  I kept forgetting to pick one of these up in the store so it was so easy to order and more affordable this way. <end>  Fast cleaner  The setting on my wedding ring gets dirty very quickly, and has a lot of little crevices. This product did a great job cleaning my ring quickly and beautifully! I also tried to use it on a pair of earrings which I thought were silver, but it turned them a yellowish brown color. It did the same thing to a metal (not silver) ring I had, too. That is the only reason this got a 4 star rating instead of 5 star. <end>  Ehh, it's okay  I bought this to clean my ring and while the actually stones are clean, it did nothing for the band of the ring, which was the part I wanted to clean. If you are looking to clean the stones/gems in your jewelry then buy this. If you are looking to clean the metal, look elsewhere. <end>  Was Not Impressed  I didn't think this worked any better than an ammonia solution and a tooth brush. I would not buy it again. <end>  Excellent jewelry cleaner  As long as you follow the directions (including not dunking some items which are too delicate), this is an outstanding, fast jewelry cleaner. <end>  Excellent+  This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product. I would recommend them without reservation. <end>  Looks GREAT immediately following a cleaning but...  But the cleaning only lasts about a week. It seems like there's some residue left behind that &#34;attracts&#34; dust/dirt. I definitely need to give my platinum/diamond ring a good polishing once a week with this. <end>  Gorgeous!  My rings look great! This got them nice and clean and even made the scuffs less noticeable. My diamonds are all sparkly and brilliant. The smell of the product was a nice soapy smell, not like chemicals, so I wasn't afraid to use it on my jewelry. <end>  Works great for cleaning gold!  I had to clean my class ring. This product really did bring out the sparkle in the diamonds and brighten the gold! <end>  Good Jewelry Cleaner...  This is a good jewelry cleaner for most jewelry and really makesthe items shine and sparkle. Just be sure to read and follow thedirections as this should not be used on certain types of jewelry.I clean my jewelry regularly, especially the things I wear everyday or very frequently. It really makes a difference.Just a hint  If cleaning jewelry near a sink, put the stopper inthe drain or cover the drain hole with a sponge or washcloth.When rinsing the jewelry, it's very easy for the small items toslip from your fingers and if the drain is open, goodbye.Dry jewelry thoroughly with a soft cloth before putting backinto your jewelry box. <end>  Works great for a quick clean  I used it as per instruction my ring came out clean. I used it for my earrings, it came out clean but still had you know those yucky gunk in it... and really had to use the brush included. I would buy this again - it only takes 30 secs to clean jewelry  -) <end>  Works well  This product works well on diamond jewelry (and also on CZ). It has a tray and a small brush inside the container where you can put the jewels to soak in. As others have mentioned, handling the tray can get messy, but you won't mind when you see the results. <end>  Great Product  After reading alot of reviews from other cleaners, I finally decided to purchase this one. It was the only one that had all 5 stars! It's a great cleaner and it brought my jewelery back to shiny, just the way I bought it! <end>  Awesome results!  I tested it out as soon as I opened the box. My ring looks like new again, the sparkle is unbelievable. I would strongly recommend getting this. Very pleased. <end>  Great product!  I love this product. I use it for my engagement and wedding rings to make them sparkle again. Makes a huge difference and they look as good as new. <end>  Don't Use on Silver  I have a silver chain that was tarnished. Putting it in this cleaner made it 100 percent worse. I used the brush and tried dipping two times, and it came out almost pure black. This product should state that it's not for use with silver. <end>  Cleaned it all up!  This worked really well for all my jewellery. Tried, gold, diamonds etc.... and all of them were sparkly clean - thanks <end>  Works extremely well!  This is pretty much my go-to jewelry cleaner. Comes with a mini brush that really allow me to get up in to all the groves of the ring, especially the diamond. Really brings the shine out!!! <end>  Cleans Great!!  We no longer have to take the time to go to a jewelry store for a cleaning. This stuff works fast, great and easy to use. <end>  Bling  I use this to clean my ring every week and it really does a great job. Keeps my ring clean and sparkly. I usually soak it in there while showering and when I get done getting ready, I take it out and use the small brush to clean the crevices. Works like a charm. <end>  Eh it's okay...  First thing - the brush that comes with this is so tiny it's pointless. Sorry but it just really didn't work for me. No I don't have giant hands, but the thing is tiny! I ended up using an old toothbrush which made a big difference!However, I don't think this works solution works that great. I left a pretty tarnished sterling silver bracelet for about 1 hour then scrubbed. Didn't see a big difference, so I chanced it and left over night. Scrubbed again, but didn't really make it look like new (like a lot of other review say). It worked better on a couple rings, but not on a necklace. I probably wouldn't buy again or recommend. <end>  Does the trick  There is nothing like getting your jewelry professionally cleaned, but for a quick clean to bring some sparkle back to your gems, this stuff does the trick. <end>  Very Effective Product  I just received the product today and tried it on my ring which is made of sterling silver with a white topaz. Before application, the white topaz appeared dull even though I tried all kinds of soap and brushing. And this cleaner delivered!! So glad it did, and the little brush that came with it really helped the process. Since other reviews have mentioned that the cleaner could possibly do damage to silver, I was very careful about not to dip the entire band into the jar, and from what I can tell it didn't tarnish the silver band at all. Maybe the key is not to throw the whole thing in there for too long. 5 mins worked for me. Overall a great product and can definitely last a long time. <end>  Works like a charm!  Works so great on my engagement ring! My sister-in-law even asked if I got my ring professionally cleaned after I used this cleaner 6 days prior! Highly recommended <end>  Didn't notice a difference.  I used this on various different materials and different stones, and none seemed any more brilliant afterwards. Perhaps my nicer jewelry (gold, precious stones) just weren't dirty enough? Don't bother for silver or costume jewelry. <end>  WORKS GREAT  SO SIMPLE AND IT DOES A GOOD JOB ON GOLD, SILVER AND DIAMONDS.I LOVE IT. LOVE GETTING IT ON LINE TOO. <end>  Love It  This is great jewelry cleaner. I was skeptical at first because it was so inexpensive, but this stuff is awesome. I clean my platinum with this, and it looks like it was professionally cleaned. I have been using this almost on a daily basis. It's quick, easy, and inexpensive...what more could you ask for? Great purchase. <end>  Quality jewelry cleaner  Cleans jewelry better than jewelry store brands tried in the past. Can leave in for few minutes or forget about them for hours and is always clean and hasn't damaged a piece yet. Plastic jewelry catcher/brush piece inside isn't quite weighted enough on the bottom, so can slightly float sideways without jewelry on it, causing you to fish it out a bit, but otherwise really like this product. <end>  No Mess Jewelry Cleaner!  Easy to use Jewelry Cleaner! No mess! It doesn't take a lot of time to make your jewelry shine! Great Product overall! <end>  Bling bling  My rings are now all nice and shiny and new looking! I've only used this a few times, and the only problem I had was that it was a little difficult to grab my ring back out of the tray when it was ready. That probably happens sometimes with any jewelry cleaner with a tray like this. <end>  Wow. Just wow.  I received this today and used it to clean my sapphire engagement ring that I've been wearing for a little less than 2 months. I was definitely starting to look dull and dingy, but this cleaned it right up in 30 seconds! Looks as good as new - the sparkle is back and the color looks great again! I would definitely recommend this product. I expect this jar to last me quite a while, but I will most likely purchase this again when I need to as well.I only wish I'd taken before and after pictures, because the difference is so striking! <end>  Shiny jewerly!  It cleaned my rings really nice! I cleaned my engagement ring as soon as I receive the cleaner and it was as shiny as when it was when I got it 2 years ago! <end>  Great stuff. Rinse well.  I bought this to use on my white sapphire engagement ring in a bezel setting, which tends to gunk up when I use hand lotion. I was skeptical, but the solution works really well! Quick and easy. Just be sure to rinse the solution off well. <end>  Great / cheap cleaner!  This cleaner works really well for everyday cleaning of jewelry. I've been using it for years and was excited to find it on Amazon. <end>  Best jewelry cleaner ever!  This is the best jewelry cleaner I have ever used. In just 30 seconds your gold & diamonds look as shiny and new as when you have them cleaned at the jewelry store. I will continue to use this for years to come! <end>  my wife likes it, good enough for me  this is a good product, this is a good price, I recommend this stuff for do it yourself at home jewelry cleaning! <end>  Love it!  This worked so well on my diamonds and gold jewelry. Really brings the shine back! I was hesitate and thought maybe I should take it to the jeweler, but for last minute touch up, this is great. Thank you. <end>  not for silver  i read some reviews that said this cleaner will clean silver. however, it doesn't!! if anything, the silver seems more golden after I cleaned it and still has a lot of tarnish. I will be purchasing a silver cleaner... <end>  Bada Bing, Bada Boom!  I was excited to receive my jewelry cleaner and it works just as it says it would. I used it on my diamonds, gold, and wedding band and they are shiny again just like on the day I first got them. So excited I will be using this item often. <end>  Perfect for wedding rings!  This is perfect for sparkling up my wedding ring! I have my husband's grandmother's engagement ring and a newer wedding ring, so the older gold tarnishes a lot quicker. Just 30 seconds in the bath (note of the side directions say to only leave in for 30 seconds) and it comes out sparkly! Great value. Also, this is for gold and precious gems ONLY! My husband threw some silver composite (ie. cheap) rings in hoping to clean off the tarnish, and it came out more tarnished than it went in. <end>  Great Cleaner  Leaves my jewelry shiny and clean. Easy to use with the plastic holder that you can use to dip jewelry into the cleaning formula. Would recommend, very satisfied <end>  works  i leave my earrings in there for a few hours take them out brush them off and put them on every time the shine goes away works great for the price. I'm using white gold on emeralds. <end>  great product, work like magic  my ring is even more sparkling than newly bought. This product works like amazing! Highly recommend this product to any one. You will never regret when buying it <end>  Works great  What a difference this made with my jewelry cleaning! I was quite surprised that it worked so well. It wasn't a waste of money and I became a cleaning fool looking for jewelry to clean. <end>  Easy to use, works great!  It is very easy to use and my jewlery comes out clean and sparkling. Definitely worth the price. It is nice knowing that before traveling or special events I can clean my jewlery at home instead of having to take it to a jewlers. <end>  Do not use on silver!!!  I have almost exclusively silver jewelry and I bought this to clean up older pieces that I haven't worn in ages. Unfortunately I only paid attention to the good reviews, some of which said this was fine for silver. This product is most certainly NOT FINE for silver. I left a Tiffany bracelet - nothing fancy, just a chain - in there for 3 days, and it came out almost black. I was shocked. I haven't worn it in a while so it's not a key piece but I am very disappointed and frankly surprised that a cleaner that would work so well on gold and diamonds would ruin silver jewelry. I will be requesting a refund. <end>  Not for sterling silver  I stupidly put my most favorite sterling silver necklace and earrings in the Connoisseurs Revitalizing Jewelry Cleaner overnight. When I took them out the next morning, they were all tarnished. Hopefully some silver cleaner will restore them to their originial luster; but, if not, I'll never be able to wear my favorite jewelry again and they are irreplaceable. <end>  Grime eliminator in a matter of minutes  This cleaner is great for bringing expensive gems and costume jewelry to a high shine. I use it to clean everything from the silver and gold watch band of my Rolex to fake diamond/fake gold earrings I got on clearance at the mall. I've also used it on real diamonds and they come out looking like new. The key to getting your jewelry to sparkle is to use the brush that comes with the kit. If you don't brush then your jewels won't achieve their full luster. The cleaner has a tray inside which prevents you from having to try to fish out your jewelry from the bottom. After you let your jewelry soak for a few minutes, brush your pieces, run them under tap water and dry them on a soft towel. I've had my cleaner for about 5 years and it still works like new. Also, if your worried that the cleaner will damage your jewelry, you shouldn't be. I left a David Yurman necklace in the cleaner for several months (yes, months) on accident, and the necklace looked better than new when I pulled it out. <end>  Love this stuff!  Makes my White Gold Tacori engagement noticeably clean and shiny! I always get compliments on my ring right after it's been cleaned with this product. The little brush is great for cleaning all of the crevices, and the diamond looks like it's been professionally cleaned! I will definitely be buying this product again. <end>  Great product.  If you have diamond jewerly you need this product. It works great. I use it once or twice a week to shine up my diamond ring. <end>  Solid Jewelry Cleaner  This is a really good cleaner for the price. My one issue with it is that when I clean my engagement ring and then rinse with lukewarm water, it doesn't look as clean and bright until a few hand washes afterwards. So, don't be concerned if when you pull it out of the solution it doesn't blow your socks off, it will in a few washes! <end>  Doesn't seem to clean silver!  I read reviews that claims this product will clean silver- it does not! I hate to waste my money based on poor reviews. <end>  great jewelry cleaner  This cleaner works well on jewelry with a lot of diamonds close together. It does a great job dissolving the dirt out of the small spaces you can't really clean. The gold also comes out looking shiny. <end>  Like New!  I have only used this on white gold + diamonds, but I love this cleaner. Everything looks like it has just been polished and the cage lifts it right out. I also think the brush is small enough to reach little details in a ring (I have inset diamonds, for example, and it gets in the crevices between the stones and the setting). <end>  Very nice product  I just got this product and you would think I just received a new toy. I started cleaning all my jewelry. Love the little brush inside of the solution. You can really get a good cleaning with the brush provided. My jewelry came out sparkling. I love this product and the price couldn't be beat. <end>  Great for your priceless jewelry  I have used Connoisseurs Jewlery Cleaner for many years. My jeweler sells it in her shop and highly recommended so naturally if they recommend I know it is great since we do trust her. But to have great looking jewelry you must remember to clean it often and follow directions. <end>  Best At-home Jewelry Cleaner  This is by far the best at-home jewelry cleaner, at a great cost. Nothing compares to the expensive sonic machines that jewelry stores have, but this is pretty impressive. I use it on my engagement ring regularly and am very pleased with it. Definitely recommended! <end>  Don't waste your $  I thought I would purchase this thinking it would be like having it cleaned from a professional....wrong! Liquid soap, warm water using a child's toothbrush does so much better (what I normally use). The solution actually made my diamond cloudy. I had to reclean with my normal method to get it sparkly again. <end>  Don't use with Silver AND Gold jewelry  This product works well on silver jewelry (make sure to use the brush!) but DO NOT use it on jewelry that has both silver and gold. This may be common knowledge but I was unaware. Luckily this is reversible. I contacted the company to see if there was a way to fix the situation and they were very responsive (wrote back within 24 hours) and even sent me one of their cleaning cloths for free. By the way the silver cleaning cloth by Connoisseurs worked like a dream! Anyway to summarize  great company, good product, not for use on jewelry with silver and gold metals. <end>  WOO! It works!  This stuff rocks. I received a beautiful engagement ring just about a month ago, 3 stones in the middle, several channel set princess cuts on either side - in other words, lots of stones shoved close together. I have never had a diamond ring before, I was shocked how fast they lost their shiny luster and it got pretty dull pretty fast. We paid a lot of money for this thing, I wanted to take care of it and for my precious baby to sparkle! So I read some reviews and even saw that this is the brand they sell in the jewelry store where we bought this ring.I dunked my ring in there just moments after receiving it, scrubbed a little with the included brush and rinsed it clean. Holy moly I was blinded by the sparkle! It simply amazes me how much of a difference it made with a not very old piece of jewelry. I love it! I will use it weekly, if not more to keep it clean and sparkly. I'm sure it doesn't replace a real jeweler's cleaning, but it's a great stop gap in between. The basket is great, easy to hold. The brush is really kinda useless, I'll likely just use a toothbrush, but other than that, it works just great. <end>  Jewelry Cleaner.  Dipped every piece of jewelry I own. All of it looks great. Impressed. Been looking for a while for something like this. Would recommend to anyone. <end>  Great Product  Received on time..Does a great job! use it once so far but i would definately purchase this product again.. <end>  Ok product!  First off I gave 4 stars because the product is overall a good buy at the price. The inside cleaning area that you can remove doesn't fit that great inside so it will float on its side a bit and you have to dig it out instead of being able to pull it right out. The cleaner seems to work well on my ring and other jewelry and at this price I guess having the inside tip isn't too bad of a deal ; ) <end>  Clean my bling  This is a great jewelry cleaner. I used it on my new jewelry as well as my antique items and they are all brilliant. This is great stuff. <end>  Meh...  Works pretty well on already decently clean silver. I tried to clean a REALLY old, tarnished sterling ring with this, but it didn't do anything. The ring may be ruined, I'm not sure, but it doesn't seem to be good for deep cleaning or making that old piece of jewelry look new again. May be better to get an old fashioned silver cloth. <end>  Great quality, great price  I used it to clean my sterling silver jewelry and gold jewelry all having gem stones and was pleased with the results. Price at the time was very good with good reviews as well. <end>  Great cleaner..  This is a great jewelry cleaner and my rings always come out looking so sparkly and clean. I often leave them in the solution while I am in the shower and they always come out looking better than before. The cleaner comes with a brush to help you get under your stone so it really shines. <end>
 B000QCK7IM  Tremendously Bold and Beautiful  Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish with White and Black Cubic Zirconia Large Cross Pendant Necklace ||	  Absolutely Beautiful!!!!!  This cross is perfect in every way. I love the size. The black and white stones really glitter. The inside black cross revolves. I have certainly received compliments on it. It is very unusual. I wear it casual and for dressier events as well.Annette - Texas <end>
 B000QCKAA2  Leather Necklace - 18 Inch Long 2.0mm Diameter Natural Brown Leather Cord Necklace w/Sterling Silver Clasp ||	  leather choaker  the only thing i don't like is the plastic finish. it won't get the patina of natural leather. some people may like that. it's very well made. <end>
 B000QCL2RW  1928 Jewelry Silver-Tone Crystal Teardrop Necklace ||	  Wife loves it!  I am glad I bought this for my wife on our anniversary. It's now one of her favorite necklace. I do suggest getting the matching pair of earrings.Overall good quality & excellent looks! <end>  Wedding  This necklace along with the matching earrings were perfect for my wedding day look. It was classic and elegant and looks great in photos as well as up close. I personally feel that the necklace looks better in person than it even does online and the adjustable length was great so that people of different shapes/sizes can put it on and have it lay perfectly! I am extremely happy with this purchase and only wish I had somewhere else to wear the set! (Maybe for our anniversary!!) I was also very happy with the cost! The set was half that of bridal stores!! <end>  The Cherry On Top  This was the perfect accessory for my dress, I absolutely love the way it brings something beautiful and classic to a modern day look without seeming too themed. Honestly there is a lot this necklace (and matching earrings) can be worn with and the level of detail in their intricacy and the romantic design take a wardrobe selection from pretty to awe-striking! <end>  Gorgeous, not the sturdiest  Pros  Looks more expensive than it is, has a great vintage style, sits well around the neck, is easily adjustable.Cons  Is exactly as durable as you'd expect for the price.This necklace made it through my wedding day (and looked great), but some of the rhinestones came out during the reception. I was trying not to spend hundreds of dollars on my wedding jewelry, and this was the perfect solution. I would recommend this if you just need it for a special event, but I don't think you can wear it again and again. <end>  Perfect for my wedding day  I tried on a ton of necklaces to wear on my wedding day. This one was absolutely perfect. It has that vintage glam look that I was looking for, and it matched my dress perfectly. I loved it! I didn't like the earrings as much, but mostly because they're not what I'm used to. I did wear them for my wedding to match the necklace though.The necklace is pretty fancy, and I'm not sure if I'll wear it very often...but it was great for my wedding  ) <end>  Perfect!  This necklace is absolutely perfect for my wedding. I didn't have much money to spend so I wanted to get something that looked expensive yet didn't break the bank. It gives a nice old fashioned look with a modern flare. Also, it's the perfect size for what I wanted. <end>  Very nice!  I bought this necklace to wear at my wedding and I think it's going to be perfect! I bought it with the matching earrings and I am very happy! I cant wait to see how it looks with my dress. I had a hard time finding the jewelry that I liked, plus was not way expensive or cheaply made. This was definitely the right buy! <end>  Breathtaking!  I bought this necklace as a finishing piece to my ball ensemble and it's breathtaking! I love this necklace! <end>  Very beautiful!  This Necklace was bought so I can wear on my wedding day. It was delievered fast and in a beautiful box. It looks beautiful on me. I am so excited to wear it on my Big day. I wish It were real Silver so that I may be able to use it as a family heirloom. But for the price and the qulaity it has been well worth it. <end>  WOW  This necklace looks so elegant! definitly worth the money!! looks so real!! Looks great with my wedding dress and tiara! <end>  Bridal necklace  Very happy! Great sparkle and detail on the front, back, and chain. The length is adjustable which is handy. Looks spectacular with the matching earrings. <end>  Love this!  We bought these for my daughters wedding. They looked so natalgic on her. It completed the outfit. So classy!  D <end>  Crystal necklace  My daughter wore this with the matching earrings on her wedding day. They looked great! <end>  Beautiful in Person & Perfect for My Wedding  I DESPERATELY needed a necklace for my wedding and had been looking for WEEKS with no luck. Finally I decided to try and order one online &#8211; I preferred to buy one in person in case I didn&#8217;t like it I didn&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of sending it back for a refund.Anywho, so I was looking for something dainty and simple with enough of a diamond accent to look good in my pictures &#8211; this was the PERFECT necklace. It was absolutely beautiful in person. The only issue I had with it was the top part of the diamond accent would twist around a little so my Maid of Honor was constantly fixing it for pictures. None-the-less, I wouldn&#8217;t have traded this necklace for another &#8211; It was perfect. <end>  just like it appears  I bought this necklace for my wedding, and it's perfect match! I do wish the chain was better quality, but it will do the job! <end>  beautiful!!!!!  I bought these for my wedding along with the matching earrings. They are absolutely amazing! they look very fancy. I really love them, and can't wait to wear them!! <end>  1928 necklace  This necklace is absolutely beautiful! I was hesitant to buy one online for my wedding but it matches my gown perfectly. I love it! <end>  Better than expected  I'm so glad I took a chance to order this & the matching earrings online rather than look for something in a store. They are absolutely stunning, better even in person than pictured, and I love them. They will look perfect for my son's wedding. And the price was so reasonable. I so badly want to order the matching bracelet but it is so much more expensive, I just can't, with all the other wedding costs. So I'll just be happy with what I have. <end>  Elegant and Timeless  Bridal Crystal Fancy Drop Earrings1928 Bridal Crystal Fantasy BraceletThese were the bridal jewelry of my now wife, and they look awesome together. We wish they were a set. We definitely love our purchase! <end>  Perfect!  I was nervous about purchasing this to go with wedding stuff as it didn't specify what metal it was made of and I'm allergic to nickle. I wore it for about 4 hours straight when it first arrived to test it (figuring that would leave me plenty of time to get any reaction/rash to go away before the big day if I needed to.) It looked great and I had no reaction. So whatever it is made of, it doesn't include nickle on parts that contact the skin at least. Great purchase! <end>  Elegant and sparkly  I purchased this necklace for my daughter to wear on her wedding day. We looked at all the high-end jewelery stores and never found anything that was unique. I found this necklace and it is perfect. My daughter loves it. <end>  Beautiful!  It took me a ton of searching to find a necklace that I would want to wear for my wedding. I'm so glad I found this one. It's more beautiful in person than it is in the picture. Can't wait to wear this on the big day. Gorgeous! <end>  a great buy  I bought this recently and love it! The chain is a bit shorter then expected but with the extender it fits just fine although closer to your neck but if that really bothers you can always add more chain to make it longer with a quick visit to the craft store.When I first got it I was worried it wasn't sparkly enough and it stuck me as cheap but after looking at it longer I could see it wasn't cheap and wasn't expensive but a nice in between. The crystals sparkle alot more on your neck then in your hand and its just enough bling without being too showy. I am really happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone <end>
 B000QCL2TU  1928 Jewelry Keepsake Lockets Charms Vintage-Inspired Look Necklace ||	  Not worth almost $40 bucks  It is a very pretty locket, but for 38 bucks, I was expecting it to feel a little more sturdy. It's really just costume jewelry. It feels cheap. When the charms of the necklace hit each other, it sounds like plastic or really thin metal. To be honest, I have seen $12 necklaces like this at Charming Charlie's or Claire's. I hate writing unfavorable reviews, but shoppers should know what they are getting. <end>  locket  It was the right size. Am glad I could take the extra charms off as they cling outloud. I like the shape, there is plenty of room for pictures. <end>  Simply beautiful  I bought this like a year ago and still looks new, I love it and wear it every chance I get. Looks rally good and I have received a lot of complements. <end>  Glitzy  This is really cute in person. Nice and heavy, but do not buy if you are looking for something super-antique-like. It is very polished and silvery. Makes a jingle noise when you wear it because the little charms bounce around, but I like that. The locket will hold a picture, but I haven't attempted it yet. Overall, I really like this necklace. <end>  Disappointed  1928 Jewelry usually has an aged look it. This piece is very shiny and looks cheap. I gave it to my 6 yr old to play with. <end>
 B000QCL402  Tzarina Simulated White Pearl Chandelier Earrings ||	  beautiful earrings  Beautiful earrings, you can wear them with everything, they are just gorgeous! Pearls and brilliants combine perfectly well and illuminates the whole face. The only but is that, after a while, they are a little uncomfortable. And it is not a problem of weight, because they are very light. Perhaps it is the closure system. Anyway, they are fantastic! <end>
 B000QCN7J8  Bridal Simulated Pearl Crystal Snowflake Pendant Necklace ||	  Stunning...but  This necklace is beautiful. Well, the pendent is anyway. The pearls really distract from the sparkle of the snowflake. In fact, I plan on removing the snowflake and putting it on a black choker, that way the crystals will really shine. <end>
 B000QCP4G2  Antique Style Sterling Silver Filigree .65ct Amethyst Ring ||	  Amazing!  I am so happy I bought this ring! This company makes a beautiful product. I will definitely buy from them again! The ring is perfect!  D  D  D <end>  She can't stop staring at it!  Bought this as a two year anniversary present for my girlfriend. Arrived within a week of ordering (she is a size 7). She absolutely loved it! She wears it everyday, and two months later I still catch her staring at it. She has shown it to everyone, and they all agree it is gorgeous. It looks a lot more delicate on her finger than on the picture, but that makes her love it even more. The details on it are amazing. Well worth it, so if you are thinking about it, don't hesitate, I'm sure you will love it as much as she does.She uploaded some pictures, so you can see how nice it is from all angles. <end>  Very nice ring  The ring took a little longer to arrive than the other ones I ordered from Amazon, however the seller kept me posted as to when it would be coming, and what the holdup was. I am very pleased with the look and fit of my new ring! <end>  gorgeous ring  the ring is more lovely in person than the photograph and I am always getting compliments on it. It is very pretty and I am really pleased with this purchase <end>  spectacular  I love this ring. I think it is the most beautiful one I've ever seen. It is my engagement ring and I am so excited to wear it for the rest of my life. I could not have created this any better myself. The quality is wonderful. Everyone I've shown loves this ring. I wanted something unique and that would remind me of my grandma. This definitely fits the bill! I have a matching wedding band from the same seller and it is the same wonderful quality. Thank you so much! <end>  gorgeous antique-style ring  I love this ring! My boyfriend got it for me for Christmas this year, and it is exactly my style. The ring is very delicate looking (much smaller than it looks in the photo) and the gem inside is very sparkly. I love the antique style sterling silver setting, it is perfect for vintage jewelry lovers. <end>  Beautiful; exactly as advertised  I love this dainty little ring for my petite hand. The stone is gorgeous and the small, antique band is very unique. I highly recommend sizing your finger yourself and then double checking with a jeweler to reduce the chances of having to send it back. It took several weeks to receive the ring but that was stated in the description, as they are custom cast by order.Very satisfied and will purchase from this seller again.  ) <end>  Really small  I normally wear a size 6 and I can't even get this ring on my little finger. The band is very thin. Was disappointed in this purchase. <end>  Its pretty!  Its so pretty, my girlfriend loves it. The inset gem is perfect for anyone who uses their hands at work, she sews clothing. Totally Boss! <end>
 B000QCPEIA  Jeweled Cross Collection Hematite Tone Crystal Long Necklace ||	  Not as nice as the photograph  As sometimes happens, this cross appears to be much nicer than it is in reality when it arrives. It is quite flat and does not look as good as the photo. The chain is quite nice. Rather a disappointment. <end>
 B000QCPOW6  Sterling Silver Open Filigree Ring, Size 5 ||	  shiny ring  The make of the ring is fine but the finish on the ring is too shiny. It looks and feels like shiny plastic. I don't know why it is different than other silver rings I have bought from Amazon. I have bought earrings here also that had the super shiny finish. In my opinion, the shiny finish makes the items look like they aren't really silver. <end>  Simple elegance  I love this ring. I tend to like simple rings that are not overwhelmingly big. While a little bit bigger than some of my rings, the size is just right for the design. I actually wear it quite often as it looks good with both casual and dressy things. <end>  Beautiful Ring  This ring was beautiful and it looked much more expensive that it was. I gave it as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. <end>
 B000QCYATE  Large Round Blue CZ Ring (size  8) ||	  Unless you're Elton John ... forget it  I purchased this for my wife as a joke and it was a complete success. She's worn it to a couple of costume parties and gotten some great laughs. For this it's actually 5 stars. <end>
 B000QD22XO  Boma Green Turquoise & Abalone Ring (size  6) ||	  this ring is gorgeous  and unique, just like my bff. i got this for her bday and she loved it! arrived on time as well. <end>
 B000QDBJOC  Titanium Cross Pendant with Black Rubber Cord, 18IN ||	  I never take it off  This pendant is striking when you get it in your hand. I have received many compliments on it.I would recommend buying a chain at the same time though. The necklace it comes with has a magnetic clasp which I wouldn't recommend. I almost lost my cross a couple times because my clasp came open without my knowing. Now that I have a new silver chain I never take it off. <end>
 B000QDI6NO  7mm Manhattan-n Titanium Necklace, 18IN ||	  Nice big chain.  Item is REALLY nice piece. Craftsmanship is spot on. The seller is awesome to deal with. Be aware though, what you see is what you get. I was originally looking for a set piece to go with a titanium bracelet/watch but while this is made OF titanium the color is SILVER. Other than that it's a big chain with that big chain look but without the big chain weight. I highly recommend this product. <end>  titanium necklace  This necklace was for my adult son and he has been very happy with it. <end>
 B000QDU3GC  Dazzling Hearts  Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish and Cubic Zirconia Designer Inspired Interlocked Hearts Brooch ||	  Beautiful!  Purchased this pin as a Christmas present. Wasn't too sure how it would look, or the size of it, but was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED when it arrived -- it's absolutely beautiful!! The gift recipient loved it too, and she wears it all the time! Would definitely buy again! Thank you!! <end>
 B000QDYI0Y  Amazon.com  HAWAIIAN HONU TURTLE PETROGLYPH BLACK LEATHER &amp; HEMP BRACELET  Clothing ||	  Turtle Hemp Bracelet  I got one of these bracelet for a friend and myself. We were both pleased at how nice the bracelet looks. I have got many compliments on the bracelet and a few pwople from Hawaii asked if I got it there. It fits well and adjusts. Don't get it wet it can twist some. Over all I am very pleased with look and comfort. <end>  Disappointed  the strings on the sides of the bracelet that tie the turtle in place kept sliding to the sides. And it wasnt easy to adjust. I ended up taking the turtle off, going to the store and buying the necessary supplies to make my own leather hemp bracelet and put the turtle on that. Got to say, my bracelets are A LOT better! Also, the little beads that came on the ends of the adjustable strings fell off! This exact thing happened with a different turtle bracelet i bought here for my boyfriend! <end>
 B000QEEPA6  Sterling Silver High Polished Finish Cute Plain 3mm Band Ring Size 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ||	  Not what it looks like.  I'm not completely happy with this ring. Although it is a great size and mm width and it's flat band, it appears darker in the photo, which is why I bought it. But when it arrived, it is so shiny and white colored, it looks like it's plastic. Like it's from a quarter machine at K-Mart.Oh well, I guess I'll keep it as a back up in case the ring that I am really in love with now gets lost. A black band ring made of Stainless Steel; Surgical Grade 316L. It rocks. <end>  Gorgeous  The ring is just as advertised. Very shiny and sturdy pure 925 silver. I love it and it is a staple of my ring collection. Would recommend ring and seller to all. Thank you for the beautiful product! <end>
 B000QF7NFY  Sterling Silver Multi-Gemstone Ring, Size 8 ||	  ups and downs  This ring was very pretty and a great deal, but one of the side stones has fallen out already. I've had the ring about a month and never wore it around the house. It was pretty enough that I'm considering ordering another one, though! <end>  Very nice for the money  This is a very cute ring, and well worth the money. It wasn't the most beautiful ring I have ever seen, but I do like it and it is very pretty. For the money spent I have no regrets. <end>  Sterling Silver Multi-Gemstone Ring  Very pretty. The stones have a lot of clarity, and the garnet is an especially pretty red color. A good deal for the price. <end>  Ok for the money  I purchased this ring at a discounted price in my Quick Picks. Best thing I can say is that I didn't spend a lot of money on it. I mean, yes, it's silver. The middles stone (garnet) is pretty nice. But the side stones are really pale in color. From a distance, it almost looks like they are missing. Very dull and lack luster. Would make a nice gift for a child, but don't spend over $15 or so for it or you may be disappointed. <end>  Just beautiful..  This has become one of my favorite rings; the colors are just as they are pictured. I love multi-gemstone jewelry; I wear it often and I get so many compliments on this! <end>  Disappointed in the amethyst & silver  The garnet is a nice color but the amethyst are very pale, nearly clear. All other characteristics are nice.After 2months the "silver" has flaked off to an underlaying dull gray metal. <end>
 B000QFL1B6  Abalone Shell Silver Cufflinks with Gift Box ||	  A good match  I bought these because they match a specific tie, and because I'm a big fan of abalone/mother of pearl... not as versatile as some of the other cufflinks I've gotten here <end>
 B000QFLAD0  Amazon.com  C184 Tie Bar - Center Box  Clothing ||	  Tie Bar  I recieved this tie bar in three days! Very fast service. Unfortunately I did not realize that "with removable tie bar chain" meant they would remove it when I bought it. While the tie bar itself is very nice, I bought it as a gift and he really wanted a bar with a chain. Thank you for the speedy service. <end>
 B000QU45LO  10mm Manhattan-b Titanium Bracelet ||	  great bracelet  got this bracelet earlier than delivery date. great bracelet. slightly longer for my wrist but manage to shorten it little bit. i am wearing it everyday <end>  VERY CHEAP "plastic"?  Got this in the mail the other day, and as it is a gift for my fiance' for Valentine's day, it has not yet been worn. I can tell you it is VERY LIGHTWEIGHT, almost seeming TO BE VERY CHEAPLY MADE PLASTIC. Not sure if I will even give it to him actually. It IS NOT worth the price as it feels to the touch and in weight to be a CRAPPY bubble gum machine tow. That was a surprise. I tried it on my own wrist ( I am a 5'7 150 lb woman) and while it is a little big on me , of course, I think it MAY actually fit my guy just fine without any adjustments. Will see. But it's not overly large ( in wrist size, as I saw a reviewer describe. That reviewer was probably a very thin guy. We are athletic and larger people, but not fat by any means. Describing it by my/our sizes.)I will not buy anymore titanium from this seller, only because I think their so-called titanium is a garbage fake copy. I have my doubts about the metal used. But I don't think I will return it. I just feel like I should now buy something now that's actually nice to throw in with the Valentine's gift. Seems this bracelet should be around 20 bucks. It's not. It is very shiny in tone, though, and somewhat of an eye catcher , until you touch it. Kindof embarassing. Hope it doesn't break after he's worn it for a couple days. Feels exactly like cheap plastic. Can't say without having it reviewed by a jeweler. Too embarassed to take it into a jeweler. Lol. Oh well.P.s . UPDATE  Decided to give this thing unwrapped to Dan early and not even excuse it on Valentine's day. He tried not to laugh, but was gracious ( and it's way big on him too).He HAS titanium and agrees THIS IS NOT. Couldn't be. <end>  Better than expected  I just received the bracelet today, but I must say that it looks very expensive. Overall I am very satisfied with the bracelet itself, although I cannot say how well it will wear over time as far as how easily it shows any scratches or scrapes. I believe this item to be of the highest quality so I can only speak for myself as far as the overall value that it offers. The only other thing is that it does feel slightly heavier than a true titanium item might weigh, but I am by no means complaining , but as I said earlier it looks very nice for the price that you pay and the fit and finish appear to be top notch. I would definitely recommend this item. THIS BABY LOOKS VERY SEXY!!! <end>
 B000QY9LQ4  Multi Faceted 7mm Comfort Fit Mens Tungsten Carbide Wedding Band Ring Size 10 ||	  Tired of scratches  I researched different ring ingredients. Tungsten consistently came to the top for durability and shine. The ring has to be cast to size. It can only be scratched with a diamond. Engraving is a highly specialized technique. Although not available in a gold color, it lives up to the quality standards one asks for in a wedding band. I am a hands-on kind of guy. My gold ring suffered more weather than I asked. I am very pleased with this product and recommend it to others. The multi-facets of my ring sparkle like stones and has caught the attention of many since I put it on. <end>  great gift..  I loved everything about this ring..unique design, comfortable, nice weight. I received it on X-mas eve and wasn't expecting to receive it in time for the holiday..bonus. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the sizing, it runs a little large. My overall experience with this company was excellent. <end>  men's ring  My husband loved it....and because of the facets, people always comment on it because it adds a shine as if the ring has many stone or diamonds and it doesn't. <end>  Tungsten Carbide Ring  This is the second such ring purchased from this vendor through Amazon.com, and I can safely say that I am more than pleased with both the product and the service! Shipping was extremely fast, even here to Canada. The ring is of exceptional quality, and sells for $400 in a jewelry store (Amazon.com price of $29.95). You just can't beat something like that! <end>
 B000QYD29G  Rounded Edge 8mm Comfort Fit Mens Tungsten Carbide Wedding Band Ring Size 9 ||	  Attractive, solid piece  Really nice, amazing bargain. It's attractive, just as much or more than the picture depicts. Chunky but not overly so. <end>  Great Value!  We are so happy with this ring! Great value and looks amazing. I can't wait to put it on his finger on wedding day!! <end>  Awsome Ring  I couldn't be happier. I bought this ring as a backup. I have a solid white Paladium band. I was told when I bought it that it was more resistant to scratching than gold, but less resistant than platinum. I work in an office and i would scratch the paladium in a matter of 2 or 3 days. So, I purchased this ring for everyday wear. It is FANTASTIC! I can't scratch it if I try. I usually wear a 9.5. I ordered a 9.5 from another vendor and it was way to big. I ordered a 9 this time and it fit. i would suggest getting a half size smaller than you usally wear. <end>  Very nice!  This ring is beautiful  solid, sleek and comfortable. It is surprisingly heavy, heavier than gold, feels more like a platinum ring would feel. It looks exactly like it did in the pictures. Shockingly fast shipping  we received it sooner than I ever would have expected! (maybe 2 business days?) Overall, I highly recommend this product and this seller! <end>  Great ring, quick delivery  This ring is even better than I expected. Seeing it in person, it has a cool look, with an almost gun-metal gray color and it has a SOLID, heavy feel (more so then my white gold ring of the same size). My wife loves it and so do I. Great ring for a great price. <end>  Great ring  This ring is very smooth and comfortable to wear- my boyfriend wears it every day. Also, the metal is heavy enough that you don't worry about damaging it. <end>  very fast  item came extremely quickly. though it was a men's wedding band in a fuschia box with purple ribbon. what do you want for 40 bucks though, worth it! <end>  Tungsten Ring  The ring fits perfectly. I love how durable this ring is. I even tried scratching it with my key and it didn't even make a mark. Very comfortable fit and shiny too. <end>  Fantastic ring  This is one sharp looking ring and the quality is outstanding! Well worth the very low price. <end>  Good product  My husband lost his wedding band because he was losing weight so I bought this since I knew he'd be losing even more weight and we'd probably be replacing this ring also. He loved it and it was great up until he lost more weight, it got loose, and he forgot to leave it at home when we went to the beach. <end>  Great ring at a great price...  I just ordered this ring on Sunday night and it arrived Wednesday... Very fast shipping. The ring itself is gorgeous... even better than in the picture. I had my finger measured and the lady told me to order a 9 1/2. After reading some reviews I saw that these comfort-fit rings run a little big so I ordered a 9 and it fits perfect. The ring comes in a very nice little black box with a black ribbon and bow (doesn't look girly at all). Very nice product, fast shipping and nice packaging... what else could you ask for?Before I bought this ring I looked at some other styles. The local jewelry store had a tunsten/carbon-fiber ring on display that was very nice and cost $300.00. I got home and looked online. I found similar rings for about $100.00 but I read that the carbon-fiber an scratch easily. I found this solid tungsten ring instead for a lot cheaper. In the end, I like the look better and it was a lot cheaper. Definitely recommend this ring to others. <end>  Great Ring!!!  To get to the point, the ring is beautiful! Every other review says the same thing, so im just going to throw my two cents in. Shipping was 3 days(i live in FL), ring looks even better and more polished than the picture, great price, and mine came in a little black box. Listen to the warning about getting it smaller. My ring size is a 9 1/4 standard ring, a size 9 in a comfort fit 8mm ring (which is the size I bought), and after wearing it for a week now it fits perfectly. The ring looks amazing, and looks ALOT more expensive than what it is. Great buy, and a great looking ring!! <end>
 B000R7X62U  Miss Sixty "Romantic" Collection Charm Bracelet ||	  Charm Bracelet  I ordered the bracelet for my daughter's birthday gift. She loves it. I haven't seem it yet. I'm in Afghistan. <end>
 B000RIL82E  New Two Tone Polished Finish 4mm Magnetic Toerings ||	  disappointed  This ring is adjustable, however it still does not fit well at all. It is rather large so to make it fit on most women's toes (unless they're really big) you have to squeeze it down alot. The two ends have to cross to get small enough then it's just too uncomfortable to wear. I'm at least glad it was 1/2 off & it still isn't worth that much. I don't even wear it. <end>
 B000RS0960  Rhodium plated and enamel 5 speed gear knob lever cufflinks with a highly polished finish ||	  fun cufflinks  These are nicely polished which I preferred over the satin finish of some that I found. A little larger than you might expect, but nice cufflinks. I think the size is about the same as a penny. I was expecting closer to a dime. Still like them. <end>
 B000S76QX0  Classic Woven Silver Knot Cufflink and Stud Set with Gift Box ||	  Very cheap and heavy!  I own couple of love knot studs and seen many, but I've never seen such a poor quality ones! those are huge! very very heavy and cheaply made! the grooves are painted carelessly with black paint to enhance the looks and give a false feeling of void, but it's actually a colored block of solid steel. I highly recommend going for the classic ones (plain) they look much classier, smaller and lighter. <end>
 B000SQO3IG  Kit Heath Large Celtic Blue Topaz Necklace ||	  Not that blue  She really liked the pendant, the only problem is, the picture shows the stone to have more color that it actually does. The stone in the necklace I received was much paler than the one in the picture...I guess that's what I get for buying it online. Can't see exactly what you are going to get. <end>  Pretty but light in color and weight  This item is very pretty and it is identical to the picture. However the color of the stone is very pale and the item itself is lightweight. Does not feel worth the cost of the item. But I do like the design and hope that it holds up well because it is very attractive. <end>
 B000TA3JQI  Murano Glass Millefiori Red 10mm Round Earrings ||	  Beautiful Earrings  These are beautiful earrings. I bought many of these Millefiori Earrings in different colors and they are all very well hand crafted and gorgeous. <end>
