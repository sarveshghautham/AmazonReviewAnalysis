 B00007FCLA  PalmBeach Jewelry 10.75 TCW Emerald-Cut Genuine Smoky Quartz 14k Gold-Plated Ring ||	  Wow, I have never seen anything prettier  I just love the smokey quartz. Please give me more. <end>  Now exactly delicate  The gem wasn't as dark as I had hoped for but it was still a pretty stone. I guess my gage of the size wasn't correct but it was a pretty giant rock when it arrived. My issue with it was the setting. While I knew it was a roped band, I wasn't expecting it to be so wide and so huge... it looked really massive (and unattractive on my finger).This is not a ring for delicate fingers. I liked it but had to return it since it didn't go well with my hand... <end>  A beautiful addition to my daytime jewelry collection  Not long ago, a friend gave me a smoky topaz brooch. After receiving many compliments I decided to look for some pieces to give myself a complete set. When I found this emerald cut ring I thought it would be the perfect addition. I also ordered matching earrings14k Yellow Gold 7x5mm Emerald Cut Smoky Quartz Stud Earrings.The ring is perfect and the sizing is correct. It goes equally well with my winter and summer wardrobes. The size makes it perfect for daytime/work wear as it is big enough for notice without being too flashy. Since the color is not too dark, it can be worn well with a variety of colors and styles of clothing. I have been very happy with it and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile piece. <end>  Loved it!  This ring reminded me of my mother's ring she used to own when I was a child. It is a beautiful stone, perfect for my large hands! Definitely recommend this purchase if you like 'em big & beautiful! <end>  Did not like this ring  Did not like the way this ring looked. Does not look like what you see on line. It looks like a ring i would buy in a 25 cent candy machine. I wasnt expecting too much because of the price,but it just look too cheap. <end>  I love this ring  I get so many compliments on this ring, looks great on and I can wear it with so many outfits! Excellent buy! <end>  Emerald Cut Genuine Smoky Quartz 14K gold raring  The ring is everything it was described as and more.the stone is just the right size for my hand size. Have had many compliments on the ring and it goes perfect with the necklace I have of the same stone <end>  Beautiful Ring  It is a beautiful ring. I would love to have it in 14k gold if I can find it. This ring could be worn with anything. <end>  Surprise.  Not what I expected. The stone is more on brown than actually a smokey color. The gold color of the ring is a bit gaudy. Would not have ordered it if the description was closer to reality. <end>  not happy with the ring  the stone on the ring is really pretty and big which i like because I have big hands, but the gold-plating is way to bright and yellowish. the gold plate looks so fake. I have the earrings of this same stone and they are beautiful and the gold looks so real. Not happy with this ring at all. Also when I ordered it, I never received a receipt with it, so I can't return it. <end>  Good value for the money  The ring was exactly as advertised. My wife enjoys wearing the ring, so everyone is happy! <end>
 B00007FFI0  PalmBeach Jewelry 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Rolling Ring ||	  Love these rings  I really love these rings. They fit well & I love that I can wear on my thumb or on my finger! Came right on time & well worth the price! <end>  Very Nice  I love this ring! It is so hard to find this style in gold! The ring is beautiful and of good quality. <end>  love these rings  These were exactly what I was looking for. Great for work and going out. Sometime I would even stack with other rings. Size was accurate <end>  OK  I like the ring, it's cute. I bought it to wear as a thumb ring. I've been wearing it every day since I got it (about 2 weeks) and it has already tarnished. I paid $20 for a $20 ring. <end>  Good for the price  I really like the way this ring came out - it's very true to the picture. If i had to say one negative thing about it, it would have to be that getting the ring on is a bit of a challenge! It's not quite a smooth procedure, and every time I go to put it over my finger, I feel like I'm going to grind the finish off. However, it's still holding up and it looks really good. This is a nice every day ring that goes with anything. <end>  Classy  I wanted a classy piece to wear on my right hand for work when I'm wearing Gold. I found that I will end up wearing this outside of work. Very classy looking <end>  Love it  This ring is great for the price. Most of my rings are silver, so i bought because it was inexpnesive. I love it. I have gotten so many compliments. I definity recommed buying it. <end>  nice ring  I like these type of wedding bad rings. This particular one is well worth the money. It looks nice and teh gold color is very bright. I am not sure how long the plating will last. <end>

 B00007FPTM  PalmBeach Jewelry 5/8 TCW Princess-Cut Cubic Zirconia 14k Yellow Gold Over Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Bad customer service  When I received the earrings, I loved them.

If you're a cat-lover like me--or if you just like whimsical pieces of jewelry--this kitty's for you! I laugh every time I look at it--this cat is hanging on for dear life!

You can slide it onto almost any sterling chain you have and I promise you, people will be stopping you to admire it (and enjoy a good laugh with you)!

 B00007GG0U  PalmBeach Jewelry Crystal Goldtone Metal Enamel-Finish Multi-Color Dragonfly Pin ||	  Average  The dragonfly pin was just as expected, and the delivery was prompt.However, please note the following 1. The pin is packaged in a flimsy paper box with "Made in China" on it. So you will need to re-package it as a gift.2. The flimsy paper box was mailed in a standard business envelope (8.5 x 11), so it was completely squashed. I really expected the pin to be broken, but it wasn't.3. Overall, the product was just like the picture, but it would have been nice if they took more care in packaging. I read several other reviews (after receiving the pin) about the company that stated similar experiences. <end>  Crystal Dragonfly Pin  Gave it to my Mom for Christmas. She loved it. It was a little smaller than I expected and more enamel. I was very pleased with the purchase though and expediting of order. Will order from Palm Beach again. <end>
 B00007GGM7  PalmBeach Jewelry Oval Cut Simulated Coral 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Cocktail Ring ||	  IT IS A RED STONE!  When the ring arrived it was not all the nice salmon/peach coral color you see on the picture. It was bright red and I returned it immediately. <end>  A Gumball ring  The picture is not an accurate representation of this ring. The picture depicts a ring of soft, butter-y coral hue, when in actuality, it's a brash, carnival orange. It wasn't even worth my time to return it - so it will sit in my jewelry case as a reminder to be careful and ask questions! <end>  Nice ring for the price  Matched exactly my earrings what I had from before. Looks nice and not cheap. This store has a nice collection <end>
 B00007GI7K  Byzantine Bracelet 8&quot; ||	  Too small, cheaply made  The bracelet actually measures about 7-7.5" closed. The clasp bends very easily, and the "bar" it clicks onto is actually an extremely thin strand of metal. I suspect it'll break within a week or so.Unfortunately, I bought this for my husband a couple days more than a month before Valentine's Day - it can't be returned.Ah well. At least it wasn't outrageously expensive. But save yourself the angst - don't buy it. <end>  byzantine bracelet  i can where an 8" bracelet. but this one measures a 1/2" longer. i have to get it resized smaller. <end>
 B00007GIGI  PalmBeach Jewelry Goldtone Metal &quot;Greek Key&quot; Necklace 18&quot; ||	  Greek Key necklace  The picture of this necklace is deceiving. It is not nearly as nice as it looks. I also had requested the item be sent directly to the recipient. Instead the company didn't heed my request but sent it to me, the purchaser. So I incurred shipping costs twice! Not happy at all with this item nor with the company (Bealls, FL)that sells it. <end>  review if the product I purchased  Because I love it. there was nothing that I didn't like about it, and I would recommend it to others. thanks. <end>
 B00007GIQ8  Pear Cut Simuluated Smoky Quartz Crystal Accent 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Cocktail Ring ||	  Far nicer than pic shows  Not shown in photo is a very beautiful romanesk setting that the stone sits on.One of the nicest pieces I've ever purchased under 10 dollars. <end>  Smokey Quartz Ring  I agree with the other poster..This is a gorgeous ring..I even put a little bleach on it, to see if it would discolor, and it didn't..A lovely piece..Palm Beach Jewelry is very nice.. <end>  large  larger than anticipated but very nice. Received lots of compliments. High quality for the money. <end>  It's a BIG ring...but beautiful  It is a very big ring that matches the earrings also sold on Amazon exactly. I got it in a size 6 and that is a little too big for my pinkie finger. I should have bought a size 5. It dwarfs my diamond rings and takes away from their beauty because it has its own beauty. I honestly would not know that it is a CZ ring unless I asked the owner. The CZ's surrounding the larger stone look fantastically real because they are the proper size for this ring and are not at all gaudy. Just be sure of your ring size before you buy the ring. <end>
 B00007GIYZ  PalmBeach Jewelry Men&apos;s 14k Yellow Gold-Plated Eagle Pendant and Chain 24&quot; ||	  Gorgeous  T.he pendant was just simply beautiful and the chain a work of art.

 B00007GJXT  PalmBeach Jewelry 1.54 TCW Princess-Cut Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Ring ||	  A Really Nice, Unique Ring,  When my mother's wedding ring started to break, I decided not to wear it for everyday use, and so I looked around for something that looked good, but that wouldn't cause me a moment's worry if it became lost or broken, or, Heaven forbid, stolen.I tried a few different rings before settling on this one. It doesn't have any bits that stand up, so when my daughter and I have tickling fights, she doesn't get scratched, (and for that matter neither do I), and I can wear it while cooking or cleaning without a problem. The design is gorgeous and I've gotten a lot of complements about it since I started wearing it. I like it so much that I've promised myself someday I'll have a real ring made that looks like it.I've had it about a year now - the stones are still tight in their settings, and it's survived all kinds of evil treatment because I don't ever take off my wedding ring. I don't think I could have done better for twice the money. <end>
 B00007GKTK  PalmBeach Jewelry Diamond Accent 10k White Gold Two-Piece Bridal Engagement Wedding Ring Set ||	  beautiful  my wife loved this its beautiful great quality great price we had it taken to zales to verify that the diamonds were real due to the price and they sure are <end>
 B00007GMVI  PalmBeach Jewelry 5.81 TCW Oval Cut Aurora Borealis Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Cocktail Ring ||	  Nice Sparkler!  There's no need to wait until the Fourth of July to see fireworks, just enjoy the ones created by this ring! For $40 it's a great buy, the stone is a bit on the large side but not too large (1/2" high and 3/8" wide), and the ring itself is sturdy and made well. The band (especially on the bottom) is thick enough to handle years of wear.In my opinion this is more of an everyday ring, looks great with jeans, etc.It's definitely worthy of being part your ring collection. <end>  Very pretty  I ordered this ring with some reservations- was worried that there would be scratches on the gem, however it arrived fast and in perfect condition. Its sparkly yet in a way understated at the same time. I get lots of compliments on it, and its very comfortable to wear. <end>  A Keeper  My choice with this ring certainly exceeded my expectations. It's a substantial stone and the ring feels extremely comfortable on my finger. I ordered my true size and it was perfect. I'm very happy with my decision, you will be too!!!! It's gorgeous!!!! <end>  Colorful ring  This ring is beautiful!!! I purchased it for my daughter for her birthday. She loves it!!! It arrived on time. My daughter sits and stares at it to watch the colors dance as she moves her hand. <end>  Ring  One of the most beautiful rings I've seen. When I wear it with the necklace I get so many compliments. It sparkes and shines and reflects color everywhere. Thank you. A++++ <end>  Short term wow, long term a little disappointing  I like this product. It is beautiful when the sun catches it. It really reflects awesome colors onto surrounding objects. I had bought one similar that was real crystal but had a cheap band which discolored. This one is sterling silver so I knew discoloring would not be an issue. However this stone is of manmade material and scratched very easily and in months looked like the stone in my other ring which took four years of everyday wear to look like that. So if you don't wear daily or make sure you take off for unlady like jobs it's worth it. <end>  beautiful  Amazons service is great! In no time at all i received my ring and its in awesome condition i love it! <end>

 B00007JKAP  7.25-Carat Oval-Cut Genuine Midnight Blue Sapphire 10k Yellow Gold Drop Pendant and Chain 18&quot; ||	  Bleh  The sapphire I received wasn't as blue as the one in the photo. The diamonds surrounding it were a lot smaller and the sapphire looks scratched. This makes me wonder if the sapphire is really genuine. Also, the box it came in was crushed. I need a new one to put it in before I give it away as a Christmas gift. To be fair, the pendant is still pretty just not as beautiful as it is in the picture.On the bright side, the shipping was fast. I am unsure if I'd ever order from them again. A solid "maybe..." <end>
 B00007LVZ1  PalmBeach Jewelry 5-Piece Multi-Gemstone Earring Set ||	  One level below poor quality  These look great on this page. However, either the seller's quality control failed or the quality level itself is not as pictured. The set I received was all tarnished, the stones were considerably lighter than pictured here, and, worst of all, the amethyst pair were missing. So I returned them. It took 2 weeks and several emails after the seller had received the return (delivery confirmation) for me to get my money back. No explanation from the seller regarding any of this, so I will not be doing business with Palm Beach Jewelry anymore. <end>

 B000085Q12  12.86-Carat Oval-Cut Purple Cubic Zirconia 18k Yellow Gold Over Sterling Silver Cocktail Ring ||	  Beautiful bezzle, disappointing stone.  Ring arrived in a beautifully gift wrapped chiffon wrap with a matching silk rope. The band is gorgeous, the gold plate is true color, smooth, and the bezel is intricate. The cubic is disappointing, not a true amethyst color, it is darker, more berry, and has little lift above the bezel. Cubic has little fire, mostly flat at all angles despite the cut. <end>
 B000090NNB  Amazon.com  Zoppini Red Oval Link  Clothing ||	  Nice but very expensive  I'd like to make an Italian link bracelet with every other link being one of these, but that's 9*$15=$135! -- far too expensive for this class of costume jewelry bracelet.

 B0000AGQ35  PalmBeach Jewelry 18k Gold over Sterling Silver 3-Piece Jade & Onyx Pendant Set ||	  Very pleased!  This necklace is very high quality. I bought it for myself and have enjoyed wearing it. It would also make an impressive gift. Kudoos to Amazon for offering this item. Carolina Girl <end>
 B0000AGQNA  Peridot/Tourmaline 10k Gold Ring ||	  Nice Item!  I purchased this ring for myself for Valentine's Day. I really love the way it looks on my hand. The craftsmanship is quite nice, though the prongs tend to get caught in my clothes. I don't care, though, because it is just beautiful and well worth the price. <end>  Nice Item!

 B0000AGSCN  Green Jade Sterling Silver Elephant Ring ||	  Cool ring but size runs big  The ring is very cool. But the silver design surrounding the stone distracts from the jade and elephane. The size runs big. I wear a size 6 and it fits like a 7. For the price I am not returning it to get a new one. But it would've been nice if it had fit better. <end>  Cool ring but size runs big  The ring is very cool. But the silver design surrounding the stone distracts from the jade and elephane.

 B0000AHE2T  14k Yellow Gold Amethyst Post Earrings ||	  Like works of art for your ears  These earrings are just fabulous and well worth the price. The stones are beautiful, with even color throughout. The stones are cut fairly simply, which nicely offsets the ornate design of the setting. The settings are sturdy, and the backs are a decent size. I'd buy these again. <end>  Beautiful Earrings!  Glowing yet delicate in design, earrings that can be used for almost all occasions. I am most pleased. <end>  Not worth it  While the stone and earring itself is beautiful, the post broke off when putting into my wife's ears. she did not even get to wear them one time. poor quality for the price. I could go to the Jewelry store and get a better quality for less price. I do NOT recommend these AT ALL <end>
 B0000AHEAO  14k Yellow and White Gold Diamond-cut Chandelier Post Earrings ||	  very beautyful earrings  I just received this earrings in the mail. By the way shipping was the fastest ever I ordered those Wednesday and got them today Friday WOW. I found them in the Gold box and ordered them for a fantastic price, I wasn't sure though that when I would get them home that I would actually keep them, but when I tried them on they were just stunning even my two kids told me those earrings are a definit keeper. Buy them even for the regular price they are great great earrings. I would buy them ten times over again. Thank you Amazon.com for the speedy shipping and the great products you bring to us. <end>
 B0000AOX1K  14k Yellow Gold and Sterling Silver Dangle Drop Textured Earrings ||	  Really nice looking!  These earrings look even better in 'real life'. The details are well done and the length is perfect - not too long, not too short. <end>
 B0000AOX1S  Sterling Silver, Peridot, Blue Chalcedony and Blue Topaz Earrings ||	  Not as great as the picture on the web  From the picture on the web, these seem to be dangle earrings with great colors and transparency. But it wasn't until I got them that I realized that the stones are drab and quite opaque, connected through a rigid post in the back with no chance of dangling. And they are quite heavy too. <end>
 B0000AOX1X  Sterling Silver Amethyst and Garnet Necklace, 16" ||	  She loved it!  Nothing expensive, but it's well made and looks great. My wife still wears this from time to time. <end>
 B0000AOX21  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Necklace, 16" ||	  Simple and beautiful  The look is great - and it is a great value, so I bought the matching bracelet. I have no complaints - and have received only compliments from everyone who sees this necklace! <end>  a beautiful necklace  The stones of this necklace r very shining and clear, I think my gf's sister will like it, I am also thinking about buying the matching bracelet for her birthday. <end>  Beautiful  It's a beautiful necklace and there are matching ear rings that can be bought to go with it. The company delivered in a rapid response also. Highly recommended. <end>
 B0000AOX24  Sterling Silver and Amethyst Heart Earrings ||	  Summer Perfection  Silver and Amethyst  Trusted Amazon and felt they would sell only the best for me at a great price...right ? They hit the ball out of the park!These earrings are hefty weight without being &quot;heavy&quot;. Stones have gorgeous coloring, and the cut must be incredible because they sparkle sparkle sparkle.At the price...I am ordering a few more pairs for my family...and that order will be free shipping so how fabulous is that !? <end>  Wonderful earrings  I ordered three pair of these earrings for Christmas gifts for the preteen set and am absolutely delighted. Very nice quality and beautifully presented, boxed in a small velvet pouch. Absolute perfection! <end>
 B0000AOX2E  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Slide on Omega Chain, 16" ||	  Amazingly Beautiful Piece  Wonderful Piece of fairly priced jewelry that looks stunning on.Appears much more expensive than the purchase price.Really nice deal. <end>  Should have option for 10 star rating!!  After looking on numerous sites for a Sterling Omega at a reasonable price, I found this one on "old reliable" Amazon.com. Description failed to show the width of the chain so I inquired to the original review customer and she advised that it is approx. 7mm+ and that the photo does not do justice to the Omega; I took her advice, ordering early in case I had to return it. My only regret.....I didn't order 2 or 3 more of this item! I bought the chain with the included onyx slide-pendant though I was not shopping for a pendant - but after I put these two pieces together it became obvious that they were meant to "be together"! If you are undecided about the quality of this extremely underpriced set - you are passing up the bargain of the season!!! I was adamantly convinced that Sterling Silver could NEVER be a substitute for the elegance and quality of white gold...this is one time I am not ashamed to admit that I WAS WRONG! <end>
 B0000AOX2P  Sterling Silver, Black Onyx and Mother of Pearl Pendant on Double Leather Cord, 17" ||	  GREAT GIFT - TRENDY YET AFFORDABLE  Just what we've been looking for - a graduation gift that's both trendy and affordable.Most of us know that anything on a leather cord is considered &quot;in&quot; by sweet young things. So to find this onyx and pearl pendant on said cord was a happy surprise.A pearl is, of course, a classic fashion statement, and the addition of the leather cord makes it state of the art.Plus, the price is right! We think the grads we know and love will be delighted! <end>  truly impressive  I saw this in my goldbox and was attracted by the product description. I especially liked the fact that despite its very simple modern style, every component is real stuff. I received my necklace in very nice packaging and can't be more pleased. Everybody who saw me wear this told me how nice it looked on me. It can be a really lovely gift for yourself or your friends. <end>
 B0000AOX3M  Sterling Silver Amethyst, Black Onyx, Grey Shell and Mother of Pearl Necklace, 17" ||	  ACCEPTABLE  Unlike the matching bracelet I previously ordered from Amazon.com, this necklace was acceptable in that the Mother-of-Pearl inlay did not have a gross defect in its surface. Value for the dollar spent, but no bargain by any means. <end>
 B0000AOXHE  Akoya Cultured Pearl 5.5-6.0mm Pendant on 18k Yellow Gold Chain, 18" ||	  All tangled up!  The pendant is perfect, but the chain was all tangled up when I received it, and it took a very long time to untangle. It's one of those rough chains that would tangle very easily, so I had to use another chain. I don't see how the chain is 18kt. I would not have purchased this except that I got 50% off the item. <end>  Akoya -always means beautiful pearl  This is a classic. Very simple in design, the setting does not appear extremely attractive from above (the wearer's perspective), but is very nice from afar. This would make a great 'first dance' gift or a special birthday present to a special daughter.I received a white pearl with excellent luster and smooth surface -- no blemishes at all. The chain could be a bit more resilient, but for the price, this was a great deal (1/2 price deal!). <end>
 B0000AOXIB  Akoya Cultured Pearl 7.0-7.5mm Pendant w/ Diamond (.10ctw) on 18k Yellow Gold Chain, 18" ||	  A perfect gift  This necklace that I received is flawless. The pearl has a high quality, and the diamond is very shining (although it's a little bit small).My wife likes it.For this price, I give it a Five Stars. <end>  diamond great, pearl disappointing  The diamond was beautiful, but the pearl's surface was not "clean." Imperfections were visible if standing next to someone wearing it. It's odd that the quality of hte pearl was not great, while the diamond was very good quality. Not a great pairing. I returned it. <end>
 B0000AOXJY  Tahitian Cultured Pearl 10.0-10.5mm Pendant w/ Diamond (.15ctw) on 18k White Gold Chain ||	  Mother's Day Gift  I bought this necklace as a Mother's Day gift for my wife. She liked the necklace very much, and wore it to dinner that day. I recommend it as a gift. <end>
 B0000AOXKC  Freshwater Cultured Pearl 9.5-10.0mm Button Earrings ||	  Pearl earrings ... good value  This was a very good value for these earrings and an answer to a needed gift <end>
 B0000AOXKJ  14k Yellow Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl 6.0-6.5mm Earrings ||	  Such a great gift, I think I'll go buy a pair for myself!  I bought these earrings along with the matching pearl pendant for my sister's birthday. After I saw them on her, I decided to get them for myself! The size is perfect, the color is beautiful and the box it came in made up for the fact there is no gift wrapping. Would buy again as another gift... after I buy myself a pair! <end>  Beautiful  Gave these very pretty earrings to my sister for Christmas. She loved them too. <end>  Too small to make a statement  I bought these with the matching pendant because they were on sale for $20. For that price, I'm happy with the earrings. On their own they are too small to make a fashion statement, but paired with diamond studs or some gold hoops, they look really nice. The box they came in is also lovely. <end>  Beautiful and great buy!  I bought these with the matching pendant with diamond accent for my boyfriend's mom as a birthday gift. They are the perfect size for everyday outfit. I have read reviews from others that the pearls fell off. I would have no way to know how they last, but they are beautiful and would defintely buy more of the same. <end>
 B0000AOXKS  14k Yellow Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl 7.0-7.5mm Earrings w/ Diamond (.10ctw) ||	  Very pleased  The earrings were better than expected. The pearls were large and the diamonds were a great touch. My wife loved them and enjoys showing them off. Service was great and delivery very prompt. Would do business again. <end>
 B0000AOXKU  Freshwater Cultured Pearl 8.0-8.5mm Pendant w/ Diamond (.07ctw) on 14k Yellow Gold Chain, 18" ||	  beautiful  I got this necklace for my mom for her birthday and she loved. Althought not as big as it looks on the screen (I guess none of them really are) it's still a really beautiful, shimmering, pearl with a sparkly little diamond. The chain is very thin though so it needs to be treated with delicacy. But all in all I'm giving it 5 stars. <end>  Freshwater Cultured Pearl 8.0-8.5mm Pendant w/ Diamond (.07ctw) on 14k Yellow Gold Chain, 18"  I bought this for my Mom for Mothers day and she loves it!!!!! <end>
 B0000AOXLL  14k White Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl 5.0-5.5mm Earrings ||	  Beautiful inexpensive earings  I bought these earings for my wedding day and they are beautiful. Great price and free shipping. <end>  A teen rates the pearls  I am a 16 year old girl, and I just bought these earrings from a gift certificate for the holidays. The earrings are the perfect size and color to wear every day to school or to dress up for parties. I recommend them to any other teens that aren't looking for something too big or flashy. <end>  Great color, luster, and the perfect size  These pearls aren't flashy or glamorous (I was looking for something not too big and gaudy), but they're great for everyday wear and look very nice with both business and casual attire. Great color, luster, and the perfect size. There were few (if any) imperfections in the pearls, the backs are white gold and look very secure, They came in very nice packaging, and the free shipping was very timely. <end>  Look OK, but not that great.  I bought these as an inexpensive gift for my girlfriend. You get what you pay for; the other day, the pearl came off of the backing as she was taking it off. Naturally this happened AFTER it was too late to return the item. So if you want to wear these once, that works, but they aren't suitable for long-term use. <end>  Lovely earrings for the price!  These earrings are quite small, but very pretty! They seem perfectly round to me with no noticable flaws. A great deal overall!! <end>
 B0000AOXLO  14k White Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl 8.0-8.5mm Earrings ||	  Beautiful!  After I wrote a glowing review, the pearl fell off backing two hours later. No Stars. <end>  She loved them  Got these for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day and she loved them! <end>
 B0000AOXM5  14k White Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl 8.0-8.5mm Pendant, 18" ||	  Good quality for the price  I am not one to order jewelry online, and had second thoughts after I ordered this necklace, however upon receipt, I was more than happy with the quality. My only criticism would be that I felt the chain was a little light, however I find this in much jewelry these days. Overall a good product for a good price with the usual prompt Amazon service. <end>
 B0000APUD4  Akoya Cultured Pearl 5.5-6.0mm Necklace, 18" ||	  Very nice  These are really nice and great quality. They arrived really quickly and in great condition. <end>
 B0000APUDK  Akoya Cultured Pearl 5mm Earrings w/ Diamond (.04ctw) ||	  Just like the picture  Came in lovely box- looked just like the picture, good representation. Fast service <end>  Displeased in service  The product is gorgeous but the manufacturer is not someone that I would deal with again. It was suppose to be here in two days and it was over a week. I guess it was on backorder but they didn't seem to send out an email stating that fact. It would have taken care of alot of emails and phone calls for me if a simple email had gone out saying it was on backorder. <end>
 B0000APUED  Grey & White Freshwater Cultured Pearl Stretch Bracelet, 7" ||	  Grey & White Freshwater Cultured Pearl Stretch Bracelete, 7"  It's beautiful and I've gotten quite a few compliments on it. <end>  bracelet  still have it . very nice.bought few yrd a go i like went it came. had it on a few times <end>
 B0000AS4NX  14k Yellow and White Gold Italian Heart Anklet, 9.5" ||	  Lost  I wore this anklet twice and then it was gone. I believe it broke at one of the hearts, the anklet is a white gold heart and then gold chain, then heart etc and I think the anklet has a weak point where the white heart is attached to the chain. So it was gone and I was very disappointed. Although it was a beautiful anklet and I was happy in the beginning, I don't think the way it is put together is very strong. I'm sad. <end>  Poorly crafted  The chain was tied in a knot that both my husband and I tried to untie, without success, for one hour. Why we even tried, I have no idea, because the anklet is also very poorly fabricated and molded -- it basically looks like a child's bracelet that was purchased at a five-and-dime. We sent it back, knot and all. <end>  Loved it!!!!!  My fiancee went and bought this item over 4 yrs ago, It was so special to me, he gave it to me for xmas of that yr. Well I never had a problem with the delicate bracelet. Only until I was in a dress shop and I think it got hooked on a dress, and never saw it again. I wanted to replace it, since it is so sentimental to me, on more then one level and they do not have it for sale. I really wish they would bring it back! <end>  Quite Satisfied  We were quite satisfied with this purchase, which was a surprise gift for my wife. It had a beautiful shimmer to it, and looked really like quality jewelry. It was hard to find jewelry that showed both quality and subtlety, and I was glad to have found this one. <end>
 B0000AS4OX  14k Yellow Gold 2.7mm Anchor Chain Anklet, 9" ||	  Awesome piece!  First of all, this anchor link is so popular right now. I never take this anklet off, only to shave my legs in the shower. I've gone through at least 5 other ankle bracelets before this because they've gotten caught on towels or clothes and I've destroyed them. This anklet feels excellent, it's not rough on the edges and I have worn it with great success and without damaging it! It's perfect! <end>  I concur with the only other review...  I was delighted with the quality... the weight is just right, not too much, not too little. It is exactly what I wanted it to be. <end>  worth the money  This is a great anklet. I never take it off. The clasp is strong and it never gets caught on anything. Very sturdy and pretty too. <end>
 B0000AS4PE  14k White Gold 1.5mm Rolo Anklet, 9" ||	  It is pretty but really tiny  Its a beautiful anklet, but I really thought it would be bigger. <end>
 B0000AS4Q2  14k White Gold Singapore Anklet, 9" ||	  Much thinner than expected  The anklet is very pretty, seems to be made well, and it's comfortable around my ankle. The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is that it's extremely thin, barely even showing up on my ankle. <end>
 B0000AS4S5  14k White Gold 1.5mm Diamond-Cut Rope Necklace, 18" ||	  SIMPLY gorgeous!  This is a very clean, simple and elegant piece of jewelry. Not something for those who prefer larger pieces of jewelry, as it is understated. It goes well with a turtleneck and jeans or a suit and a silk camisole.I am 100% pleased with this purchase and have ordered a lovely white gold bracelet to complete the shopping spree.I'd recommend this to those who don't care to spend a lot of money on flashy jewelry, but who prefer the minimalist side of life.  -) <end>  A Valentine Gift for the Wife!  My wife was in need of a larger chain for one of her precious pendants. She noticed what my sister had one and told me she just loved her chain. As a husband who rarely notices some else's jewelry I search the internet for a cut diamond chain since I did not have time to go the retailers. I ordered it and the shipping time was only about four days, not seven to ten days as advertised.The wife was elated and it was exactly what she wanted. I turned out to be a great Valentine's Day. She still brags about it. <end>  Nice necklace for all occasions.  I agree with the previous user. This chain is "very clean, simple and elegant piece of jewelry". I'm happy I got it because its thin enough to look elegant, and thick enough not to break when you pull on at accidently. The price was good, and it is White Gold! I have little attacments hanging on my chain,and it looks very nice. It doesn't get dirty and doesn't have any oxidation (which makes silver turn dark) <end>  white gold rope chain  This was just what I was looking for and the quality is superb. Thanks. A+A+A+A+A+A+ <end>  Good fit for many silver pendants  I bought this chain to go with a silver pendant. The chain looked great with the pendant. However the metal weight is not as it described as 6.8g. It only weights about 3.8g. <end>  Not Happy  Arrived with several kinks in chain. It was a gift so we were not happy.Delivery time seemed long compared to other purchases. <end>  Beautiful chain.  I bought this chain for a friend to go with a silver pendant. The chain looked great with the pendant and my friend loved it. <end>
 B0000AS4S8  14k White Gold 1.5mm Diamond-Cut Rope Necklace, 20" ||	  Not what I expected  First of all, this was a gold box special, but I was charged full-price. Secondly, the chain came with distinct kinks in it. I have gotten most of them out, but a few remain. These little &quot;knots&quot; cause the chain to look like less expensive costume jewelry. Admittedly, $50 is not a high price, but the chain doesn't even look that good. I also can't get customer service to respond to the wrong pricing. Maybe by the time you read this, I will have received an answer though. <end>  looks good  Delivery was fast. Was disappointed at first because it arrived with several kinks in it. With about a half hour of gentle manipulation, I was able to get it straightened out. Seems to me that chains like that should be shipped taped to a ring of cardboard or some other way of keeping it straight. Just send the gift box with it. The shipping box was more than big enough for it to be laid out in some fashion, instead of crumpled up in that little blue sack.It looks good. It doesn't seem too thin or too bulky, and the diamond cuts add some sparkle to it. I hope my girlfriend likes it, and I'm glad I was patient with getting the kinks out. Had I put any force into it, I could have really damaged it. <end>  Very nice for the price  This was a gift and I was not sure of the quality when I ordered but when I saw it I was impressed. Very nice for a reasonable price. <end>
 B0000AS4UE  14k Yellow Gold 1.1mm Italian Box Chain Necklace, 18" ||	  Nice Necklace and good price!  I always like Amazon.com Collection. In last two years, I have had quite a collection.They usually got nice design ideas from big brands and are also very well-made. Most of them are no longer available. But I continue enjoying checking the site once a while. (Amazon likes to put one or two items on sale with really good price!!!)I purchased several vintage gold pendants on Ebay. They are cute but quite small. So I need a decent K gold necklace. I received this necklace today and was very impressed with the weight and quality.From my gold jewelry(!) shopping experience, it is an excellent price of $10 per gram for 14K gold jewelry. (Unless it's very unusual great design, I still believe the weight is an important factor of gold jewelry...) Since the gold price has hit the record high, I was suprised this necklace is still with a good price!If you like something elegant and subtle, I highly recommend this necklace. <end>  Chain Necklace  I have rated this necklace as a "5". It is exactly the correct lengthand looks very nice. <end>  14k Yellow Gold 1.1mm Italian Box Chain Necklace,18&quot;  Dear Sir,I am no expert in jewelry so I only know what I've seen,but this &quot;14k gold necklace&quot;is the worst pice of junk that I have had the unfortunate exprience to have had to bye. Did I actually said I bought it? Well then shame on me! Anyone even thinking of byeing this you've been warned!{so don't be anothere shame on you.} Just Don't do the same thing as I did resist yourself from buying it. Sorry guys make sure you put out a product worth selling for $65.00 or don't sell it at all!Sicerly, <end>
 B0000AS4UZ  14k Yellow Gold 1mm Round Snake Chain Necklace, 16" ||	  Superb quality, Brilliant shine  Has substance, beautiful...Fits my pendants perfectly... I wanted a snake chain that would not be flimsy, or too tiny to see, this is perfect...Recommended...If I could get a 15" chain in this also, I'd buy it for a "layered" look... You won't be disappointed, looks & feels like a chain coming from an expensive jewelry store! <end>  14K 1mm round snake chain 16"  The chain is lovely but I ordered 16" and got 15 1/4".Both chains I ordered, 16" and 18" were about 3/4 to 1" shorter.That seems deceptive to me. You should get what you paid for!Won't buy jewelry from here again. <end>  Gold Snake Chain Necklace  This is exactly what I expected. I'm very pleased. Thank you. <end>  EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!  This chain is a beautiful, 16&quot; snake chain, it shows off my pendants perfectly. I wanted a chain that I could wear like a choker. The gold is a rich tone, and the chain is smooth and &quot;slinky&quot; but yet has body. The clasp is secure and easy to manipulate. This was in my gold box, and I was leary of ordering jewelry online. I was not disappointed! <end>
 B0000AS4VJ  14k Yellow Gold 1.6mm Italian Round Snake Chain Necklace, 18" ||	  Pretty but will destroy your hair  This is a pretty little chain, and it's surprisingly sturdy for the price.Unfortunately the gaps between the links are just wide enough to trap hair at the nape of your neck, and if you're not careful, you'll end up with giant wads of torn-out hair stuck in the chain. <end>  Best and heaviest for the price  I shopped many other on-line stores and this is the weightiest and best made snake chain for the the price. I don't agree that it pulls on the back of the hair, but everyone is different.If you're looking for a great quality 18" snake chain that looks more expensive than it is, don't hesitate. I wish Amazon had it in white gold as well. <end>
 B0000AS4VZ  14k White Gold 1.6mm Italian Round Snake Chain Necklace, 24" ||	  NICE  Very nice chain---I wear it alone with two other necklaces for a layered look. It was a little thinner than I thought it would be for an 8 gram necklace, but its sleekness made up the difference. <end>
 B0000AS4WA  14k Yellow Gold .9mm Italian Octagonal Snake Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  This is beautiful!  I may not be a jewelry expert, but I was desperate to find a 20" chain to wear with a new opal pendant and could not find one, affordable or otherwise, locally. This chain is beautiful! I have big, clumsy fingers and so don't find the lobster clasp any easier to use than a "normal" clasp, but the chain is silky feeling and has a stunning shine to it. The price was fantastic as well! If it is available in other diameters, I will buy more. Thank you Amazon! Once again, you have exceeded my expectations! <end>  smooth as silk.....  This chain surpassed my expectations. The quality was excellent, the chain never becomes tangled and feels smooth as silk. I wear it with a small gold piece and it sets off the piece beautifully. It is the perfect length for everyday wear and the weight of the chain is sturdy without being heavy. I would absolutely recommend this item and it would make a lovely gift as well. <end>  beautiful  I was very pleased with my purchase, and would purchase from this seller again <end>  excellent value  This piece of jewlery is of exceptional quality at a very reasonable price. I love it and will wear it regularly. <end>  In the interest of accuracy and fairness...  ...reviewer Debbie Downey should realize that her insipid comments serve only to hurt the manufacturer of this necklace, and mislead potential buyers. If Amazon made an error by shipping the incorrect item (understandable, considering the millions of orders that are processed monthly), than her complaint is with Amazon - and a 1-star rating has no effect on Amazon.com. It really irks me when rocket scientists give 1-star ratings, due to shipping and packing issues, that bear no reflection on the product itself!Judging by the other reviewer, I'm sure this item is fine, and my rating will help to balance things out a bit.Note to lKellogg  Sorry, but your comments don't ring true. If you want to return this item, you can simply print a copy of your invoice by accessing the "your account" setting on the Amazon.com website, and viewing recent orders. As far as blue and green rings are concerned, are you sure they weren't on your neck prior to receiving this necklace? It's hard to believe that an outfit as reputable as Amazon would use a supplier who would not provide a legitimate gold product. Regarding QVC, you'll notice that Amazon never rips off unwary buyers by offering 10k jewelry with worthless synthetic stones, or charging exorbitant shipping fees (and not even combining them if you order multiples of the same item!!!!). Amazon offers free shipping on almost all orders over $25. If QVC did that, they'd give up multi-millions of dollars in price-gouged profit! <end>
 B0000AS4WZ  14k Yellow Gold 1.4mm Italian Octagonal Snake Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  Absolutely Wonderful  I have purchased both a 20" .9mm Italian Octagonal Snake and this 1.4mm Italian Octagonal Snake. I am much, much more pleased with the 1.4mm. The .9mm is a bit smoother as the links are smaller, but the 1.4mm is a massively thicker necklace that does not look nearly as fragile. The .9mm just left me with the feeling that it might break rather easily. The 1.4mm is probably a bit stronger, and the additional weight and size feel better... the .9mm weighed almost nothing. I would note that the links are much harder to see on the .9mm, so if you are looking for something that feels like silk, the .9mm might be the better choice, but the 1.4mm is not rough by any means. <end>  1.4 mm italian octogonal snake chain 20"  Very nice quality. Arrived in timely fashion. The lobster claw was smaller than I thought it would be. I really love the necklace. <end>

With just the right amount of sparkle. <end>  Better than I expected  I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it! Not too fancy but just enough sparkle so it can be worn with casual, but enough sparkle for evening wear. <end>  White Gold Chain  Excellent product! Great quality and well priced. Would buy other products from this sellter. <end>
 B0000AS4YG  Men's 14k Yellow Gold 4.9mm Italian Figaro Chain Necklace, 18" ||	  Beautiful Necklace!!!!!  I purchased this for my son and was very impressed with the weight and quality. Local jewelers were asking twice the price or more for less weight and quality! My son loves his gift and I loved the price! I would definitely recommend this to everyone looking for a 14K Figaro chain. My only disappointment was that it did not come in a nicer box, but I was aware of this prior to making the purchase. Also, shipping was free and it arrived the very next day! Great buy and service! <end>  Figaro Necklace  This necklace has the weight and feel of pure joy! Also if you're in search of an necklace that you want to be noticed, then this is surely the one! <end>  perfect  This is a great chain. Solid, shiney and impressive. If it were made italy it would have gotten 5 stars. <end>  Agradable y bonito  Estoy muy agradado con esta cadena o collar, bonito tejido, macizo no es hueco, y a un buen precio. Lo unico que podria indicar en contra es el acabado de la cadena la cual presenta algunos bordes filosos, pero nada del otro mundo. Estoy muy agradado por esta compra.Ali <end>
 B0000AS4YT  14k Yellow Gold 4.6mm Italian Mariner Chain Bracelet, 8" ||	  Mariner Comfort  This bracelet was bought by me to match another that I have as a result this item proved to wear very comfortable and the 7.9 grams compliment this item as well. So if you're lookin' for a bracelet that isn't too big or have that phoney appearence then this is for you! <end>  Mariner Chain racelet  My husband loved this gift. He told me to rate it as a 5. I expected it to be thicker than it really was. But, it is beautiful. <end>
 B0000AS4YZ  Men's 14k Yellow Gold 6mm Italian Mariner Chain Necklace, 22" ||	  Nice Necklace  The 14kyg necklace is just gorgeous. I bought it for my husband and he loves it.

You can't beat it for this price. <end>
 B0000AS4ZM  14k White Gold 6.9mm Italian Curb Link Bracelet, 8" ||	  bad clasp  Bracelet looked great at first, and for the most part still does EXCEPT the clasp. The clasp has been changing color since about a month after I purchased it. Only worth buying if the price is low enough that you can pay a jeweler to change the clasp. Having the clasp change color makes the whole bracelet look fake. <end>  A Beauty.Worth the Price.  This is my favorite everyday wear bracelet,it is elegant, classy looking and goes with everything. Another fantastic find on Amazon. <end>  Good Value for money...  This bracelet is a good value for money. It looks good. No issue of color change as mentioned in the other review till now. I am satisfied with the bracelet and would recommend it to anyone who is looking at this item right now. <end>  Absolutely beautiful!  I couldn't believe the price on this bracelet. I was worried it would be of inferior quality, but it wasn't. My fiance loves it! He's allergic to most metals with nickel in them, but this doesn't bother him at all. It is gorgeous too!! We plan on having it appraised at our local jeweler, so I will update this review then to reflect the outcome of the appraisal. <end>  Shiny Bracelet  I got this item about three months ago. It's still nice and shiny. I don't see the issue mentioned by the other reviewer. Maybe I'm lucky so far.It's a little big for me. Maybe I should considering give this to my brother. But overall, it's a nice bracelet. <end>
 B0000AS50U  14k Yellow Gold 1.5mm Italian Rolo Chain Necklace, 18" ||	  Nice chain made in Italy  The chain is very nice, not too thin or too bold, obviously to be worn with a pendant. It has a nice lobster claw clasp. Also, be aware that this is Italian gold, and is therefore a bit more bright yellow rather than the darker tone, like gold made elsewhere. I'm a bit doubtful that it indeed weights 3 grams, but it's possible, since the clasp is rather solid. <end>  very disappointed  I was very disappointed with this purchase they made it look 10 times bigger than the actual size they should be specific when they advertise this if it wasn't for someone out of state i would have return it. He is a fairly big boy he ask what is this a braclet ..so not good at all <end>
 B0000AS50V  14K Yellow Gold 1.5mm Italian Rolo Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  INFERIOR QUALITY  This chain has a beautiful color. I put it on. I turned to answer the phone, the chain caught on a button on my blouse, and fell to the ground. I had had it on for less than 2 minutes. So much for the quality. This chain is very weak - not for daily wear. <end>  Beautiful Chain  I purchased this chain for my Mother for her birthday, and not only did I get it really quick it was beautiful. It looks very expensive compared to the price I paid for the chain. This chain is strong and it makes a great gift, it's a great buy for the price. <end>  too thin  I didn't like this item, it's much thinner than pictured. I'm sending mine back and I think it's overpriced. <end>  Great necklace at an awesome price.  Great necklace at an amazing price. I was a little skeptical in the beginning about buying a gold necklace on line, but it is definitely worth it. <end>  narrower than stated  I bought this chain for my beautiful gold cross, the color is rich & the chain has acceptable heft, however it measures only 1mm. I'm keeping it anyway as my cross looks good with it & it does feel substantial for the width, but be aware that this chain is 1mm, not 1.5mm. That is a big difference in a small (thin) chain at today's gold prices. <end>
 B0000AS50Y  14k White Gold 1.5mm Italian Rolo Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  perfect pendant chain  I bought this for a fairly heavy diamond snowflake pendant I received for Valentines Day. The size is perfect & is sturdy enough to hold a valuable & cherished piece of jewelry. It is well polished and nicely finished with the lobster claw clasp. I am more than pleased! <end>  Not too fancy, just right.  I ordered this chain for a small pendant I wanted to wear. The chain is nice but smaller than I expected. It's sturdy and has the lobster claw clasp I was looking for but it's a bit dull and plain. Overall though, I would say it was a good value for the money. <end>
 B0000AS512  14k Yellow Gold 3mm Italian Rolo Chain Necklace, 24" ||	  Excellent chain!  It arrived in a very nice quality velevet box and was better than I expected . A nice heavy weight chain for the price for lockets or larger type pendants or to be worn alone. A bargain! <end>  14k Yellow Gold 3mm Italian Rolo Chain Necklace , 24"  The word quality sums up this product. Great value. Low cost. <end>  Fabulous looking  This chain is so nice I am buying the 20 in one also, and maybe the 18. I notice the price has gone up, and rightly so. Even with the higher price this is still a deal. Looks fabulous by itself or with a pendant. Large and sturdy enough to function as a chain for my sunglasses or badge holder too. <end>
 B0000AS51J  14k Yellow Gold 5 Row Italian Panther Bracelet, 7" ||	  Very Wearable  Nice smooth bracelet that you can wear all the time. Sturdy without being too heavy. I have received lots of compliments. <end>
 B0000AS51L  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Oval Italian Byzantine Bracelet, 7" ||	  best buy  This is my first major jewelry purchase and was it worth it!!!Finally found an affordable byzantine bracelet and it was better than I thought it would be.I haven't taken it off since purchase, I also now want the matching necklace.The lightweight has made it a comfortable daily wear. The bracelet was actually larger and prettier than in the picture.Quite durable.This is a great buy, you will not be disappointed and it will fulfill your byzantine desire.You will not need a larger or wider bracelet, this was perfect.H.C. <end>  oh yeah !!  THIS BRACELET IS ALL THAT !! VERY NICE !! MY WIFE JUST LOVED IT !! <end>  Good looking and well-made.  Nice piece. Perhaps feels just a little light when held, but it is quality workmanship for the price. I recommend it. <end>  Beautiful  This bracelet is lovely. It lies nicely on the wrist and is lightweight. In fact - if I have any gripe about this piece it is that it's too light (not enough gram weight) for the price. Overall I am very happy and look forward to wearing this bracelet for many years to come. <end>  Nice enough  I was looking for a rope bracelet to coordinate with other gold jewelry, and this was the best price I could find. The bracelet looks nice and fits perfectly, but it is very light - as in weightless. It is good for looks if you don't want to spend what it takes to get a quality gold bracelet with more substance and weight. <end>  beautiful bracelet  I was a bit hesitant to order jewelry sight unseen but shouldn't have been in this case. It's a beautiful breacelet - simple yet elegant in design. I never take it off and get many compliments on it's unique design. I will buy from this seller again! <end>  This is very pretty  I purchased this bracelet for my Mom to give me for Christmas. I am very pleased with how pretty it is. It is light weight, and lays beautifully flat on my wrist without twisting or rolling. I haven't taken it off since I got it. <end>  Beautiful! And easy to wear.  This is a beautiful byzantine bracelet, with significant presence, but not clunky. I wear it every day. It's so much a part of me, I completely forget I have it on. And yet, I constantly receive complimets on it. <end>  Nice bracelet  The bracelet was nice. It's light weight, which I didn't really like but overall I think it was a good buy. <end>  worth it  this is a cute bracelet. close to 7 grams of gold for a great price. It also looks really nice on. Great valentines day gift. <end>  Lovely item!  I am so very pleased with this bracelet. I wasn't entirely confident when I placed my order but I am so very glad I did. I would highly recommend this bracelet for any woman. <end>
 B0000AS51N  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Oval Italian Byzantine Chain Necklace, 18" ||	  Beautiful Italian Gold  It is a narrower byzantine than I have seen, a little over a quarter inch width. I like this better, the byzantine can be overdone. It is a beautiful necklace and look. It makes a statement without overpowering. Great price for such a well made necklace. Thank you Amazon. <end>

 B0000AS52E  14k Yellow Coffee Bean Bracelet, 7" ||	  Very pretty bracelet.  It's a great buy and I have gotten many compliments. I also purchased the yellow/white gold coffee bean bracelet as well and wear them together. They really stand out. <end>
 B0000AS533  14k Yellow Gold Lady Bug Enamel Earrings ||	  super cute!  I got these just for fun, and they are really cute! They are of a nice quality and just the right size...and for the low price, they exceeded my expectations. <end>  another great Amazon buy  This is the second pair of gold earrings i've ordered from Amazon.com's line of gold jewelry. They look to be of really good quality, a tad smaller than i expected, but when worn, they're the perfect size. And they'll be perfect for my little girl when it's time to pass these to her. When browsing, i choose Amazon.com's jewelry line first, particulary for the usual free shipping, but now i know i'll get good quality for th price, too. <end>
 B0000AS53C  14k Yellow Gold Geometric Fashion Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  awesome bracelet  I could hardly wait to open the box upon it's arrival, and I was thrilled when I did. This bracelet is very unique and very different.......feels very "weighty" and just looks awesome on my arm. Once you get it on your wrist, the right way, the gold links will lie flat....this takes one or two tries, but the result is worth it..... and that shine!This was my first gold item from Amazon, and I am afraid, NOT my last!! <end>  great accent to multiple bracelet wearers  this bracelet is bold, great shine finish, and dresses up all the six bracelets i wear at one time. the geometric design is eye catching and a pleasure to show off. <end>  Great Deal!  I just got it in the mail today, it's so pretty! I love it! Before I recieved it as a gift, I asked a friend of mine (who works in the jewelry business) if she thought it was a good deal. She said the price was at cost (6 grams of gold is selling for $100) and advised me to definitely get it. Im so glad I did! <end>
 B0000ATC41  14k Yellow Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl 6.0-6.5mm Pendant ||	  Very pretty along w/the matching earrings  I bought these for my sister for her birthday along w/the matching earrings. The set is really pretty together and she loved the gift(s)! The chain is long so it hangs very elegantly and the pearl is a nice color. Great price. <end>  A Perfect Pearl Pendant  I love my pendant. It is delicate and elegant. I have received many compliments on it. It is just the right size to either wear with a dress or just to wear when in jeans and a t-shirt. Not too flashy at all but a noticeable touch of elegance.The quality is excellent. I would definitely purchase again. <end>  Amazing Jewlery Value  My fiancee and I bought this for her mother, who is a blonde and looks absolutely radiant in this necklace. It adds a perfect touch of class to any outfit, just like one of the previous reviewers said (thanks!).The 6.0-6.5 mm pearl size is perfect. I would not go smaller, especially since this is thirty five bucks.The chain is not itty-bitty as some have suggested. It's not a rope of gold, but it is proportioned well relative to the pearl.The setting for the pearl is nice  neutral, yet not boring.Item arrived in top-notch condition, including a nice clasp box and outer hard box, in royal blue. Only lousy part is that outer box has a big inventory sticker on it, so it gets sticky if you want to give this item to someone in the nice blue box with the fuzzy box inside. A little Goo Gone will take care of that.In any event, that one minor downside aside, excellent value on an excellent piece of jewlery! <end>  Nice pendant but needs a different chain  When I first received this necklace, I was disappointed. The pearl seemed small and the chain looked spindly. I almost sent it back. Then I swapped out the chain for one of my own and put the necklace on. What a difference! With a more substantial chain the pearl looks just right. <end>  Pearl pendant necklace  This is a very nice necklace it is a wonderful addition to most any outfit. The chain is a little overly delicate though, making it hard to clasp. But overall it is a wonderful necklace at a fantastic price. <end>

I like how it looks on him; it's not flashy. He's lost weight so has to be careful to not wear it when gardening or shoveling, it's flown right off his hand sometimes!

 B0000AWPK7  18k Yellow Gold 8mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 6.5 ||	  heavy solid gold band  This is a classic - heavy, shiny, true to size. A pleasure to wear every day. <end>  Sweet! UPDATED  I am getting married in a month and had purchased a "square" ring from another site, which I liked, but just did not look all that square to me (I had seen an awesome, very square, chunky design in the form of a cheap ring at Aldo that I was trying to replicate in some way, even though the ring I ended up with was much subtler).So this "square" ring, at first and even second blush, looked rather...round. Plus, it was a 14k ring, which looked too "silvery" to me, as my skin tone is flattered by Autmn-style colors, needing a richer gold color.So, I decided I'd go where the competition was and go to a round ring. If I couldn't get my square edges, at least it would be chunky and a good deal.I had tried round rings, even comfort fits, on at jewelry stores. They were thin and feminine looking. Clearly they were trying to skimp on the materials, and often they were 14k. I noticed the prices were significant at places like Helzberg, being $400 plus, often $500 or more for a "substantial" ring, a price I was unable to pay.In any event, I decided I would try this ring.Something to note is that once you go from size 10 to 10.5, they add an "extra" 1mm to the ring. So, it goes from 8mm to 9mm. Of course, you are paying additional for the additional metal, but it does make the ring a little more substantial top to bottom once you hit 10.5. I am an 11 so I ended up with a "9mm" ring in my basket.I received the ring today and it's a beauty! HEAVY! Wow, my hand has a whole new heft to it, it feels like. This is MUCH MUCH heavier than the thin 14k squared ring I was sent as above. This ring is pretty hefty. Most anyone would be proud of it.On the inside it's stamped with the obligatory "18k" but also a little infinity symbol, which I thought was a little "spiritual" touch to what is most likely a wedding band for the majority of buyers.The ring sits higher above the finger, so it has a profile and height. It is not like a thin little band that hugs your skin. On me, those looked positively feminine. I hated them and that is why I ran from round rings and wanted a more masculine square one.It slips on easily, is very comfortable to wear and slips off with a reasonable amount of wiggling and cajoling. In other words, perfect. True to size, yet even more comfortable than other rings I've tried. The comfort fit interior is very "pillowy" and smooth. Nice.The heft of this ring makes this a great compromise for me, and the PRICE is FANTASTIC!! Feels like one of those $500 gold rings for much less. THANK YOU, AMAZON!UPDATE Oh man, heaviness is a blessing and a curse. I have now gotten married and have worn this ring for a month now. I sort of wish I'd have gotten a lighter band. I still feel this thing weighing down my finger, i.e. the sensation hasn't "deadened" for me. Not a nightmare, not necessarily annoying, but just a little distracting point.Also, since this ring is comfort fit and "puffs out" (is rounded outwards) a little both on the inside and outside (it's not like a straight "pipe segment"), I feel it on the first bone of my middle and pinky fingers when my fingers are together. A little annoying.Of course, I really wish there were no such thing as wedding bands to begin with, I've never really cared for rings! Why not a bracelet or tatoo?! (Half-joking here, and I digress...)Anyhow, this is a beautiful band. It will start off mirror-finish and will scuff up. Mine is now pretty scratched, both micro scratches and also rock-climbing on our honeymoon put larger, fuzzier scuffs on the ring. This can be refinished at any good jeweler, but I prefer the duller look. I don't like shiny-shiny. That felt too feminine.At this point, I obviously have to keep this-very-ring because it was "at the ceremony," and yes, I am very proud of it, but if I could do it all over again I'd scrap the comfort fit bulgy-ness and get a lighter, flatter 14k gold ring, purely for comfort issues. 18k gold is heavy!Remember, you will be wearing this the rest of your life. <end>

That felt too feminine.At this point, I obviously have to keep this-very-ring because it was "at the ceremony," and yes, I am very proud of it, but if I could do it all over again I'd scrap the comfort fit bulgy-ness and get a lighter, flatter 14k gold ring, purely for comfort issues. 18k gold is heavy!Remember, you will be wearing this the rest of your life. <end>
 B0000AWPMO  18k Yellow Gold 8mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 9 ||	  heavy solid gold band  This is a classic - heavy, shiny, true to size. A pleasure to wear every day. <end>  Sweet! UPDATED  I am getting married in a month and had purchased a "square" ring from another site, which I liked, but just did not look all that square to me (I had seen an awesome, very square, chunky design in the form of a cheap ring at Aldo that I was trying to replicate in some way, even though the ring I ended up with was much subtler).So this "square" ring, at first and even second blush, looked rather...round. Plus, it was a 14k ring, which looked too "silvery" to me, as my skin tone is flattered by Autmn-style colors, needing a richer gold color.So, I decided I'd go where the competition was and go to a round ring. If I couldn't get my square edges, at least it would be chunky and a good deal.I had tried round rings, even comfort fits, on at jewelry stores. They were thin and feminine looking. Clearly they were trying to skimp on the materials, and often they were 14k. I noticed the prices were significant at places like Helzberg, being $400 plus, often $500 or more for a "substantial" ring, a price I was unable to pay.In any event, I decided I would try this ring.Something to note is that once you go from size 10 to 10.5, they add an "extra" 1mm to the ring. So, it goes from 8mm to 9mm. Of course, you are paying additional for the additional metal, but it does make the ring a little more substantial top to bottom once you hit 10.5. I am an 11 so I ended up with a "9mm" ring in my basket.I received the ring today and it's a beauty! HEAVY! Wow, my hand has a whole new heft to it, it feels like. This is MUCH MUCH heavier than the thin 14k squared ring I was sent as above. This ring is pretty hefty. Most anyone would be proud of it.On the inside it's stamped with the obligatory "18k" but also a little infinity symbol, which I thought was a little "spiritual" touch to what is most likely a wedding band for the majority of buyers.The ring sits higher above the finger, so it has a profile and height. It is not like a thin little band that hugs your skin. On me, those looked positively feminine. I hated them and that is why I ran from round rings and wanted a more masculine square one.It slips on easily, is very comfortable to wear and slips off with a reasonable amount of wiggling and cajoling. In other words, perfect. True to size, yet even more comfortable than other rings I've tried. The comfort fit interior is very "pillowy" and smooth. Nice.The heft of this ring makes this a great compromise for me, and the PRICE is FANTASTIC!! Feels like one of those $500 gold rings for much less. THANK YOU, AMAZON!UPDATE Oh man, heaviness is a blessing and a curse. I have now gotten married and have worn this ring for a month now. I sort of wish I'd have gotten a lighter band. I still feel this thing weighing down my finger, i.e. the sensation hasn't "deadened" for me. Not a nightmare, not necessarily annoying, but just a little distracting point.Also, since this ring is comfort fit and "puffs out" (is rounded outwards) a little both on the inside and outside (it's not like a straight "pipe segment"), I feel it on the first bone of my middle and pinky fingers when my fingers are together. A little annoying.Of course, I really wish there were no such thing as wedding bands to begin with, I've never really cared for rings! Why not a bracelet or tatoo?! (Half-joking here, and I digress...)Anyhow, this is a beautiful band. It will start off mirror-finish and will scuff up. Mine is now pretty scratched, both micro scratches and also rock-climbing on our honeymoon put larger, fuzzier scuffs on the ring. This can be refinished at any good jeweler, but I prefer the duller look. I don't like shiny-shiny.

Well, it has been a week and I still haven't received any email.I returned the rings and have to placed another order and put out another 1K (because we were desperate. Our wedding is the following week!) My husband went 1 size down & I went 1 size down from the original chart. We have to pay $12.00 for 1-2 day rush order.The new rings come and once again...they were all SCRATCHED up and dull looking.I am so disappointed in Amazon! You had lost a valuable customer. <end>  Great  Wife loved it. Fit perfectly on her finger and loves the comfort fit so much she hardly knows it is there. A good priced ring and a great ring to have if you do rigorous work with your hands so she says. <end>  Platinum Wedding Band  Super quality for the price. Fits well and shines. Good weight and will never yellow like white gold does. <end>  The perfect platinum band!  My husband bought this band for me for our anniversary and I love it! It was exactly what I wanted...something that I could wear all the time, even while at the gym, traveling, washing dishes, in the yard, etc. The band is the perfect width (2.5mm) and very comfortable. Despite the heavy weight of platinum I forget that I'm even wearing this ring. The comfort fit is awesome-it's super comfy and the slightly rounded edge is very pretty. The inside engraving reads "PLAT 950", nothing else. You won't be disappointed with this ring, especially for the price. (Our local jeweler couldn't find one for less than $800.) <end>

I called Customer Service, Amazon stated that all they can do is to email the Jewelry store and the store will get back to me in 3-4 business days. Well, it has been a week and I still haven't received any email.I returned the rings and have to placed another order and put out another 1K (because we were desperate. Our wedding is the following week!) My husband went 1 size down & I went 1 size down from the original chart. We have to pay $12.00 for 1-2 day rush order.The new rings come and once again...they were all SCRATCHED up and dull looking.I am so disappointed in Amazon! You had lost a valuable customer. <end>
 B0000AWRS8  Platinum 5mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 5 ||	  Great quality  Ordered the ring on 1/23 and received it on 1/25. The quality is Platnum 950 and the fit is perfect.

You can't go wrong with this purchase. <end>  Excellent value for an expensive ring  I wanted a band to match my engagement band and this was the best value for the money..After looking at other sites, Amazon had the Platinum 5mm comfort fit band that I really wanted at such a great price that I took a chance. It came in two days and was exactly the ring I wanted. I know I got a great deal (maybe because I wear such a small size helped) and am very pleased with the ring.

 B0000AWS3L  Platinum 6mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 7 ||	  great band  This wedding band was identical to one I purchased on Blue Nile, but it was $100 less, even with the Blue Nile ring sizer discount. The band looks good and has a decent quality and craftsmanship.(2yr. update 2/27/09  I still have the ring. Yes, I'm still happily married! I rarely take off the ring, so it is scratched and scuffed a bit.I got my first scratch after a week or so and the original shine dulled after a several months (the ring was originally shiny like the picture and still is shiny when I take the ring off an look at the inside). But understand I wore the ring all the time - in the shower, making dinner, mowing the lawn, doing home remodeling jobs, etc.I still feel this was a great buy and I can get the ring repolished anytime but there no reason to do so.) <end>  Great 6mm Plat Band  We looked all over for a man's wedding band in 14K, 18K and platinum . . .and found this plat one to be the best quality and the cheapest . . .All the local dealers quoted us $1100-1300 for the equivalent platinum band . . so this Amazon band was a no brainer! <end>  Excellent Value  Just got mine. I looked all over the place for platinum bands in a size 8. In my family hometown, we had jewelers tell us that the cost would be $1500. In downtown chicago, the prices got better, where they were quoting $800 for the same band but it was here for $600. I ordered it on Saturday and got it on Tuesday, the shipping was free and fast! It looks amazing and is marked PLAT inside. I could not recommend this ring more. If you're a person who prefers to save money, than pay hundreds of dollars more just to say you got the exact same thing at a certain store, then this deal is for you.Please note that you should refer to other expert amazon.com reviews that mention when choosing comfort fit, you should choose a size 1/4 to 1/2 less than your normal ring size. I'm glad I did and it avoided any issues with the size. <end>  Came just as expected  Got this for my wedding, it came on time, and just as advertised. It's a nice plain band, and the comfort fit feels great! <end>
 B0000AWS6L  Men's Platinum 6mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 10 ||	  Great looking band  Was looking for a simple platinum comfort fit wedding band and didn't care about who the designer was. More importantly, I didn't want to pay a couple hundred bucks more for a designer name when I could not tell the two apart anyway.It's a great looking, comfortable band that arrived in a nice little blue box. <end>  Very nice!  I bought this for my upcoming wedding (2nd  P) in April. This ring is very comfortable and looks terrific, as expected. Be sure to order atleast a half size smaller than usual because of the comfort fit. I had to send a size 10 back for a 9.5. This ring is great! <end>  Great Price And Exactly What I Wanted.

 B0000AWSAU  Platinum 2.5mm Comfort Fit Milgrain Plain Wedding Band, Size 5 ||	  This price can't be beat!  I bought the 4mm for my fiance and the 2.5mm for myself. Both rings are stamped "PLAT 950". The craftmanships is awesome, beautifully detailed milgrains. You can't beat this price! <end>  Pleasant Surprise  I just received this wedding band in the mail. It is so nice and very very comfortable. An excellant price for platinum. <end>
 B0000AWSJ6  Platinum 4mm Comfort Fit Milgrain Plain Wedding Band, Size 5 ||	  Better than the ones at the mall  I purchased two of these rings for my wedding, the 6mm and the 4mm. Both of these rings exceeded my expectations. I had looked at dozens of rings at numerous jewelry stores in three different malls and my fiance and I had agreed that we wanted a comfort fit milgrain pattern. Past that, here are a few points 1) THESE RINGS ARE STAMPED PLAT 950  The ring description on the product page does not specify what type of platinum these rings are made of. I took a gamble and ordered them hoping they would be either 95% or at least 90% platinum (the two most common types). To my delight, these rings were both stamped &quot;PLAT 950&quot; which means they contain the highest pecentage of platinum available.2) VERY FINE MILGRAIN PATTERN  The milgrain pattern is quite fine compared to the platinum rings that we saw at the mall. Although I do not have the tools to accurately measure it, I'd say that the grain pattern on either side of the ring does not exceed 0.5mm, probably less. So on the 4mm ring, there is less than 0.5mm of milgrain on either side, and approx 3mm of plain band. It looks very refined.3) IMPRESSIVE FLUID MILGRAIN PATTERN  Platinum is apparently much harder than gold, and the milgrain pattern on many of the rings at the mall appeared etched or scored, rather than giving a smooth organic grain pattern. The rings from Amazon more closely resemble a true milgrain pattern like the kind you'd find on a gold ring. The details appear very organic, even under a 10x loop. Since I was willing to accept the inferior appearance of the rings at the mall, I was quite pleased to see the superior milgrain pattern on the Amazon rings.3) SIGNIFICALTY LESS EXPENSIVE  By purchasing these rings from amazon, I paid approx. half of what I would have paid at the mall.4) FAST DELIVERY  No single store at the mall had the rings we wanted in our sizes. So we would have had to special order them anyway, and most places were asking for a 4 week lead time. So not only were the rings cheaper at Amazon but we got them faster as well.5) SIZING WAS IDENTICAL TO MALL SIZING  My fiance and I had our ring fingers sized at at least 10 different jewelry stores and used those measurements to order our rings from amazon. The measurements were right on. The amazon comfort fit ring fit exactly the same as the comfort fit rings at the mall. Please note however, that when purchasing a &quot;comfort fit&quot; ring, you should order the smallest possible size that will fit. This is because only the middle part of a comfort fit ring will contact your skin, unlike a traditional ring where the two ends of the rings contact your finger. This is what makes these rings comfortable, and also heavier (the middle part has to be made thicker adding wieght to the ring). However this also makes the ring easier to slide off of your finger since the ends don't contact the skin on your finger and consequently the ring doesn't pinch your skin to stop the ring from sliding off. So as a rule of thumb, when ordering a comfort fit ring, get one that is 1/4 to 1/2 ring size smaller than your traditional ring size. If my descrition doesn't make sense to you, at least go to the mall and try on a traditional and a comfort fit ring of the same size. You'll see that the comfort fit slides off of your finger much more easily.In summary, all in all I was a little nervous to order jewelry without first seeing it in person, but I was quite please with the rings once I received them. <end>  Identical to Tiffany milgrain band  Bought the Tiffancy milgrain band ($1250) and this band. After determing that they were nearly identical (and both are 950 platinum), I decided to return the Tiffany ring and keep the Amazon ring.Since this is comfort fit (the middle of the inside of the band is thicker), if you were sized for a traditional fit ring, order 1/2 size smaller. <end>  This price can't be beat!  I bought the 4mm for my fiance and the 2.5mm for myself. Both rings are stamped "PLAT 950". The craftmanships is awesome, beautifully detailed milgrains. You can't beat this price! <end>  Big Bargain, Outstanding Quality  I purchased this ring as a wedding band. I did a lot of shopping both online and in stores, and found that this series of rings from Amazon.com was the best value. The ring is beautiful! The detail of the milgrain is impeccable, and to get a platinum ring at this price is pretty amazing. <end>

It is marked Platinum 950, so do not be afraid to purchase this item even though it is much cheaper than at other jewelry stores or websites. A great value, and an even greater keepsake symbol for your wedding. I highly recommend this ring. <end>
 B0000AWT72  Men's Platinum 6mm Comfort Fit Milgrain Plain Wedding Band, Size 9 ||	  You Won't Find A Better Value  This ring is so beautiful. It's very well-crafted and you get an amazing price for such a great piece of jewelry. I shopped around all over, both online and in stores and found that Amazon.com offered the greatest savings on platinum bands.One word of caution... these rings are comfort fit, so you may have to order a half-size smaller than your normal ring size. I had to return the first ring I got and go for the smaller size, and it fit perfectly! The return was very easy and completely painless.It's easy to be afraid of purchasing an item like his via the internet, but trust me, this ring is completely worth the risk. You'll find similar rings for double the price or more elsewhere, and should you order the wrong size, there's no hassle with the return whatsoever. <end>  Style, Comfort and Price  This will be a life long item which I was able to obtain at an extremely reasonable price. This ring is very stylish and of excellent craftsmanship. I highly recommend this item. The only semi-negative is that the platinum material scratches easily. Although, I just think it gives it more character. Great item! <end>  Beautiful Platinum band!  This ring is absolutely beautiful and an exceptionally great price for a 6mm Platinum ring in size 8. I went to all the retail stores and searched the internet for the best price and Amazon was by far the cheapest for a size 8. I did find another website that sold a size 8.5 which was less expensive than Amazon. I originally bought a size 8.5 from the other website, but returned it since it was too big and then decided to buy from Amazon since the size 8 was cheaper than the other website. The only difference between this ring and the ones sold at the retail stores is that the milgrain edge is thinner/smaller, but other than that it is identical to the more expensive rings sold at the retail stores. I highly recommend anyone looking for a platinum milgrain ring to buy from Amazon. <end>

I was a little nervous about ordering jewelry online but I felt that with the excellent price and Amazon's reputation I could take that chance. This ring is equal to what you would buy in a jewelry store. It has a nice weight for the thinness and a very nice shine. Basically, what you see is what you get.

 B0000AWU7T  14k Yellow Gold 4mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 6 ||	  Stunning!  This ring is stunning, gorgeous. And you can't beat the price!  -) My fiancee wanted gold, I wanted white gold, obviously I "won". But he is more than satisfied with the white gold, this is a very classy-looking ring. <end>  White Gold Ring  This is a nice ring. It is simple and elegant. The price was quite reasonable, when compared to other stores that I searched. I reccomend this ring as a wedding ring for a young couple just starting out. It would be great for a college student's budget. <end>  affordable, classy ring  This ring was well worth the price. It has a lovely shine and fits true to size. It is a very light, thin ring, so it you want something heavy with a thicker consistency to the metal, this may not be for you but as I said it is well worth the price! I'm very pleased. <end>  happy  This item came in only 2 days and in perfect condition! It is a very nice ring - shiny, smooth nice weight/width! Very impressed. <end>  Nice - worth the price  I bought this to wear everyday on my pinkie. It does scratch a bit but is worth the price. <end>  Nice and simple.  We wanted very simple gold wedding bands and we got exactly what we were looking for in these rings (my husband has the 5mm version). We're big on "sentimental value" over "flash", but IMHO, the rings look more expensive than what we paid. Very good value for the money. <end>  BEAUTIFUL RING!!!! NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER  It was exactly as described. Beautiful ring, perfect fit, classy finish. I know I would have probably paid double the price or more had I attempted to purchase similar from a jewelry store <end>  Scratched up in 5 days  While this ring is very comfortable and lightweight, I've worn it less than a week and the ring is in terrible condition. Nothing I've done in the few days it's been worn should have caused so many scratches and nicks (stay-at-home mom). <end>  loved it  it is a beautiful ring. very shiny and classy. my boyfriend loves wearing it. <end>  A Decent Ring For Work  I bought this ring here at Amazon a few years back, after losing my wedding band. I was about to buy two rings to replace the one lost; one would be a nicer ring with the comfort fit and high gloss, and one would be to wear at work, where it wouldn't matter if it got dinged and scraped up.I purchased the "nice" wedding band, which looks almost identical to this one, from a friend who manages a jewelry store. It has the comfort fit (rounding of the edges) and fit perfectly. That ring cost over twice as much as I paid for this ring.This ring I purchased only a few years ago for half of what it costs today to wear as my "work" ring. I didn't want to wear a nice ring to work and get it all scraped and messed up. It was a good decision.This ring does NOT have the comfort fit so you do feel the edges and on occasion they bite a little into your finger. Also, I bought this ring using the very same measurements I got when measured for the nicer ring, and this ring feels about a half size small compared to the nicer ring.All in all, it's held up well and even though it's all scraped up, dinged and dull, it still looks pretty nice on the finger. At twice the price I paid for it, you may be able to find a better deal. But if you are looking for a good second wedding band to work in, you may want to check this one out. <end>  Wedding Band  Ordered this as a replacement wedding band for my husband's lost ring. Great quality for the price -- about $200 cheaper than I could find at local jewelers. It's sleek, shiny and thin so if that's what you are looking for in a men's band--this is the ring for you. <end>  Great Ring for a Great Price  Loved this ring a lot. It is just plain regular ring as you can see in the store, but the Amazon price beat them all. Great value for your money.I know probably you thought that the ring may easily scratched. Well, that's may be true. The thing is there is no ring with this kind of polished (shiny) can be scratch proof.Well, buy this. You won't regret your choice. <end>  Just As it Looks  This ring looks great, it is just as shiny as it looks in the picture. It was true to its size. It was the best price I could find anywhere for this style and width. <end>  WONDERFUL!!  bought as a replacement when i LOST my diamond wedding set..ugg. true to size and wonderful quality! have had it for over a year now and it has held up wonderfully... will recommend to anyone needing a ring! <end>  wedding bands  They are just great, are exactly how i was expected and delivered in time. Thank you very much. <end>  Just what I was looking for  It's a simple band, but it looks great with my engagement ring. I haven't actually been able to wear much it yet to know anything about durability (my wedding is still a month away), but I am very pleased with how it looks. I am also pleased with Amazon's service with this product. <end>
 B0000AWUAF  14k Yellow Gold 4mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 8.5 ||	  Wedding Band  Ordered this as a replacement wedding band for my husband's lost ring. Great quality for the price -- about $200 cheaper than I could find at local jewelers. It's sleek, shiny and thin so if that's what you are looking for in a men's band--this is the ring for you. <end>  Great Ring for a Great Price  Loved this ring a lot. It is just plain regular ring as you can see in the store, but the Amazon price beat them all. Great value for your money.I know probably you thought that the ring may easily scratched. Well, that's may be true. The thing is there is no ring with this kind of polished (shiny) can be scratch proof.Well, buy this.

I am also pleased with Amazon's service with this product. <end>  Stunning!  This ring is stunning, gorgeous. And you can't beat the price!  -) My fiancee wanted gold, I wanted white gold, obviously I "won". But he is more than satisfied with the white gold, this is a very classy-looking ring. <end>  White Gold Ring  This is a nice ring. It is simple and elegant. The price was quite reasonable, when compared to other stores that I searched. I reccomend this ring as a wedding ring for a young couple just starting out. It would be great for a college student's budget. <end>  affordable, classy ring  This ring was well worth the price. It has a lovely shine and fits true to size. It is a very light, thin ring, so it you want something heavy with a thicker consistency to the metal, this may not be for you but as I said it is well worth the price! I'm very pleased. <end>  happy  This item came in only 2 days and in perfect condition! It is a very nice ring - shiny, smooth nice weight/width! Very impressed. <end>  Nice - worth the price  I bought this to wear everyday on my pinkie. It does scratch a bit but is worth the price. <end>  Nice and simple.  We wanted very simple gold wedding bands and we got exactly what we were looking for in these rings (my husband has the 5mm version). We're big on "sentimental value" over "flash", but IMHO, the rings look more expensive than what we paid. Very good value for the money. <end>  BEAUTIFUL RING!!!! NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER  It was exactly as described. Beautiful ring, perfect fit, classy finish. I know I would have probably paid double the price or more had I attempted to purchase similar from a jewelry store <end>  Scratched up in 5 days  While this ring is very comfortable and lightweight, I've worn it less than a week and the ring is in terrible condition. Nothing I've done in the few days it's been worn should have caused so many scratches and nicks (stay-at-home mom). <end>  loved it  it is a beautiful ring. very shiny and classy. my boyfriend loves wearing it. <end>  A Decent Ring For Work  I bought this ring here at Amazon a few years back, after losing my wedding band. I was about to buy two rings to replace the one lost; one would be a nicer ring with the comfort fit and high gloss, and one would be to wear at work, where it wouldn't matter if it got dinged and scraped up.I purchased the "nice" wedding band, which looks almost identical to this one, from a friend who manages a jewelry store. It has the comfort fit (rounding of the edges) and fit perfectly. That ring cost over twice as much as I paid for this ring.This ring I purchased only a few years ago for half of what it costs today to wear as my "work" ring. I didn't want to wear a nice ring to work and get it all scraped and messed up. It was a good decision.This ring does NOT have the comfort fit so you do feel the edges and on occasion they bite a little into your finger. Also, I bought this ring using the very same measurements I got when measured for the nicer ring, and this ring feels about a half size small compared to the nicer ring.All in all, it's held up well and even though it's all scraped up, dinged and dull, it still looks pretty nice on the finger. At twice the price I paid for it, you may be able to find a better deal. But if you are looking for a good second wedding band to work in, you may want to check this one out. <end>

 B0000AWUG1  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 5 ||	  Affordable replacement wedding ring.  After losing my wedding ring this past spring I had wondered how to go about replacing it without having to take out a loan.The ring I got from Amazon fit the bill. For considerably less than I had been quoted at a regular store in our nearest city, I have a replacement that I am proud to have on my finger.The ring arrived well packed and on time. Do not hesitate if you need a budget wedding band this will not disappoint. <end>  Just what I was looking for.....  I needed a plain gold band for when I travelled to areas that my wedding set was inappropriate to wear! This band was perfect and exactly up to the standards I would expect from Amazon. <end>  B-E-A-Utifull  I for one, really love this ring. I'm glad it was able to ship way out here over seas in Japan. It's real shiny and sweet, but if you're not real carefull you tend to scratch it up pretty well. But still, it stays in a wonderful state. I just recommend you take it off before you do any kind of serious work or maintanence of course. Because it will get scratched up....but what jewelry doesn't?!?? ^_^I'm telling friends about it and I'm telling you, for the style, money and look of it you won't be dissapointed. <end>  Nice ring.  I gave this ring 5 stars because it is, in fact, a ring. And I'm still married after five years, so, ya know, that's great, too. <end>

 B0000AWUQX  14k Yellow Gold 6mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 6 ||	  More Than Satisfied!!  I was astonished when I received this ring. The shine, the fit, the color, everything was perfect. I was a little hesitate about buying a ring off of the internet but decided to give it a try and boy am I glad. I had looked in stores and the prices for one this nice were 2 to 3 times what I paid. Even the department store type rings were more expensive and the feel of the ring on the finger was very rough compared to the nice comfortable feel of this ring. The shipping I chose was 2 day but I received it 24 hrs. after I ordered online. It is definitely worth more than 5 stars. Thanks for a beautiful ring!! <end>  Happily SURPRISED!  Was very happyily surprised to see the quality of this product.It was much smoother than the comfort band fits my husband tried on in department stores and a way better value in price.

Was very worth it and we got more than our moneys worth. <end>  Beautiful  An absolutely gorgeous ring at a very fair price. Delivery was very timely. No complaints here! <end>  Same band different song  I highly recommend these 14k gold bands. The price was outstanding. I purchased a couple of 14k gold bands a few years ago and was left making monthly payments. But amazon makes it totally affordable. <end>  Very pleased  The band is simple but elegant. Delivery was timely (even early) and the blue velvet box it came in was a nice added touch. Unbeatable price for a bright, smooth, shiny 14k band. My husband is very choosy about jewelry and a hard to fit size 13 -- the ring was sized correctly, well crafted, and comfortable. He got several compliments the very first day he put it on. A great experience buying jewerly on-line for the 1st time. This ring is sure to satisfy. <end>  Perfect!  It is exactly what I needed. When I showed it to my fiance he smiled and said that it is perfect. <end>  Loved it!  I ordered this ring for my husband for Christmas and he loved it! I was so happy that I was able to find this band in a size 13. I had a hassle trying to find the right size and the RIGHT PRICE!

 B0000AWV9T  14k Yellow Gold 8mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 6 ||	  Absolutely love this ring!  This ring is perfect. I have to disagree with the last review. The color gold is beautiful and it definitely has weight to it. It's durable, thick, and so comfortable to wear. I bought this to replace my diamond wedding ring which I avoid wearing because I am rough with my hands. But this band is just perfect for me, it's beautiful! Thank so much! <end>  I returned it.  The picture of this ring makes it look much thicker like that of a comfort fit band. It is not that thick. The 14k was not very yellow, I think I'd prefer and 18k. I returned it. <end>  A Beautiful Wide Yellow Gold Ring  I am writing to comment on the other reviews for this product and tell you what I see. I received it today and am very pleased with it. It is wider than I expected, and the gold color is nicely yellow - the same as all other 14k yellow gold rings. In the photo of this item it appears to be a bronze color. This is not true, it is bright yellow gold, nicely polished, and very comfortable. The ring has good weight and color and makes a good impression. It is difficult to miss noticing a ring of this width. I bought size 10 and it's a perfect fit. I think this ring will last forever. <end>

I bought this during amazon's Labor Day jewelry sale as a treat for myself, and I'm extremely pleased with the quality and still surprised at the low price that amazon wanted for it. If you go to a jewelry store and ask to see bands like this, you'll see that they charge much, much higher prices.

 B0000AWW63  14k Yellow Gold 5mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 9 ||	  Beautiful Ring  I bought this ring for my fiance as his wedding band for our upcoming wedding. It's a beautiful ring. High quality. The milgrain detailing gives it a unique touch. I am very happy with this purchase. You won't be disappointed. <end>  Exactly as Advertised  The picture of this ring was precisely what I received. After searching on several sites for the one ring I could wear when my bridal set is too much for an occasion, I finally found this one. The quality is exceptional and the presentation was a nice display suspended high on a carpet of black velvet.If a casual but tasteful band is what you are looking for, this is it. The detailing around the edges is so elegant and the gold is so highly polished that it looks like a piece of art. <end>  14k Yellow Gold 5mm milgrain Half Round Band  I bought this for my husband as a replacement for his original wedding band that had to be cut off when he was operated on for carpal tunnel syndrome. He likes it better than his original. I would say this is good testimony after over 17 years of marriage. <end>  Wonderful value  I bought this ring for my fiance for our wedding and it is perfect. It is exactly the same ring we tried on in jewelry stores for double or triple the price. Great workmanship, lovely and shiny just like the picture. Also, I got my band (slightly thinner but otherwise the same) on a different website and they matched perfectly. We couldn't be happier with this purchase and my fiance will proudly wear this forever. <end>  great quality  this ring I bought for my fiancee as a committment to our relationship, and along with my ring both came in beautiful navy blue ring boxes and both polised to glistten like stars. I searched for about 4 months to find the right ring, and it was just as the picture described. The miligrain detailing adds an edge of uniqueness and I could not be happier with the product. Thanks to Amazon. <end>
 B0000AWWXH  14k White Gold 2mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 9 ||	  Gentle elegance  This ring is delicate and comfortable. It feels great on my hand and looks lovely too. <end>  Delicate, but...  This ring is very delicate in appearance and is comfortable, however, the gold is dull and somewhat bronze-like in color.I cannot wear it next to my other white gold jewelry, as it just looks drab. I also have this same band in the 2.5mm width... shinier and brighter and much prettier, without being too wide.I highly recommend the wider version. You'll be pleased with that one. <end>  This was the perfect ring for me!!!  I purchased this ring because I needed something dainty and plain to go along with my engagement ring that is a band with a princess cut main stone and other "floating diamonds". This ring worked absolutely perfectly and I am getting so many compliments! It is so comfortable and looks like it is made to go with my engagement ring. A great find (the 2 mm is hard to find!) and a great deal!!! <end>  Very good quality!  This ring looks great, my husband love it. The fact that it's only 2mm Half Round Band, gives it a very different look. We received in less than two, we were very pleased. A great quality for the unexpensive ring, you could save the rest of the money for the honeymood....as we did!! <end>  purrrfect  I bought this ring because I wanted something lightweight, small, and cheap. I wanted it lightweight so I wouldn't be distracted by it. I wanted it small because as a woman, I do plan on wearing more rings on my wedding finger with my band and engagement ring, so I would like a small band to allow the space. And I wanted cheap because I want a ring for traveling  that is not really too flashy/draws attention, that I won't be too upset losing or getting robbed of, but a ring that will still convey that I am married. This ring does it all. It came in a beautiful box within a box and I was blown away by how much it shined. If you want something like what I've listed, definitely buy this. It's a great great deal. If you want super flashy, go for something different. <end>  So little gold  A mighty small amount of gold for the money. Actually, I returned this ring. It did not match my 14 kt white gold engagement ring. Looked like a different color metal. ALSO...I found this ring in 14 kt. white gold, same mm width at a big blue box retailer & it did match my ring...and for $27.00 and change !!! Weighed exactly the same so why spend more money? <end>  Very thin  Everything was as promised, 14k white gold, sized correctly and very nice, but I had no idea how thin a 2mm width ring is. Imagine uncoiling a paperclip and shaping it around your finger - that's how thin it really is. Other than that, it's dainty, has clean lines and matches my thin engagement ring band. <end>  My wedding ring  I bought this ring as my wedding band to match the engagement ring my now husband had given me. I am very happy with the purchase. The ring itself is beautiful and exactly how amazon described it. Shipping was faster than expected.Overall, very happy with the service and product from amazon.com....THANKS! <end>  dainty  This ring is just what i was hoping it would be. Tiny, and comfortable. <end>
 B0000AWWZJ  14k White Gold 2mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 10.5 ||	  Gentle elegance  This ring is delicate and comfortable. It feels great on my hand and looks lovely too. <end>  Delicate, but...  This ring is very delicate in appearance and is comfortable, however, the gold is dull and somewhat bronze-like in color.I cannot wear it next to my other white gold jewelry, as it just looks drab. I also have this same band in the 2.5mm width... shinier and brighter and much prettier, without being too wide.I highly recommend the wider version. You'll be pleased with that one. <end>  This was the perfect ring for me!!!  I purchased this ring because I needed something dainty and plain to go along with my engagement ring that is a band with a princess cut main stone and other "floating diamonds". This ring worked absolutely perfectly and I am getting so many compliments! It is so comfortable and looks like it is made to go with my engagement ring. A great find (the 2 mm is hard to find!) and a great deal!!! <end>  Very good quality!  This ring looks great, my husband love it. The fact that it's only 2mm Half Round Band, gives it a very different look. We received in less than two, we were very pleased. A great quality for the unexpensive ring, you could save the rest of the money for the honeymood....as we did!! <end>  purrrfect  I bought this ring because I wanted something lightweight, small, and cheap. I wanted it lightweight so I wouldn't be distracted by it. I wanted it small because as a woman, I do plan on wearing more rings on my wedding finger with my band and engagement ring, so I would like a small band to allow the space. And I wanted cheap because I want a ring for traveling  that is not really too flashy/draws attention, that I won't be too upset losing or getting robbed of, but a ring that will still convey that I am married. This ring does it all. It came in a beautiful box within a box and I was blown away by how much it shined. If you want something like what I've listed, definitely buy this. It's a great great deal.

It's inexpensive so it's not taking away from the fund for the expensive wedding band he wants and it gives him something to wear to distinguish him from the "boyfriend" to the "fiance." It's great, has a nice shine, I highly recommend it. <end>  Big Repeated Horrible Problems!  We kept tring to order this ring... we must have sent it back about times... it kept coming back in a 2mm width when we wanted 2.5mm. W ended up not getting it at all. The thign is we already have the other one of the set (the girl's ring) and it s pretty great, so we kept it and now we need to find the mathing men's ring. Very disapointing process.

 B0000AWXNE  14k White Gold 4mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 4.5 ||	  Wedding Band  Ordered this as a replacement wedding band for my husband's lost ring. Great quality for the price -- about $200 cheaper than I could find at local jewelers. It's sleek, shiny and thin so if that's what you are looking for in a men's band--this is the ring for you. <end>  Great Ring for a Great Price  Loved this ring a lot. It is just plain regular ring as you can see in the store, but the Amazon price beat them all. Great value for your money.I know probably you thought that the ring may easily scratched. Well, that's may be true. The thing is there is no ring with this kind of polished (shiny) can be scratch proof.Well, buy this. You won't regret your choice. <end>  Just As it Looks  This ring looks great, it is just as shiny as it looks in the picture. It was true to its size. It was the best price I could find anywhere for this style and width. <end>  WONDERFUL!!  bought as a replacement when i LOST my diamond wedding set..ugg. true to size and wonderful quality! have had it for over a year now and it has held up wonderfully... will recommend to anyone needing a ring! <end>  wedding bands  They are just great, are exactly how i was expected and delivered in time. Thank you very much. <end>  Just what I was looking for  It's a simple band, but it looks great with my engagement ring. I haven't actually been able to wear much it yet to know anything about durability (my wedding is still a month away), but I am very pleased with how it looks. I am also pleased with Amazon's service with this product. <end>  Stunning!  This ring is stunning, gorgeous. And you can't beat the price!  -) My fiancee wanted gold, I wanted white gold, obviously I "won". But he is more than satisfied with the white gold, this is a very classy-looking ring. <end>  White Gold Ring  This is a nice ring. It is simple and elegant. The price was quite reasonable, when compared to other stores that I searched. I reccomend this ring as a wedding ring for a young couple just starting out. It would be great for a college student's budget. <end>  affordable, classy ring  This ring was well worth the price. It has a lovely shine and fits true to size. It is a very light, thin ring, so it you want something heavy with a thicker consistency to the metal, this may not be for you but as I said it is well worth the price! I'm very pleased. <end>  happy  This item came in only 2 days and in perfect condition! It is a very nice ring - shiny, smooth nice weight/width! Very impressed. <end>  Nice - worth the price  I bought this to wear everyday on my pinkie. It does scratch a bit but is worth the price. <end>  Nice and simple.  We wanted very simple gold wedding bands and we got exactly what we were looking for in these rings (my husband has the 5mm version). We're big on "sentimental value" over "flash", but IMHO, the rings look more expensive than what we paid. Very good value for the money. <end>  BEAUTIFUL RING!!!! NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER  It was exactly as described. Beautiful ring, perfect fit, classy finish. I know I would have probably paid double the price or more had I attempted to purchase similar from a jewelry store <end>  Scratched up in 5 days  While this ring is very comfortable and lightweight, I've worn it less than a week and the ring is in terrible condition. Nothing I've done in the few days it's been worn should have caused so many scratches and nicks (stay-at-home mom). <end>  loved it  it is a beautiful ring. very shiny and classy. my boyfriend loves wearing it. <end>  A Decent Ring For Work  I bought this ring here at Amazon a few years back, after losing my wedding band. I was about to buy two rings to replace the one lost; one would be a nicer ring with the comfort fit and high gloss, and one would be to wear at work, where it wouldn't matter if it got dinged and scraped up.I purchased the "nice" wedding band, which looks almost identical to this one, from a friend who manages a jewelry store. It has the comfort fit (rounding of the edges) and fit perfectly. That ring cost over twice as much as I paid for this ring.This ring I purchased only a few years ago for half of what it costs today to wear as my "work" ring. I didn't want to wear a nice ring to work and get it all scraped and messed up. It was a good decision.This ring does NOT have the comfort fit so you do feel the edges and on occasion they bite a little into your finger. Also, I bought this ring using the very same measurements I got when measured for the nicer ring, and this ring feels about a half size small compared to the nicer ring.All in all, it's held up well and even though it's all scraped up, dinged and dull, it still looks pretty nice on the finger. At twice the price I paid for it, you may be able to find a better deal. But if you are looking for a good second wedding band to work in, you may want to check this one out. <end>

 B0000AWY5L  14k White Gold 5mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 9.5 ||	  Pretty much what you'd expect  This is your pretty standard, no-frills ring, which is just what I was looking for. Looks nice, and I liked the amount of thickness it has; it has substance, but isn't clunky.My only complaint is that it *barely* fits on my finger; I'm going to have it stretched either a 1/4 size or an 1/8 size at a jeweler. I'm not sure if that's a measuring error on my part or of the manufacturer, but since I'm not sure I'll dock it one star. <end>  Great ring (for a guy), inexpensive but a little wide...  Buy a plastic ring size set. Wear different plastic rings for a 1/2 hour or so to get the correct size that does not fall off but does not make your finger swell.I bought this for my wedding in the spring of 2006. I wear it every day and it looks fine. Gold is going up because I paid under $100 on amazon. You should not go any wider then this band or it will dig into your finger a little.I wear this ring every day and it has held up fine including getting soap or degreaser on it.I bought "estate jewelery" which means it is used or not a new ring aka "setting" with no stone that was real platinum from a friend and I bought a man made stimulant sapphire stone of 1.5 carrot for my wife and the quality was so good that the jewelery store manager asked me how many carrots it was it looks that real. The stone cost ~ $36 online! Having it mounted and the ring resized cost ~ $300!Guys  don't waste your money on blood diamonds from corrupt countries. Get a top quality CZ or cubic zirconium stone and keep the carrot size to 1.0 to 1.5 qt max (or people won't believe it is real unless you are rich). There is no need to waste money on a platinum ring for the guy - white gold WILL MATCH your brides Platinum just fine and amazon rock! So many crooks in the jewelery industry it is not funny. Btw, walmart sells junk. <end>  Amazon.com your online jewler  If you're worried about quality from Amazon as your online jeweler, don't. Beautiful products top of the line quality! <end>  Exactly what I wanted  The ring was exactly what I wanted and the price was too good to be true. It was beautiful. <end>  Ring  When we saw this ring is was extremely shiny. with thought it had more of a dull finish, but it was so shiny you can see yourself in it. It is not how it looks in the picture. Also the sizing is off. if you are going to order this you'll need to order it about half a size larger than your ring size. <end>  5mm Half Round Band  I love my 14K white gold 5 mm plain half round band! Originally I purchased a 3 mm band and found it too thin so I got the 5 mm instead. I wanted a more substantial feeling and looking band to wear by itself, esp. when I am out for a run or traveling and don't want to worry about wearing my normal 2 (diamond) rings. I would purchase this same ring again. <end>  Nice ring, but sizing is an issue  Ring is all right, but now I have to send it back because the sizing is off. I am possitive that the ring is incorrectly sized as I have other rings in the size I ordered which fit perfectly. Now I have to spend money sending it back to get it exchanged. <end>  Great Buy  I think this ring is a great buy. We had purchased a ring identical to this one at JCPenney and it cost us over $200. Then I found this ring for less than half so we ordered it and returned the other ring. It is just as nice as the more expensive ring. Great for a guy who wants something classic and simple. <end>  Size off by 1/4 of a size  Total ripoff. Cost me additional 70 USD to get the size right. This was no coincidence and almost spoiled the special day for us. Stay away from this... <end>

It is not how it looks in the picture. Also the sizing is off. if you are going to order this you'll need to order it about half a size larger than your ring size. <end>  5mm Half Round Band  I love my 14K white gold 5 mm plain half round band! Originally I purchased a 3 mm band and found it too thin so I got the 5 mm instead. I wanted a more substantial feeling and looking band to wear by itself, esp. when I am out for a run or traveling and don't want to worry about wearing my normal 2 (diamond) rings. I would purchase this same ring again. <end>  Nice ring, but sizing is an issue  Ring is all right, but now I have to send it back because the sizing is off. I am possitive that the ring is incorrectly sized as I have other rings in the size I ordered which fit perfectly. Now I have to spend money sending it back to get it exchanged. <end>  Great Buy  I think this ring is a great buy. We had purchased a ring identical to this one at JCPenney and it cost us over $200. Then I found this ring for less than half so we ordered it and returned the other ring. It is just as nice as the more expensive ring. Great for a guy who wants something classic and simple. <end>  Size off by 1/4 of a size  Total ripoff. Cost me additional 70 USD to get the size right. This was no coincidence and almost spoiled the special day for us. Stay away from this... <end>
 B0000AWY6M  14k White Gold 5mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 10.5 ||	  Pretty much what you'd expect  This is your pretty standard, no-frills ring, which is just what I was looking for. Looks nice, and I liked the amount of thickness it has; it has substance, but isn't clunky.My only complaint is that it *barely* fits on my finger; I'm going to have it stretched either a 1/4 size or an 1/8 size at a jeweler. I'm not sure if that's a measuring error on my part or of the manufacturer, but since I'm not sure I'll dock it one star. <end>  Great ring (for a guy), inexpensive but a little wide...  Buy a plastic ring size set. Wear different plastic rings for a 1/2 hour or so to get the correct size that does not fall off but does not make your finger swell.I bought this for my wedding in the spring of 2006. I wear it every day and it looks fine. Gold is going up because I paid under $100 on amazon. You should not go any wider then this band or it will dig into your finger a little.I wear this ring every day and it has held up fine including getting soap or degreaser on it.I bought "estate jewelery" which means it is used or not a new ring aka "setting" with no stone that was real platinum from a friend and I bought a man made stimulant sapphire stone of 1.5 carrot for my wife and the quality was so good that the jewelery store manager asked me how many carrots it was it looks that real. The stone cost ~ $36 online! Having it mounted and the ring resized cost ~ $300!Guys  don't waste your money on blood diamonds from corrupt countries. Get a top quality CZ or cubic zirconium stone and keep the carrot size to 1.0 to 1.5 qt max (or people won't believe it is real unless you are rich). There is no need to waste money on a platinum ring for the guy - white gold WILL MATCH your brides Platinum just fine and amazon rock! So many crooks in the jewelery industry it is not funny. Btw, walmart sells junk. <end>  Amazon.com your online jewler  If you're worried about quality from Amazon as your online jeweler, don't. Beautiful products top of the line quality! <end>  Exactly what I wanted  The ring was exactly what I wanted and the price was too good to be true. It was beautiful. <end>  Ring  When we saw this ring is was extremely shiny. with thought it had more of a dull finish, but it was so shiny you can see yourself in it.

 B0000AWY8N  14k White Gold 6mm Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  Beautiful Wedding Band  It was worth the wait. When I received this package I could not believe how beautiful the wedding band was. It was much better than many of the other bands I've been shopping for in my area. I would recommend purchasing wedding bands from Amazon.Not only that, paying was easy and I give an A++ for shipping. Very fast! <end>  Great ring!  My fiance and I just ordered these rings for our upcoming wedding, and we are so happy with them. The rings are beautiful, exactly what you would find in a jewelry store for a fraction of the price. (Trust me--we have been to the jewelry stores and know that this is a fraction of the price.) After getting both our wedding bands and my engagement ring from Amazon, I am ready to recommend their jewelry to anyone who asks. We were able to get rings that would have been out of our price range had we been forced to shop at jewelry stores.I didn't get out my measuring tape to make sure that they were exactly 6 mm, but the important thing is that the rings match each other. I can understand that that would be a disappointment if one was trying to make it match a ring one already owns. The person who said the ring was a little small is correct--be careful with the sizing, because my engagement ring, when I had it sized, is supposedly a 6.5 and on the first try, the wedding band I got in 6.5 was a little tight and I had to go up to a size 7. Fortunately, with Amazon, returns are easy and you only have to pay shipping, which is much cheaper than paying the $20 I had to pay to have my engagement ring sized down.For those with concerns about buying wedding bands or an engagement ring from Amazon, fear not; no one can tell the difference between these rings and ones from a jewelry store. The people I've let in on my "little secret" are amazed and say they never would have guessed that our rings all came from online.Everyone should start purchasing their rings from Amazon--the quality is great and the price is unbelievable. My fiance and I couldn't be happier. <end>  A little small...  The ring is beautiful, but the size is a little small. I was sized at more than one local jeweller as a 9, but the ring was much too small. <end>  Overall Nice Band  The shipping was very quick. The band was pretty nice for the price, however when I compared this with a 6mm band from a jewelry store it was not quite as thick. But overall it is a nice band. <end>  Other Reviews Correct  I read all the reviews before ordering this ring along with the 14k white gold 4mm size 6. A lot of other reviewers said that this ring ran small. My soon to be husband and I decided to go ahead and order it large and then just have it sized if it didn't fit. Well, it didn't fit. When we took it to a jeweler it was about a 1/4 of a size smaller than listed. But it looks great, and is very shiny. We had it sized and have no other complaints. <end>  Very nice!!!  Just got married and wanted something that was a little on the thick side... I was under the impression that the ring was going to be smaller based on customer reviews but I figure I would go for it and see for my self. The ring is perfect, very simple, looks very nice and it is just what I expected. <end>  wonderful product  lovely item. but i followed the other customer reviews and ordered a half size up because they said it was sized smaller... well, it was too big.so i ended up sending it back to get my normal size.the quality looks wonderful. <end>  Very nice.  My husband loves this ring. He says it's very comfortable. The sizing isn't to accurate though. It was off by I think 1/4 which was just enough for the ring not to fit. We had it sized rather than return it. This was the second time I had to buy the ring. The first time they sent me a size 12! I had to return it & buy another ring & wait for my money to be refunded. VERY frustrating. I didn't want to have to do the return/buy thing again, that why we just went & had it sized. I figured it would be easier that way. Besides, what if they sent the wrong size yet again? BUT, it is an attractive ring. My husband wears it every day & never takes it off, unlike his old ring. The end result was what we wanted despite the initial headaches. If if wasn't for all the sizing issues I would have given it 5 stars. <end>  Looks great and is worth the money  The ring looks good and is definitely worth the money. The ring is not that comfortable but you get used to it. It is slightly thinner than 6mm but hardly noticeable. It looks great though! You wont find anything better for the price. A good buy. <end>  just as advertised  The ring is quite nice. The real thing looks just like the picture. The size was very slightly small, but close enough. <end>  Great Value  I received this ring quickly and it was just as I expected. It is a great value and nice looking ring. I shopped around at jewelry stores for similar rings, but this is definitely a better value. 14K gold for the price of a 10K ring in jewelry stores. I ordered a larger size than necessary because of other reviews although I am not sure that was necessary because I am now paying to have it down-sized. <end>  very nice  This is a very beautiful ring, very nice for the price. However, it does run small, so I would recommend buying a size larger than you normally would. <end>  not quite  I received the ring in only 2 short days ... fantastic.

 B0000AWZKN  14k White Gold 3mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 8 ||	  Loved it  Really, really comfortable. I never take it off, I wear it in place of my engagement ring and matching wedding band. Since those rings have stones, I am always taking them off to do housework and such. I also use to take them off to sleep. Now I keep them for nicer occasions. <end>  Great Ring - Fits Perfectly  I purchased this ring for my wedding band, and it looks wonderful! We looked at many jewelry stores for suitable rings, and I liked this style the best. But the prices at the stores for this type of ring were at least $150. So I checked amazon.com and found this ring. It arrived quickly and it looks beautiful. One cautionary note -- I originally ordered this ring in a size 5.5, which is the size of my engagement ring, but when it arrived, it was too small. I returned that ring and ordered another one in size 6, which fits perfectly. So if you order this ring, I would order a half-size larger than what you usually need. <end>  14K white gold ring 3mm  I liked this ring it was actually really nice. It was small, but you are looking for something more affordable, and you like white gold this is the ring for you! <end>  excellent value  I ordered this ring to wear with my diamond wedding ring, it just needed a little something extra. The ring looks excellent, adds just a little oomph that my ring needed. And for the price, the value was excellent. Band would be a little too narrow to wear alone, but with another ring it looks (and feels) great. <end>  Beautiful  This is my husband's wedding band. He's had it for two years and it is still as beautiful as the day we got married! <end>  Enchanted  Very pleased with the purchase.... we bought 2 rings, one for my husband, very pleased with the items..... really a great deal for the price.... we love them <end>
 B0000AWZOI  14k White Gold 3mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 11 ||	  Loved it  Really, really comfortable. I never take it off, I wear it in place of my engagement ring and matching wedding band. Since those rings have stones, I am always taking them off to do housework and such. I also use to take them off to sleep. Now I keep them for nicer occasions. <end>  Great Ring - Fits Perfectly  I purchased this ring for my wedding band, and it looks wonderful! We looked at many jewelry stores for suitable rings, and I liked this style the best. But the prices at the stores for this type of ring were at least $150. So I checked amazon.com and found this ring. It arrived quickly and it looks beautiful. One cautionary note -- I originally ordered this ring in a size 5.5, which is the size of my engagement ring, but when it arrived, it was too small. I returned that ring and ordered another one in size 6, which fits perfectly. So if you order this ring, I would order a half-size larger than what you usually need. <end>  14K white gold ring 3mm  I liked this ring it was actually really nice.

 B0000AWZPV  14k White Gold 4mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  I would give this 1.5 stars if I could  My husband did a wonderful job picking out my engagement ring (a 1.75 carat princess cut center stone and two half carat trillion side stones) but I did a poor job picking this as my wedding band. I knew that we would upgrade our wedding bands later on so I picked this one because I thought that it would look fine, it wasn't a big deal, and it would sit nicely with my ring. I'm glad that we didn't purchase two as top and bottom band. Nevertheless, the ring was initially fine but we're in year 3 of our marriage and the ring has turned some bizarre color that looks horrible with my other ring. I've tried getting it cleaned and it'll come back to a relative state of ehh and a week later it'll look ehh again. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this ring....I can only give it a blah. <end>

 B0000AX0DE  14k White Gold 6mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 5.5 ||	  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!  AFTER ONLY TWO MONTHS, MY HUSBANDS WEDDING BAND LOOKS VERY DULL. ALMOST GREEN. THERE IS NO SHINE WHATSOEVER AND IT LOOKS LIKE A CHEAP PIECE OF METAL. I AM SO EMBARRASSED THAT I GAVE IT TO MY HUSBAND ON OUR WEDDING DAY WHICH WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. I WILL HAVE TO HAVE IT RE PLATED OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE IT LOOKS UGLY. SO MY ADVISE IS SPEND A BIT MORE MONEY IF YOU WANT THAT "GOLD" LOOK TO REMAIN BEAUTIFUL AND SHINY LIKE NEW. <end>  i loved it!!!  I BOUGHT THIS WEDDING BAND FOR MY HUSBAND, FOR OUR LAS VEGAS WEDDING. IT HAS HIS FRIENDS DYING OF ENVY. THEY LOVE THE DETAIL AND FIT.THANK! <end>  I'm glad I found this ring  I needed to replace my lost wedding band and I found this ring. My original wedding band was this exact ring. The only difference was the one on Amazon was about half the cost of what local retailers wanted for a 10k version (Amazon 14k!) of the same style ring.I was a little bit hesitant after reading one or two of the other reviews, but now that I have this ring, I thought I had to contribute some positive reviews. I have no regrets as of yet for having purchased this ring. It has not faded or turned my finger green or any of that mess. Just a good ring for a great price. Thanks. <end>  A very nice ring  I don't have a clue what the first 2 reviewers were talking about, the ring i got was exactly as advertised, a nice 14k 6mm Milgrain cut ring. I ordered the 5mm which was a nice ring as well, just felt like i wanted a 6mm size after seeing that the 5mm was a little too dainty for me so i returned to 5mm size. Nice ring, would highly recommend. <end>  IT IS GETTING DARK  THE RING THAT I BOUGHT IS GETTING DARK, I GOT MARIED ONE MONTH AGO AND THE RING ITS GETTIN UGLY, DARK, DOESNT HAVE SHINE ANY MORE..IS IT WHITE GOLD??? I DONT THINK SO... IT WAS A BAD CHOICE... <end>
 B0000AYMWN  14k Yellow Gold Pinwheel Earrings ||	  Mom-in-law RAVES about them!  My husband and I purchase these as his mother's Christmas gift, and she was so pleased! She said they were larger than she expected, and show up just beautifully on the ear. We were very happy with her reaction! <end>  wearing with pleasure  I am extremely pleased with my purchase of these earrings. They are just as depicted! <end>
 B0000AYNV4  14k Yellow Gold Checkerboard Faceted Amethyst (16x12mm) Ring, Size 7 ||	  Gorgeous!!  It is little bit too big of a stone for my long cylinder finger, but I love it. The color is very rich and dark that goes with thick YG. It catches people's eyes. I recommended it is a keeper. PR in Hillsboro, OR. <end>
 B0000AYO6X  14k Yellow Gold Blue Chalcedony (12x10mm) Ring, Size 6 ||	  Substantial and beautifully made ring.  I was extremely pleased the moment that I opened the ring box. The gold is thick and perfectly formed, and the stone is gorgeous and clean!What an amazing deal, this is a very high quality ring. <end>  Clean and elegant  This ring lets the stone shine. A beautiful turquoise color - it will go with all your tourquoise pieces. It has a very clean and elegant look. I've ordered all the matching pieces to go with it. <end>
 B0000AZ0Y9  14k Yellow Gold 4mm Round Emerald w/ Diamond (HI-I1-2 0.02ctw) Stud Earrings ||	  emerald & diamond earrings  I ordered these earrings as a gift. They came in and are so pretty I want to keep them! Nice green stones too in a sturdy lined box. <end>
 B0000AZ0ZI  14k Gold 4mm Square-Cut Precious Stone Stud Earrings ||	  Lots of imperfections, but still nice.  These are pretty little earrings. They look nice if you are going casual. Both of my stones matched nicely, they are a pretty good size, and I have enjoyed wearing them. However, expect to to see a lot of imperfections in the stones. They also have a cloudy color, not the beautiful vibrant green one associates with emeralds. If I had paid a lot of money I would have returned them, but for well under $100 they are great. I feel that the imperfections should be expected at this price range. <end>  Not So Pleased...  I purchased these based on the reviews and description, but was so disappointed. The settings were fine, but the stones are very light-colored, very clouded and have very visible flaws. They look much more like Jade, not emeralds. I have ordered other similar items from Amazon and have been pleased, but not with these. I really wanted a pair this size, but will be sending these back. Hope you have better luck! <end>  beautiful green gems!  I've been wearing these earrings pretty much every day since they arrived. This is a great buy. Ive had them appraised since I've received them and well...lets just say I got a GREAT deal! <end>  Returned  Not great. Returned these because they were an odd color and very tiny. Have been very happy with other earring purchases from amazon so tried these, but definitely not worth the price. (really don't look like emeralds!) <end>  Buying while on sale creates a great bargain  Just received these. Bought them as a gift while they were on sale. Nice sturdy settings, evenly colored stones, sized big enough to see easily but not so big as to be loud or clunky. Photos are very accurate representations. <end>  Good value  I bought these as a gift for my little sister, who, at turning 22 is now old enough to start a 'fine' jewelry collection. These are a great starter, allowing her to "figure out" how to care for and clean sensitive stones without a high replacement cost if something were to happen. To be honest, I didn't have very high hopes for the quality of these stones due to the very, very bargain price I paid, but WOW, these were far superior to many "Name Brand" emerald studs I'd been considering for 4x the price.Yup, there are inclusions (mostly a very small white vein running through both stones) but, hey, these are natural emeralds. That was to be expected. The setting is solid and attractive, the stones a VIBRANT green, and the cut on the emeralds modern but classic.These probably wont be a piece that will be handed down through generations, but, for the money, I think they are more than satisfactory.Only giving this a "4" because one of the prongs was bent on arrival. This was easily fixed using a jewelers loop and some cotton-covered needle-nosed pliers (as to not scar the soft gold surface.) 5 minutes and the pair looked perfect. <end>  PLEASANTLY SUPRISED!  For $30 I wasn't sure what I'd be getting but I was pleasantly suprised. The setting is solid and the stones are a very pretty green. The color is very consistent. Not too cloudy, streaky or spotted like you might expect. They are also bigger than I expected. I'm very happy with them. <end>  loved it  I thought the earings were a great buy. They looked great. The packaging could have been better and with some more information regarding origin of stone, manufacturing etc. Overall very pleased with them. <end>  My Wife loves them  They are kind of light in color, which is normal for man made emeralds I guess - my wife loves them though! <end>  just ok  the prong is soo thin. its ok i dont really like it, i wont recommend it to others tho,,,it look cheap also... <end>  Nice earrings for the price!  At this price point, I didn't expect the world's greatest emeralds considering how expensive they are, but the emeralds I received were nicer than I expected. Slight inclusions, nice medium green color throughout (I prefer lighter color emeralds rather than the dark ones) and set in 14K gold. I was very pleased with them and recommend them. Maybe it depends which ones you get since so many have been negative, but I have no complaints. <end>
 B0000AZ0ZK  14k Yellow Gold Heart-Shaped Blue Topaz Stud Earrings ||	  A Very Satisfied Customer  -)  These earrings are exactly as pictured. I was very happy when I opened the box and found the quality that I was looking for. As this blue topaz stone is the birthstone for December, (my birthmonth)I have been searching for a pair of earring such as these. For future buyers  The stone is a very nice size-not too big to be gawdy, but not to small to look like a child's earring. It is also a light to medium blue color and has a nice clarity. Also, the setting is a bit raised (as you can see by the photo) so if you're looking for an earring that sits flat against your ear, these are not for you. As for myself, I actually like the raised setting so I find them perfect. Definitely true 14K yellow gold and a very good buy for the price. Hope this review helps! Happy Shopping  -) <end>  Very Pretty!  These are very pretty earrings. Setting is sturdy and well made; prongs are secure. Backs fit tightly. Stones have a nicely matched, good, bright color with sparkle. Heart shape of stones is well-defined, but one stone was not cut quite as well (a little crooked on top). I paid about $35. I would buy these again. <end>  What a bargain!  I bought these for my wife as a gift. Our son is a December baby, so they were actually marked from him ;)They here larger and more brilliant than I expected! My wife is VERY pleased!Amazon ships fast, and packaged very well.Thanks again! <end>  Given as a gift  I got these earrings for my niece's 15th birthday. She loved them and they were very pretty. They shined nicely and the gold went very well with them. Thanks amazon. <end>  Beautiful, nice quality, decently priced heart-shaped stud ear rings.  For me, the metric for success is how my wife resonds.She loved these ear rings for Valendine's Day and that says it all.If the color, shape, and style suit her then go for it.They're quite decent ... recommended. <end>  14 k yellow gold heart shaped stud earrings  Beautiful earrings recieved them in a timely manner and was packaged wellI would buy these earrings again <end>  Nice stones but can't tell shape easily  The stones are nice quality but the cut is such that they look like they are trillium cut instead of heart shaped. If you really want heart shaped, these aren't the ones for you. <end>
 B0000AZ0ZQ  14K Yellow Gold 6mm Round-Shaped Blue Topaz Stud Earrings ||	  Perfect Valentine's Gift  These are beautiful! I was very reluctant to order jewelry online, but these are so much more beautiful in person. The shine of the blue topaz is amazing. Larger stones than I am used to, but I know my girlfriend will love them. Plus, for the price ($43) they are an amazing gift to someone you love when money is tight. I am very pleased with the quality. <end>  nice earrings, but post was slightly bent on one and the backs are not very good  I like these earrings, but the post on one was slightly bent. The backs on these are flimsy and very small; however, I've noticed that is becoming fairly standard on a lot of earrings. <end>  Beautiful! great value!  I ordered these and rec'd them the NEXT DAY (I was in shock!) and upon opening the package up, I was struck by how beautiful the shade of blue is, the size is perfect to make an impact but not weigh too heavily on anyone's ear lobe; and the sparkle and clarity of each stone is just gorgeous. A serious  "WOW!". What a spectacular value for the price of $42!!! <end>  very pleased  The earings arrived earlier than expected! They are really lovely, the color is just as pictured. I am very happy with this purchase they are worth much more then the 42.00 I paid. <end>  something new, something blue  I bought these earrings as a wedding gift and they are very beautiful. Nice size and nice package. I will be happy to make my contribution to the old saying "Something old, something new . . . <end>  14k 6mm Blue Topaz Studs  Bought these for my Daughter for Christmas. Nice blue stones, good size and free shipping with Amazon. I know she will like them. <end>  Topaz Studs  I love my blue topaz earrings! They're exactly what I wanted! They're just the right size. They arrived so quickly and in impecable condition. Amazon, you're still the best - keep up the good work! <end>
 B0000AZ104  14K Yellow Gold Three Prong 6mm Trillion Citrine Stud Earrings ||	  Love earrings!!  I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law. She is very picky about her jewelry so I was nervous up until I received the earrings. They are very beautiful. My mother-in-law was very pleased and is thrilled that she has already received comments on them. GREAT purchase!!!! <end>  Soooooooooooo Pretty!!!  I love these earings. The citrine stones are cut beautifully and they have a great sparkle to them. The box they come in is very nice and, overall, they look much more expensive than they are. Highly recommended!!! <end>
 B0000AZ10B  14k Yellow Gold Four Prong 6x4mm Oval Amethyst Stud Earrings ||	  Really gorgeous  These earrings are a gift for the upcoming holidays. I think the person receiving them will really like them.They are a great color and are a nice size. I would totally recommend these. <end>  great  very good for everyday wear or dressing up <end>  Very nice stones  Nice for the price but smaller than the picture may lead you to believe. <end>  Cool Earrings  The shape and quality of these earrings are great. I would buy them again. <end>
 B0000AZ1EE  14k Yellow Gold 4x3mm Oval Sapphire and Diamond (H-SI2 0.06ctw) Ring, Size 7 ||	  I would give it less than one star if I could  I bought one of these for my mom--Mother's Day present. She loved it. A few months later I learned that a stone had fallen out of it. Too late to return it to Amazon, so I bought her another one. The very same day I gave it to her, the exact same stone had fallen out and was lost. These rings are cute but the fact that the same stone falls out with minimal wear tells me they are not well put together.I have purchased inexpensive rings from Amazon before and never had this problem. <end>  Lovely Ring-Great Price!  This ring is absolutely beautiful. The picture does not do it justice; the sapphires are a deeper, dark blue that offsets the diamonds beautifully. My only complaint is the limited size availability as I had to have mine resized. <end>
 B0000AZVU4  18k White Gold Round Diamond J-Hoop Earrings (1/2ctw, H, SI2) ||	  Xmas present  I have just received this earring and I am planning on surprizing my wife with it. My first impression was that the stones are so small compared to the picture shown (I wonder what the 1 ct look like) and that the diamonds are not that brilliant even when viewed in the sun. I'll let my wife decide if she would rather have the larger diamonds after Xmas. <end>
 B0000AZVUA  18k White Gold Round Sapphire (4.5 mm) w/ Round Diamond (0.02ctw) Pendant, 18" ||	  Dazzling  I recently purchased this pendant although I was skeptical as to whether I should purchase jewelry online. It is nothing short of dazzling. The sapphire sparkles beautifully in any light and truly grabs your attention. <end>
 B0000AZW4R  14k White Gold Polished Cross w/ Beaded Ends on 18" White Gold Chain ||	  Beautiful Cross, weak chain  The cross it's self was gorgous but the chain was very thin. I chose to buy a diffrent chain to hang the cross from before I gave this as a gift. I wore the chain with out any charms on it and it broke with in a week. <end>
 B0000AZW50  14k Yellow Gold Solid Cross on 18" Yellow Gold Chain ||	  Very nice cross  The cross is very nice and a nice weight. The chain could be thicker but it is a nice package for the price <end>  14k Solid Gold Cross  This cross is very nice quality!Great for a man as well on a rope chain, etc.The chain included is not very heavy... <end>  Very nice cross...perfect for Protestants  As an episcopalian, I wanted a plain gold cross- nothing gaudy. However, I wanted one of substantial weight and solid. This cross fills the bill perfectly.One caveat- you will need to buy a chain. The flimsy one supplied is a throw-away. I suggest the chain amazon sells for $80 (same price as the cross) which is a box design. It looks great with the cross. <end>  Very Solid  A very solid piece of jewelry. I bought it for my husband and he is very pleased with the quality of the cross. <end>  14K yellow Gold Cross 1.25" by 0.63"  The cross is very nice and you get all the boxes just like the pictures Amazon provides. The chain that comes with it is very light weight and has real small links. The chain is OK but a heavyier chain would have been nicer. That would raise the cost though.I give the cross 5 stars and for the chain take one away. <end>
 B0000AZW59  14k White Gold .12ctw Diamond Cross on 18" White Gold Chain ||	  14k White Gold .12ctw Diamond Cross on 18" White Gold Chain  This was a little smaller thatn i thought, but my neice still love the necklace. It was given as her graduation present. Thanks <end>
 B0000AZW5I  14k White Gold Fleur-de-Lis Style Cross on 18" White Gold Chain ||	  Nice quality  Nice quality, but as usual, the chain is rather skimpy. But for the price, I would expect this. Nice detail. <end>
 B0000AZW5X  14k White Gold Petite Heart Framed Cross w/ Diamond Accent Center on 18" White Gold Chain ||	  petite  This item is pretty but very small. I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter, but I feel it would be too small for me to wear. There are diamonds, but they are barely visible. <end>
 B0000B10DM  Sterling Silver Open-Center Button Earrings ||	  Nice Surprise  This is the first time I have ordered jewelry online. Their picture looked nice and I thought I would take a chance for the low price. I was very pleased with them. They are much larger than I expected; I thought they would turn out to be tiny! Only problem was the clasps were on extremly tight and I bent the post on one of them in trying to get it off. off. I am using other posts that I had but they are not sterling silver and don't look as good as the others. All in all, a good first-time jewelry buying experience. <end>
 B0000B10FB  Sterling Silver Line-Hinged Hoop Earrings ||	  Solid and Sturdy Earrings for Daily Wear  I have these earrings and I love them. They are solid and sturdy and wonderful for every day wear. The add just enough of a dressy feel to a casual outfit that they can be worn from work to dinner and still have you looking sharp.They are well made and easy to care for as well as heirloom quality. A great buy. <end>  Excellent Quality For Sterling Silver!  Often sterling silver cuff earrings are thin and flimsy sheets of sterling silver. These are a nice, quality weight without being overly burdensome on those ear lobes!These earrings are well worth the list price and if they are being sold for less, snatch them up! I bought four pairs for gifts and everyone has loved and adored them (and they thought I spent way more than I did!) <end>  casual, yet nice  It;s funny, I have turned these into my everyday earrings. I didn't mean to. They go with everything, and I have twin 15 month old twins that don't try to yank at them.They are sturdy, and plainly nice. <end>  Great Buy!!  These earings are a super value. Very high quality sterling silver earing at a super price. As other reviewers have noted, they look great with both casual and evening wear. I have received numerous compliments on these earings and have considered buying several pairs as gifts as another reviewer has done. In short, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. <end>
 B0000B357U  14k White Gold Hearts w/ Yellow Gold Bars Stampato Bracelet, 7" ||	  Clasp never worked right  It kept falling off, I loved it so much I just kept it, now I lost it on vacation in Las Vegas and I am very very upset. Its gone now forever, I feel as if I left my heart in Vegas now. Thats probably why they stopped making it!Janine in NY <end>
 B0000B3586  14k Yellow Gold Mini Heart Stampato Bracelet, 7" ||	  The wish list really works!  I put this item on my wish list thinking it would be a reminder more for me than anyone else, but when my mom sent me an Amazon e-card, the wish list popped up and she ordered me the bracelet! High five to a great mom!  )The bracelet is very feminine without being too dainty...it has a nice presence on the wrist without being too obvious. The hearts alternate from a satin finish to a polished finish which gives texture and depth, also creating an illusion of two-tone gold. The round jump rings from heart to heart remind me of the metal ring belts, so it has a contemporary look as well. The stampato finish on the back is smooth and extremely comfortable. The back has a nice look to it also, which is good because occasionally I find the bracelet has turned itself over on my wrist, and the underside is showing (thus only 4 out of 5 stars).This is one of the cheaper stampato link bracelets available, so it is more affordable, but only the purchaser will know since this looks as though it would cost much more.Thanks again mom...YOU ARE THE BEST! <end>
 B0000B35CH  14k White Gold Perfect Fit Earrings ||	  Not-Quite-Perfect Fit  I had these earrings on my wish list and received them as a gift. They are light-weight and comfortable, but I was disappointed to find that the front of the hoop tends to tilt forward, exposing the hinge and part of the post. The post is fairly long, 11 mm from the hinge to the catch, compared with 8 mm on another pair of hoops that I like better. These earrings might be better for someone with thick earlobes. <end>  Versatile and well-made  These have quickly become my favorite pair of earrings. They look substantial when worn, but they are lightweight and comfortable. They go well with either silver or white gold necklaces. They are shiny and have a classic appearance. Plus the snap bar locks them securely in place. Buy them and you won't be sorry! They also make a great gift item! <end>  Lost Earring Replaced by Amazon  These were nice earings, which I received as a gift off my wish list. But after I wore them about 3 or 4 times, one of them fell out and is now lost. The post does not stay in place very well. I am frustrated because I put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an "innovative clasp" which avoids lost earings. But they did not work well for me.By the way, after I first wrote this review, I called Amazon to complain. They sent me another pair right away at no charge. This suggests to me that others have complained in the past. I appreciate that they were so responive. <end>  I guess my earlobes must be fat...  ...'cause these earrings fit me perfectly (hence the product name!) While previous reviews on this product made me hesitate on purchasing these earrings, I'm glad I went ahead 'cause I know that I've found a new regular pair of earrings (at an additional 30% off due to good timing on a Monday sale!) <end>  I agree  Satisfaction wh reservations  I agree with most of the reviewers. I have a pair in yellow gold which initially didn't fit perfectly. I gently bent the earring to tighten the earlobe width and was able to improve the fit. It worked for me, but make your own decision to carefully, lightly bend the earrings because they are obviously hollow and could crimp. I agree that the clasp does not seem particularly secure, although I have not had any problems. The earrings are very, very light-weight, thus very comfortable. If they fit you, they are very handsome. <end>  Not So Perfect  Upon receipt, I noticed one earring had residue on it as if a label had been removed. These earrings are nice, but rather thin in weight and certainly NOT a perfect fit. I am not confident about the clasp which is rather thin. As another reviewer mentioned, the earrings sit on the ear leaving the post somewhat visible so these will be returned. <end>  beautiful  this was well packed and came in a box with a tiny bag and inside the earrings. they are beautiful =) love it. =) <end>  elegant  I bought these earrings for my wife because she was looking for some small gold earrings. These earrings are very elegant and the quality is very nice. The only complaint that I've heard about these earrings is that the clasp on one of them comes undone easily. Overall, this item was a great purchase! <end>  Really Cute  I have to say that these are really nice earrings. Now bear in mind I brought these earrings for tweens that wanted something a little bit older and stylish.I have to say I brought another pair just for myself. These earrings are really nice and about 3 fourths of a inch big. If you are looking for larger look into their collections this is great as a gift as well as a nice thinking of you peasant. <end>  Wobbly  These are a nice size, yet they sit strangely on my ears. They look like are always falling off. I probably wouldn't purchase them again. <end>  I prob would've passed on these in person  I don't believe these earrings hang the way the design intended. There is a gap between the front end of the earring and the ear. Looking back at the side view pic now I can see how that happens considering where the center of gravity appears to be. These nuances did not seem to bother the person for whom I bought them so if she was happy, then I was happy. The earrings look like they cost more than they did. <end>  Should have listened to the rest.  A gift to my wife "just because" she loved the way they felt and weighted not how they "creep up" and stay there. She does not use them as much as she would like. Don't buy them you will be sad  ( <end>  EAR RINGS  this is a grad. gift for our daughter and I'm sure she will love them THANKS <end>  Elegant, but...  I looked forward to receiving these earrings in the post and wasn't disappointed until I tried them on! They never stayed in place at all they kept tilting forward exposing the post and hinge. <end>  14k White Gold Perfect Fit Earrings  great stuffs and never regret to have them. also very fast in S/H.love to do business with you again. <end>
 B0000B35CT  14k Yellow Gold and Silver 3mm French Rope Necklace, 18" ||	  POOR QUALITY  I am a frequent Amazon jewelry shopper and have been delighted with the quality of all items I have purchased, EXCEPT FOR THIS NECKLACE. It broke within a week of purchasing it. One day I was wearing the necklace and all of a sudden it slipped off my neck. Apparently, the ropes unraveled from each other and fell out of the metal collar located next to the clasp. My jeweler told me it was not worth fixing. <end>  Needs 'real' picture  The rope is heavy, thick and well-made. The 14K yellow gold is deceiving because there is one single thread of gold - not one braid - that runs through it. The picture is deceptive. <end>  necklace  The necklace I ordered was beautiful.Very heavy in weight and very well made.A little shorter than i expected but was still nice.Well worth what I paid for it. <end>  a real gem!  I love this necklace especially the price. It is so deceiving to look at on the screen. It is beautiful.It shimmers! i should have bought one for each one of my daughters! <end>  Great Product  Great necklace. It's an eye catcher. Fits well for average build guys. Might seem a bit small for well built blokes. It's been subjected to a lot of wear and tear and it's as it is. Total value for money. <end>  GREAT DEAL  I purchased this chain for my husband for Fathers Day. I was really impressed with the look and quality of this necklace. It was a lot heavier than I expected and very well made. I was hoping he would not like it just so he would give it to me!! HA One thing though, he says its just a little tight so a 20" might be better for a man but he still loves it and wears it daily. <end>
 B0000B35DA  Duragold 14k Gold Hoop Earrings, (1.4" Diameter) ||	  great quality  I don't know how many times my baby has ripped these hoops out of my ears but they have stayed in tact, no fading, no bending. They're great earrings. Now my earlobes on the other hand..... <end>  14K Yellow Gold Round Hoop Earrings  I thought they would be a little thicker, but they are still beautiful. <end>  Nice for the price I got them for  These are good quality gold earrings with a secure clasp. I really do not feel that they are large at all as one reviewer here states. They are more on the small size for what the styles are these days. I payed $80.UPDATE Jan. 2012 I have worn these nearly every day since purchase and they have worn beautifully and still look new. <end>  GOLD HOOPS  I love them. I wear them everyday to work. Although large in size, they are light weight and comfortable to wear. <end>  Wife loves them!  This is the 2nd pair I've gotten for my wife, she has the smaller 3/4 inch ones as well. These are great earrings for the price, beautiful color, good craftsmanship, sturdy locking mechanism and most of all they look gorgeous on her!This is a great present for an in between surprise. <end>  Great for every day wear! Not too big for the office!  These earrings are just what I wanted! Lightweight. It's true that when you fasten them, you shouldn't "click" the post down into the clasp, it's better to gently insert the post into the clasp. I love 'em! <end>  Smaller than expected  These are beautiful earrings, but they are smaller than I expected. I measured them, and they are exactly the diameter that was advertized, but the picture does not match the actual earrings. In the picture, they look skinnier and therefor bigger. In reality, they are proportionately thicker for their size. I am fine with the size and thickness, but it was a surprise. <end>  Exactly what I was looking for  I was looking for a good sized gold hoop for not a lot of money and I found it with this earring. They're large enough to be noticed through long hair and are perfect for either casual or dressy outfits. I agree with the other reviewers regarding the clasp, be careful when opening and closing but it's definitely secure once clicked into place. Great value for the money. <end>  good buy  My wife has a problem with earrings because she needs a small prong. I ordered her other earrings but I had to return them because they hurt her ears. These were a nice change because she can wear them without the pain. Plus she loves them. <end>  Love these!  I own a Duragold bracelet that I wear everyday for 12 years now and absolutely love. I also took advantage of the lifetime warranty to get it repaired this year and I had no problem. The earrings are light and just what I wanted for everyday wear. THey don't come off at bedtime. There is no need. I wish they were not so expensive but that is what you pay for a product as fine as Duragold. <end>  Great hoops!  The earrings were just what I expected and wanted in size and weight. They are lightweight, but that is what I needed. The clasps snap into the back and feel secure. The color is lovely, and I can wear them with whatever I want. I'm very pleased with my purchase! <end>  Good choice for $60  I was a little hesitant about this purchase. It turned out to be like the Sam's Club ones I had been looking at, but cheaper. And I do like the locking "click". <end>  awesome  just the right size for casual or work. look great,have thoroughly enjoyed!! will purchase white gold as well.terrific buy!!!!not too long or too short. would look great with short or long hair. <end>  Very nice  Just the size I was looking for. My wife really liked them a lot. They look as good as a pair I paid much more for from a jewery store. <end>  Well made, simple yet timeless  I knew my wife needed some everyday hoops, so I bought these for her for our anniversary. They look well made, and after a month of almost daily wear, there's 0 marring of the gold, no sign of wear 'n' tear. Given the high price of gold right now, these were a good buy if you're looking for some hoops that will last a long-time. <end>  Just right  I have purchased so many hoops. Too flimsy, too heavy, too large or small and on and on. The 1.5" is the perfect size for me. The important thing in all hoops is to find the right size and width first. Good thing I read other reviews about the snap lock closure though or else I might have had a problem. These have a nice shine to them and are very pleasing to the eye. At first glance I didn't think these would be noticeable on but they are and very simple yet elegant. Another important factor is that they are light. I will be wearing these frequently. Great buy!!! Thanks Amazon. <end>  just right  It's "perfect", she said! On the other hand, I expected it to be "meatier"! Having no experience at purchasing an earring I relied heavily on the picture and not the detailed specifics! Now I know what to expect vs the number of grams! Still I am ecstatic by the results! Thank-you Amazon! <end>  Excellent earrings!  I was so pleased with these earrings...the price, the quality and the good snap closure. I am very pleased! Excellent value! Debbie <end>  Exceptionally Nice Earrings For the Price  I am very pleased with these earrings. They are a nice size and great quality for the price. My only concern has been with the wire that fits through the ear. It seems a little light weight, and actually bent a little the first time I put them on. <end>  Gold Hoop Earrings  Cute earrings great size for late night outing or work! Just what I've been looking for very, very, pleased! <end>  Classy standard must-have  These are nice quality basic hoops. Fastening is secure and I must say I listen for the small click. They are an excellent size; seems like they are made to be of a slimmer tubing, but overall a fair size so they can be seen through long or short hair. They are light and comfortable to wear, and the gold is classy. Every earring person needs hoops and these will certainly get a lot of wear. <end>  Great quality and deal!  This earring is great for the quality and price both. I found this is the best price in this gold quality hoop earrings you can find on the website. on amazon, there are so many jewelry companies and can find many many hoop earrings, but I can trust this "amazon collection" is the best so far. also they are free shipping system and so fast delivery. I will continue to search and buy more from "amazon.com collection" jewelry. Thank you. <end>  Love Them  I love these earrings. I love the fact I can hear a click when I fasten them. I have lost several pair of gold earrings in the past. Love Them!! I did not rate five stars because I thought they would be a little heavier. <end>  Love These Earings!  These earings are great! I have sensitive ears but I don't even know I'm wearing them and they look great too! A nice size, but not too big. I highly recommend them <end>  Not ever real Gold  I bought these hoop earings as a gift and was so embarresed when my girlfriend opened them. They were cheap, flimsy, and obviously not real gold. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Thank goodness Amazon is so good about handling returns! <end>  Wife loves them  Received the day before Christmas. They are the Perfect size for her small face and light enough for her to wear regularly <end>  Good product  I gave this as part of my wife Christmas. She loved them and wears them often. The locks works good and securely. <end>  Pretty.  These were a gift to myself. They're a little thinner and smaller than I expected, but that's probably more because I didn't read the description accurately than a reflection on the product itself. Otherwise, they're very pretty and I wear them almost every day. <end>  Wears them all the time  Wife loves them. Clasps appear and feel fragile but no problems so far. A solid purchase for a little surprise. <end>  Beautiful earrings!  I got these for my Mom as a Christmas gift. In her words they were,&#34;The perfect size&#34;. When I told her there was a lifetime warranty and they were solid gold, she was ecstatic! <end>  They work  These are nice and I wear them often, nice size, nice feel. I thought they were a little pricey, reason for 4 stars <end>  I thought they would be bigger  When I received my earrings, I was kind of disappointed. I guess the picture really made them look bigger than they are, but other than that I am satisfied with them. I wear them every day. So they are growing on me.  0) <end>
 B0000B35DG  14k Yellow Gold Round Hoop Earrings ||	  Beautiful, elegant and a good value  These really look as though they cost a lost more than they do. I get compliments every time I wear them. They are so nice, I bought a pair for my sister. They make a terrific gift. <end>  Gold Hoop Earrings  The diameter of this item was listed as "interior 40mm". The 40mm diameter measurement is from outside edge to outside edge, not interior. The interior diameter is 32mm. <end>
 B0000B35DR  Duragold 14k Yellow Gold Mirrored Ball Hoop Earrings ||	  A welcome addition to my collection.  I liked this pair of earrings so much, when I discovered the slightly larger pair with three mirrored gold balls, I knew I had to have them as well. After reading the review of the larger pair by Mark Allen Rogers, I was persuaded and convinced to make the purchase...thanks, Mark. <end>  kool hoops  I think these hoops are of high quality and would look good on anyone. <end>  Compliments Galore  I get compliments on these earrings every time I wear them, with people mistaking the balls for little stones. They are extremely light weight, and feel insubstantial. They do the trick, but do not feel like a quality earring. <end>
 B0000B35DU  Duragold 14k Yellow Gold Mirrored Bead Hoop Earrings ||	  Yet another addition to my collection  I already own the smaller single mirrored gold ball pair of earrings and like them so much that, when I discovered the slightly larger pair with three mirrored gold balls, I knew I had to have them as well. After reading the review of the larger pair by Mark Allen Rogers, I was persuaded and convinced to make the purchase...LOL...didn't really take much convincing, but...thank you any way Mark. <end>  Nice product for the money!  These earrings are an excellent purchase for the money. This was my first jewelry purchase over the internet, and I was very pleased. A very nice presentation box was included with detailed care information as well as return information. This gift was an excellent purchase and was combined with the 14k Yellow Gold Hoop Earring w/ 1 Mirrored Ball (which is a smaller hoop). This has an excellent effect for those who prefer to wear two earrings on each ear! <end>  Gift  My wife loved these earrings! I gave them as a Christmas gift and she was very pleased with them. They were well made and should last a very long time. They look great on her, too. <end>  Cheap.  You get what you pay for. It is very cheap, simple, and weak. It is exactly like the picture. To each there own. <end>  Flimsy Product  This item is trash. I ordered these for my mother as a Christmas gift. They broke within a week of her wearing them. We replaced them with a new pair and the same thing happened. I will never buy a product like this again. <end>  Beautiful earrings  This is a pair of beautiful earrings. I think my mother will like it. But it is not made in USA as the description says. It is made in Dominican Republic. <end>  My Christmas present  My husband never buys me a present so when I saw these on your web site I had to have them. So I treated myself. They are really pretty and look just like the picture. <end>
 B0000B35EL  Duragold 14k Gold 6mm Ball Studs ||	  Nice earrings.  When my mom got this earrings, she was super happy. the size is perfect, not too big not to small. very lovely earrings to give as a present for any occasion, young or old. <end>  Duragold 14k Yellow gold 6mm stud earrings  Beautiful product...looks like 14k gold although it is a gold blended product. Has a very shiny surface and the posts are long and secure. <end>  14K gold ball earrings  These beautiful pierced earrings are just what I wanted. They are exactly as described and even have a slightly larger back which makes them easier to put on and holds the earrings more securely than the usual tiny backs. <end>  Nice but short stud  Nice earrings but they have a short stud. It barely goes thru my earlobe and attaches in the back. If you have thick earlobes, you better reconsider. <end>  These get so many great comments  I was sceptical about the low price, but when the earrings arrived promptly, and I, as a man, use only one, I was reassured by the post and butterfly clamp. VERY WELL MADE. Perfect size; the gold has an incredible sheen only found in 14K gold. I especially recommend the 6mm size for a man. One of the best buys I have made from Amazon. <end>  earrings  Very happy with the earrings. Price was great and I love getting shipping free. <end>  Earrings  I purchased these Duragold 14k Yellow Gold stud earrings for my daughter. They are exquisite, just as described and illustrated. I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  it's okay  picture makes the stud appear to have a diamond shape, but it's just a round ball earring. It's just okay. <end>  flimsy  The posts were flimsy and the backs were very small. I purchased a pair from another vendor after returning these to Amazon. I received those today. The posts are more substantial and backs are larger and easier to handle. Cost was approximately $10 less. <end>  Mine arrived with dent in one earring  One earring looked beautiful, the other had a dent in the side. Amazon gave me free shipping back and a new pair is on the way. We'll see how the new ones look.Follow up  The new earrings arrived and they are beautiful. My daughter loves them. These are very nice earrings. I upped my review to 4 stars. <end>  Great Size!  These earings are beautiful. They are a really good size for your ears. Not too big , and not too small.I did not give them 5 stars because the back of the earings are loose. You have to be really careful when wearing them. I would have given them 5 stars if the back of the earings were tight-----making them less likely to loose. <end>  earrings  this is a christmas gift for my daughter. thank you for the great item for the wonderful christmas item for her <end>  Mechanical fault  I gave these earrings as a gift and they were very well received. My owl very much likes the smooth, shiny appearance.Problem  the tiny metal piece that holds the earring onto the ear is too loose. I refer to the bit of metal that looks (approximately) like the number "8."I would return the earrings, but my owl is already attached to them. Probably because they resemble owl eggs.At this price I don't expect diamonds and rubies, but I do expect the earring to stay securely on the ear. It is only a matter of time before one of the "8" shaped pieces of metal falls off, and then an earring will be lost. <end>  Practical; good for everyday  I like these earrings for their clean simplicity. They're a good everyday size, not flashy or heavy. The backs, however, are too loose. I constantly have to push the backs up the post throughout the day, which is an annoyance. I just know these earrings will fall out one day. Pretty, but the poor quality of unmatched post size and backing take away from a high-star rating. <end>  Love these!  These earrings are slightly larger than "the perfect size" but not by much. These are my daily earrings, and so far I have no complaints at all. Lovely weight, not too thin. Highly recommended. <end>  quality is slipping  for $10 these were too good to pass up. First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece. First time I wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.This is the second pair I bought... first set was fine. Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping (or a different supplier?) <end>  Great and inexpensive  I got these on sale through Amazon, but even if I were paying Amazon's full price, I would be very happy with the purchase. A great deal for 14kt! The earrings are just what I wanted, and are quality-made. That in itself would be nice, but they come in a velvet box that is nestled inside a nice black slip-top box. The presentation is so great that now I'm thinking of buying my mom some jewelry from Amazon. <end>  Not the Same...  I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm & 6mm sizes. I was happy with all, but not with this 6mm size. These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner. While they look good, the posts are too short and very slippery, also the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily. I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost). Otherwise, they would have been fine. I returned them and would not buy this pair again. <end>  disapointing !  I was so happy with these earings until I wore them. The backs provided did not lock. I tried them on once, and the backs simply fell off. i managed to save both earings, and tried to find some ohter backings that would hold the earings in. Unfortuantely, this did not work, and the second time I wore them , I lost an earing. Perhaps the posts themselves were somehow wrong? I don't know. <end>  All they should be  This pair of gold studs is light, but well made and exactly what I was looking for. My husband gave them to me early so I could wear them before Christmas. They are comfortable, just the right size, and very well made. I highly recommend them. They are NOT cheap in any way. <end>  BEAUTIFUL BUT BE CAREFUL...  just a word to the wise  when separating the tag from the earring clasp/back, be sure to use scissors or anything small to cut the tag off. DO NOT PULL THE TAG OFF. the gold bends easily causing the clasp to loosen and fall off the earring post. other than that, the earrings are the perfect size for the average adult female ear. <end>  Awesome Gold Ball Post Earrings  These earrings are great! I had some many many years ago, andcouldn't wait to get these. Highly recommend them! <end>  Very Nice...  I have read a few complaints about these earrings, but I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they were of very good quality. They arrived very well packaged and came with a nice navy blue velvet box. Along with another box to match it to put that in. <end>  Simplicity at it's Best  These ball earrings are great for my second set of ear piercings. They are just the right side and they are not obnoxious to wear to the office. <end>  cuuuuuuuuuuute  those earrings are sooooooo cute, when i first saw them i thought they were really tiny, but when i put them on they were just perfect ^_^, not too big not too small...i recommend it to everyone <end>
 B0000B35FY  14k Yellow and White Gold "X" Earrings ||	  Broken  These earrings looked great and I really liked them but in less than a month, the posts broke completely off and the earrings are now completely useless. <end>  Not quite what I expected.  I chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo. They felt quite flimsy when I got them. I do like a lightweight earring, but not a flimsy one. The studs on these are not attached as firmly as I would like. One has already come off. They are however very pretty. The quality was just not what I expected. <end>  Garbage!!!  I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser. When I contacted Amazon, they said that because it was over 2 months that I had bought the earrings I couldn't return them. What a rip off. These earrings don't even deserve 1 star. <end>  Beautiful  This was a gift and was lovely and beautiful. Not too big, not to small. Delivery time was great. Strongly advice to buy this. <end>  Wouldn't buy again  (  When I opened the package and inspected the posts, I noticed that one post was already falling off. They are very cute earrings but not made of high quality. I guess you get what you pay for. <end>  Cute earrings  Very happy with these earrings. I enjoy two tone gold jewelry and was happy with the quality of these earrings once they did arrive. You won't be disappointed with this purchase. <end>
 B0000B35GD  Duragold 14k White Gold Hoop Earrings, (1.18" Diameter) ||	  LOVE'EM  Just received my earrings and they are beautiful!! So worth the money!! I did my research and this was by-far the BEST quality and price!! Highly recommend these earrings! <end>  classic style  These earrings are a good size but still very light. It is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them, but once hooked they stay safely closed all day. The clasp sytem does not show once the earrings are on - so this is a very clean and classic look. I have long hair and the clasp does not tangle in my hair. <end>  Positive  I loved the earrings, but unfortunatly one of them was faulty and had to send it back. The package was lost in the transition but Amazon gave me a full refund and was very helpful. The earrings were beautiful and of good quality. <end>  Just What I Wanted  These earrings are super cute and were exactly what I was looking for. They're light and comfy and I hardly even notice I'm wearing them. The 2mm diameter (just over 1/16" ) isn't too bulky or flimsy and the overall size (just over 1 1/4" at it's widest point) is perfect and not gaudy. The clasp is easy to open and close when you need it but stays securely fastened during wear. I would definitely recommend these. For the price, these really can't be beat. <end>  My new "permanent" earrings  These are VERY comfortable earrings. I even sleep in them. The hoops go with everything and I very seldom wear other earrings now. <end>  Great for the price!  A quality earring, good size and very bright. The are also very secure. <end>  White gold hoop earrings  The wire on one of the earrings broke the second time that I wore them. I can put it back on, but it repeatedly breaks. If it comes off while I am wearing the earrings, I will lose the whole earring. The pair cost $59, and I expected better quality. <end>  excellent value  STILL PERFECT IN 2009!!!!These earrings are beautiful and sturdy but a bit smaller than I expected. they are still a good deal and have good weight and good clasps. I looked at department stores and did not find anything like these or of this quality at either store. I also looked on other websites and would have had to pay more for similar earrings.I WISH I HAD GIVEN THEM A 5 STAR RATING!!! <end>  Didn't even last a year  I really loved these earrings when I first got them. I wore them probably at least three times a week for the last year.Pros * Not overly expensive* Nice size* Pretty (initially)Cons * Clasp comes undone very easily, have almost lost them many times* Pretty thin, could easily bend or dent* Only lasted a year before the gold plating started to wear offThe earrings still don't look too bad from the front, but in the back, where they rub against my skin, the gold plating has worn away exposing the base metal underneath. I expected better for the price... I've only had them a little over a year.I am extremely dissappointed in the quality of these earrings. I have a smaller pair of white gold hoops that I alternate with these that I've had for well over 10 years, and have had no problems with them. <end>  Nice finsh and good price  I got this as agift in she likesd it very much. <end>  lost one after only a month  These are beautiful and the perfect size for me. I wore them for a month and then lost one. I would imagine that is a reflection of the earring because I was just walking around. If I had worn it during sports or something rough I would expect that to happen but not when I am just sightseeing. I am severely disappointed since they are a bit pricey and I wanted them to last for a long time and thus made the investment into white gold. <end>  EXPENSIVE FOR THE PRODUCT (COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING)  THESE EARRINGS ARE NOT "BAD LOOKING", JUST A BIT FLIMSY FOR THE PRICE. AND WHAT SHOULD THE PRICE BE AND/OR WHAT IS REASONABLE FOR EARRINGS SUCH AS THESE? ANYWHERE FROM $20.00 TO $105.00 (THAT IS WHAT I PAID!) I BELIEVE THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH FOR A PAIR OF THIN HOOP EARRINGS. SOMEONE WILL BRING UP THE OUTRAGROUS PRICE OF GOLD AND THESE ONLY WEIGH 2.5 GRAMS. 18 GRAMS IN AN OUNCE OF GOLD AND THERE YOU ARE.I AM NOT SURE IF I AM GOING TO KEEP THESE OR NOT. I HAVE MANY METAL ALLERGIES AND SENSITIVITIES AND HAVE FEW SELECTONS FOR HOOPS (WHITE). IN FACT, I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A PAIR OF 14K WHITE GOLD HOOPS FOR OVER 5 YEARS. YES, I AM SELECTIVE AND FOR THE PRICE I BETTER BE!JANICE <end>  Very disappointing.  Earrings were very lightweight, hollow, and the hoops were very thin. Not good quality, I could have done better at WalMart. I expected a lot better from Amazon.com, especially for $50. <end>  So far so good )  Love these hoops so far. I had other pairs(not this brand) that have just broken and fallen off...so I am happy with these. They are 14k gold(the only type of earrings that don't cause my ears to break out), but they are also affordable. Nicely made and very comfortable. <end>  great basic earring. Casual to professional...  I can't wear sterling silver. It tarnishes on me. Plus I just like the real thing.  )They're a must have. I needed white gold, and these are the right size to take you from casual to professional and put together. Looks good. <end>  Rico's View  Bought this for my lady and scored big points! Very elegant looking and well made! I love the look of the white gold. <end>  love em!  My sensitive ears are a litmus test for genuine 14K gold and these passed the test. They seem sturdy and well made. I get compliments all they time. They're a good in-between size so they work for casual, office, or dress-up. I take them on and off daily and have had no trouble with the wire bending or breaking. I expect they can stand up to ordinary wear and tear. They arrived well packaged in an attractive velvet pouch. <end>  Right size for the right price  I was looking for a pair of hoops for my daughter and these were the size she wanted. Loved them so I bought myself a pair. Infact she lost her's and bought another pair. So in all we have bought 3 pair altogether. Right size and right price. <end>  Good  The earings were as pictured and what I expected. They are nice and light in my ears. <end>  Good value for money  I am very pleased with these. They are quite solid and a nice size. Not huge but not too small. <end>  Extremely High Quality Earrings  These are very nice earrings with a high quality finish. They are just the right size and not too heavy. I would highly recommend this product! <end>  so far so good  just got these in and slipped them on. they are very light, the don't even feel like i have any earrings on. the size is great, they measure just over an inch in diameter. recommended. <end>  Pretty.  These earrings are quite a bit larger than I expected but doable. The snap-lock closure holds them securely and their weight is very comfortable.My hair is long (mid back) and since I wear it loose, the earrings tend to "get lost". They would be spectacular with shorter hair or an updo. <end>
 B0000BUWEI  14k Yellow Gold Rope Chain Necklace, 20" ||	  Was very pleased..  I bought this gold chain for my husband for his birthday. It came in a nice gift box and is really beautiful, even better than the picture of it. He wears a couple of things on the chain, a medical alert and one other and the chain handles them both very well. The length was perfect too. So, I was pleased that he was happy with it. <end>
 B0000BUWIZ  14k White Gold Oval Miraculous Medal ||	  not quite what I had expected  The medal looks nice, but unfortuantely it appears that it is hollow....it defintiely has a funny sound because of it!I wish I had known that before I ordered it. <end>
 B0000BUWJZ  14k Yellow Gold Round St. Michael Medal ||	  Pendent is hollow  I just bought this item as a gift. When I received it I found it to be very light weight. When tapped the face has a hollow sound. It is very nice looking but I am worried that under everyday conditions the pendant may dent and collapse. Especially since I did get this item to be worn under a bullet proof vest of an active officer. I'll write back to let you know if it holds up.Edit  It has been nearly a year and it still is holding up well. <end>
 B0000BUWOV  14k White Gold Diamond-cut Glitter Mesh Hoop Earrings ||	  Great bargain!  These earings are the perfect size for a business casual or formal outfit. They are elegant, simple and extremely versatile. If you're looking for a large, flaunty hoop, these are not for you. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! <end>
 B0000BUWQC  14k Gold Two-tone Baby Shoe Charm ||	  Adorable Charm!!!  I received the baby shoe charm, nicely packaged, as promised. It is soooo cute! I receive lots of compliments on it. It looks like alot of the other expensive ones you see out there....and not cheesy like the cheaper ones. It has lots of detail to it...very realistic and very cute! <end>
 B0000BUWQZ  14k Yellow Gold Satin Finish Enamel Little Girl Charm ||	  emphasis on LITTLE  Maybe I missed it, but nowhere in the description did I find the size of this charm. It's a very nice quality, nicely enamaled and I really liked the design. However, I was very disappointed in its size. If you're in need of a tiny charm this will be ideal. <end>  Little Girl's dress falls off  While I was specifically looking for this exact charm and was delighted to find it, I am less than thrilled with how long it has lasted. The pink little girls dress fell off of the gold girl charm in less than two weeks. While the charm still looks presentable and no one can tell unless they look really closely, it was a disappointment. <end>
 B0000BUWS0  14k Yellow Gold Sandal with Rose Heart Charm ||	  VERY CUTE!!  I purchased this as a gift & it was well received. Very cute on a 20" box chain. The detailed work on both the sandal & the rose heart charm was very nice. Very well made. I'm only sorry I didn't pick up a couple more as they are currently not available anymore. <end>  Description  It is significant and relevant to a purchaser to know the exact size of the charm to be purchased. I would add this charm to a bracelet with other charms. This infomation is not provided so I was not able to decide whether to purchase it or not. <end>
 B0000BUWT3  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-Cut Reversible Snowflake Charm ||	  Snowflake Charm too small  I'm giving this snowflake charm a low rating because of the size. If it would be larger, it would be gorgeous. Photos on the internet can be deceiving. This snowflake charm is a little smaller than a dime. <end>
 B0000BUWT7  14k Yellow and Rose Gold Diamond-Cut Love Charm ||	  Dije  Este es un dije muy bonito. Especial para personas de edad intermedia o para ese amor que siempre nos tiene pendiente. Muy agradable. <end>
 B0000BUWU8  14k Yellow and Rose Gold Grandma Heart Charm ||	  Perfect for birthday or Mother's Day gift  I saw the exact charm at Kay Jeweler's at the local mall for a lot more money. I liked it a lot, but it was too expensive. Glad I checked with Amazon.com. Great buy! <end>  Great GIft for First-Time Grandmother!  My friend has not taken this off since I gave it to her. It really looks lovely on a 14 kt. gold chain. Great gift! Great price!! <end>  Very pretty, well worth the bargain price.  I bought this recently for my Godmother as a birthday gift from my daughter who considers her Grandma, and she just loved it! Said it was nicely sized, well made, especially liked the filigree work, said it was nice and sharp. I thought it was a great price for a pretty well made charm. <end>
 B0000BUX40  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-cut Filigree Shell Charm ||	  Very pretty charm  I was looking for a gold charm that wasn't too expensive. This Filigree Shell Charm was perfect. It is very pretty and reasonably priced. <end>
 B0000BUX4T  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-Cut "Sweet 15" Heart Charm ||	  Pic does no justice...much prettier in person  I bought this for my little sister's 15th and I felt ok buying it after looking at the picture, but I'm thrilled that I got it. The gold sparkles alot and this pendant looks like I paid at least twice as much! If you buy this pendant you would not be dissappointed...I wasn't! <end>
 B0000BUX9B  14k Yellow Gold Enamel Pink Butterfly Charm ||	  it is a nice piece but too small  The pink butterfly is very cute but way too small. It measures less than 1/2 inch. It is nice piece for a bracelet charm or for a girl. <end>  Beautiful!!!  This is very nice for the price! I was very happy with mine when I got it! <end>
 B0000BUXA7  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-cut Christ Head Charm ||	  Solo cristo  Solo es el rostro de cristo pero tiene un excelente acabado. Deslumbra a quien lo mire. <end>
 B0000BUXAE  14k Yellow Gold Diamond-cut Sand Dollar Charm ||	  Beautiful Jewlery  This piece was even more beautiful than i had anticipated. It's exactly what i've been looking for. I even ordered one for my good friend. The ordering process and shipping was all highly professional, and incredibly timely, recieving the item sooner than expected. all is wonderful. <end>
 B0000BVETV  14k Yellow Gold Princess Cut Diamond Solitaire Earrings (1/3ctw, I-J, I1) ||	  Exactly as advertised  The diamonds look good - very colorless - and their golden housing is well-constructed, looking good and keeping the diamonds secure but well-shown. Exactly as advertised. <end>
 B0000BVEXP  18k Yellow Gold Princess Cut Diamond Stud Earrings (1ctw, H-I, SI2) ||	  Fantastic quality diamond solitare earrings  I wanted to purchase my wife of 30 years a fine pair of diamond stud earrings for her recent birthday. I've bought a lot of jewelry over the years and I know what she likes and what she doesn't like. So my work is always cut out for me to make the grade.The first place I stopped was Amazon.com. I knew roughly what size, color and clarity I wanted, and I knew they had to be 18kt gold settings with a screw back. My wife does not like the cheap 14kt gold settings one typically finds on mass produced jewelry. After finding these 1 ct total weight solitares, with 18kt screw backs with Certification, I drove over to the mall and did a bit of comparision shopping. Well, it was NO COMPARISON!! First, none of the stores offered anything other than flimsy 14kt gold mounts with press on backs. Not good enough when they are carrying 1/2 carat diamonds! And the color and clarity offered were several grades lower than what Amazon was offering for a similar price.I ordered them and two days later they arrived safely at my doorstep. The mounts are very well done with well polished surfaces, with fine screw backs. The diamonds really sparkled and the certificate included spelled out exactly what I was getting.I gave them to my wife and she was thrilled with them. She has had them on for six weeks and she says they are so comfortable that she can sleep in them, which she usually can't do with most of her pierced earrings.I rate these earrings on a value to price basis as a solid 5 stars. Do your comparison shopping....you won't find earrings like this in your search. They are a stellar value. <end>  Beautiful Diamond Earrings at an Excellent Price  I ordered these earrings for my wife as a wedding present. After doing comparison shopping against some of the online competition, I discovered that Amazon's price was inline with the competition. My final decision to buy with amazon.com was due mainly because I've trusted them with so many purchases in the past. This was one of the largest online purchases I have ever made, so trust was very important to me. When I received the earrings, the quality was much better than quoted on the website. My wife absolutely loved the earrings! I would definitely buy jewelry from amazon.com again!! <end>  Dazzling Diamonds  The diamond stud earrings are exactly what I hoped they would be when I ordered them. Extremely pleased! <end>
 B0000BVEY6  18k White Gold Princess Cut Diamond Stud Earrings (1/3ctw, H-I, SI2) ||	  Beautiful!  I received my earings today and i'm impressed. The appraisal certificate is valued at more than what i payed for. The earings look magnificant! They look bigger in my ears than what i had imagined. I will be buying the matching pendant next! <end>  Beautiful earrings, and I got them free!  These earrings are absolutely gorgeous, and I got them free in a special promotion at this web site  getbestfreestuff.com/jewelry <end>
 B0000BVF1T  IGI Certified Platinum Princess-Cut 4-Prong Diamond Stud Earrings (3/4 cttw, G-H Color, VS2 Clarity) ||	  Amazing Quality from Amazon  I ordered these for my wife, two days before our second child was to be born as I wanted to have something special to give her in the hospital. In the days leading up to the birth, however, I just didn't have the time to get out to a jewelry store. I took the chance and ordered these. Short of it is that they are absolutely wonderful. Better than advertised. They have a beautiful color and brilliance that are really the sign of fine diamond jewelry. My wife thinks the (substantial) sparkle lights up the room.I was on a tight time frame so I ordered them next day air. Because I ordered before noon, I had them--literally--the next day. They came beautifully presented in a polished wooden box. Extremely classy and befitting fine jewelry. <end>  Beautiful Earrings  These are beautiful earrings. Exceptional quality for a fair price. These are a nice size without being too large on the ear, and the sparkle is definitly noticable. Customer service and delivery time was great too. I would definitly consider buying jewelry from Amazon again. <end>  Beautiful diamonds and a great buy  I shopped around for earings quite a bit and must admit I was initially a bit hesitant to buy fine diamonds from Amazon. That changed when they arrived. The diamonds are spectacular and better quality than the minimum listed. The packaging is elegant, including a nice wooden box and nicely packaged certificate to accompany the diamonds. Another winning product from Amazon. <end>  Nice, but not a match  I ordered these diamonds for myself as a 50th wedding anniversary present. They were shipped and then delivered the very next day. Good service, so far. Upon examining the diamonds under a strong magnifying glass I discovered  They were a good color, and very clear, as stated. They are described as having a "good" cut. Not "very good". This is very important, apparently. In my case, "good" meant one diamond had a very nice cut, similar to what you see in drawings of a princess cut. The other diamond was not similar to the first one. The first one had a square, flat, table. The second one had a large rectangular, flat, table. I think they should be matched better. I wore them to my local jewelry shop and asked the jeweler what he thought. With just a casual glance at them on my ears, he said "they don't match very well". However, he also said he didn't think anyone would notice this as they are worn far apart from each other. Otherwise, he said they were still a good value, considering their color, clarity, carat weight, and platinum setting. So, basically, you get what someone else picks out for you. Customer Service at Amazon was very courteous and wrote up my concerns and sent them to their Jewelry Dept. Several Times. I waited for a reply, and waited, and finally got a reply explaining how to return them (if I wanted) and referred to the fact that if I received them from a "different FC" it would be a different address. What is a FC? Another call, and found out FC meant Fulfillment Center. ??? Anyways, good value or not, if I were to do this again, knowing what I know now, I would shop at a live shop with people and the jewelry right in front of me, to eliminate the hassle. By the way, by the time I finally got the correct address and procedure for returning them, I had become "attached" to the darn things thinking to myself "well, every diamond has it's own personality, no two are alike, etc." So call me crazy, I have grown fond of them now and just can't bring myself to return them. Still, buyer beware. <end>  Better than I would have imagined!  I was incredibly skeptical about buying diamond earrings online-even though it *is* Amazon. But, with a generous return policy (30 days), I thought I had nothing to loose. Boy oh boy, these earrings are more beautiful than any pair I ever looked at in the offline world! I couldn't be happier!And, the price?!?!? For the cut, clarity, color, and platinum setting, the price can't be beat! <end>  They are BEAUTIFUL!  I have been looking for a set like this for forever! They are just stunning, after I bought my first 1/4 cttw, I had to have another set. These are just perfect not too big, & definitely not too small I can workout in them & I'm not in fear that they will fall out or be damaged. Well worth the money in my opinion. <end>
 B0000BVF1V  IGI Certified Platinum Princess-Cut 4-Prong Diamond Stud Earrings (1 cttw, G-H Color, VS2 Clarity) ||	  Nice, but ...  I was pleased with the earrings ... those I received were slightly over 1cttw, F & H color, and VS2. Nice, but not an excellent match for a pair.So, I did have some questions about the order & what I received. I contacted CS, only to be referred to the jewelry department, and I waited ... and waited ... for a response. Then, I received some snarly comments that did not even address my questions & concerns.This was not my first purchase from Amazon jewelry, but it was my last. I am back to working with local B&M; jewelers with live, thoughtful human beings. And price-wise, I'm probably doing better ... it was just the convenience & selection online that was so impressive. I'm simply tired of not getting answers to legitimate questions ... and I don't need to put up with being treated like crap when I'm making 4-figure purchases.Adios, Amazon jewelry department! <end>  Great for a gift  I ordered these for my wife and they turned out great. She was very happy with them.We ended up getting 0.52 CT each, with G & H color, and VS1/VS2 clatirity.Great earrings but the price fluctuates alot on amazon for this item. <end>  Awesome for the price!!!  I bought these earrings when they were an extra 75% off ($550) and I can say these are amazing. The pair I received were VVS2/VS1 and G/H color and had a appraised value of almost $6000.Thanks Amazon. <end>  wife love diamond  The diamond look very good and it was even better quality that they said on the site. It came as G, Vs2. My wife love this diamond that i got to play halo 4, black ops and Crysis 3 for two month with out her saying a word.Thank you Amazon! <end>  My girlfriend loves these!  Ok first off, what woman doesn't want diamond earings? THEY ALL DO. Diamonds are the way to any womans heart. I bought these for my girlfriend and she LOVES them. They princess cut is gorgeous, the clarity of the diamond in unmatchable, its all together 1 carat which is the perfect size for earings and they are very sparkly in and out of light. I found an even better pair that I can't wait to give to her. Instead of 1 carat they are 1.5, briliantly cut and round. They are beautiful and the perfect christmas gift too!!!http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IK21CM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B000IK21CM&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazon070f-20 <end>  Wife was surprised and very happy!  I bought these for my wife as a Christmas/birth of second child present. I was very pleased with the quality and price of the earrings. I wasn't going to bite initially because these were about $500 more than I wanted to spend but when they dropped just below $2K (my target) and according to the amazon price tracker website it was the lowest price ever, then it became a no brainer. The problem I had was I slept on it a night and the price went back up....I used Amazon's "tell us about a lower price" to another website that was having a sale and low and behold they dropped it back down to match that price. Way to go Amazon!!! The IGI certificate/appraisal said that they were .5 & .5 each color G-H, clarity VS1-VS2 and had an appraisal of $5,250. She had been wanting some of these earrings forever and 1ctw is the perfect size. She loves the screwbacks to keep them in place. We normally only spend a couple of hundred each on one another for Christmas so I broke the bank on this one, but the look on her face when she was expecting some other piece of jewelry inside the little box was priceless!!! Yes it was nerve racking buying sight unseen but since I was dealing with Amazon I knew that if these did not meeting my expectations then I would be able to return them and that gave me piece of mind to take the plunge. <end>  amazing diamond earings!  Do not hesitate to buy these earings! The ones I received were G color VVS2 clarity. Everyone notices these. I had my daughter wear these for a wedding (age 10) but looked too large for her ears. For me, they are just right for everyday wear. Very sparkly. I am so happy with these! <end>
 B0000BVF5A  18k White Gold Princess Cut Diamond Solitaire Pendant (1/4ct , H-I, SI2) ||	  NO CERTIFICATE  Although the product specifications state that the diamond is IGI certified, a certification does not come with the pendant! Very nice otherwise. Would have 4 stars if it had the certification. I will have it appraised to ensure the quality stated in the specifications is factual before the 30 day return period...just in case. <end>
 B0000BVGMN  14k Yellow Gold Round Brilliant Diamond Bracelet w/ Bar Design (3ctw, I, I1) ||	  Great quality, but only 1 length offered  This is a great buy, and the quality for the price is exceptional. The only thing wrong with it is that if you need a 7.5&quot; or 8.0&quot; bracelet (not everyone wears petite sizes), you're out of luck. <end>
 B0000BXFNH  Sterling Silver, Diamond-Cut Blue Crystal, Black Crystal 1-Strand Bead Bracelet w/ Garnet Toggle Clasp, 7.5" ||	  great description of the bracelet!  bicone, cool blue waves, swirls--I love the description! It makes the bracelet sound like the perfect vacation! <end>
 B0000BXG2H  Sterling Silver Fancy Oval Engraveable Identification Cuff Bracelet ||	  Elegant  I purchased this for my sister in laws birthday and she loves it, It is such a simple and pretty piece <end>
 B0000BXG2P  Sterling Silver Floating Heart Pendant on 18" Sterling Silver Chain ||	  Great holiday gift  I bought two of these to give as Christmas gifts for my nieces. I am pleased with the quality of this item and the great price. The packaging is really nice and I'm planning to slip these under the tree without further wrapping. <end>  Cute necklace!  I recently got this as a gift for my (future) mother-in-law along with several other pieces of jewelry. Considering how inexpensive it was, I was expecting something of low quality - but I was pleasantly surprised to get a very attractive and high quality pendant! I am contemplating now buying one for myself! <end>  Nice from afar, far from nice.  Unacceptable quality of workmenship. Even for $20.Pros Nice blue box, unmarked.Frontal view of pendant is nice and shiny, just as pictured.Cons Easily noticible mold line with ugly blotches along the entire inside circumference of the pendant.Thin chain, not shiny, not glamorous.It resembles a $100 Tiffany's pendant chain but the blotchy mold line really junks this other wise decent pendant. I decided not to give this gift so it's just collecting dust now. I can't return it because it says you need a certificate of appraisal or something. <end>  Stunned!!!  I bought this for my girlfriend and she thought I had bought it at tiffany's! It is an amazing price for the beautiful piece. <end>  Absolutely pleased!  My boyfriend is a PHD student and therefore on a tight budget, but he really wanted to buy me something nice for valentine's day. So I picked out this necklace seeing that it was so inexpensive and it looked pretty cute. For the price, I was expecting some cheesy light-weight pendant, but to my surprise this item was MUCH more than I expected. It's a beautiful simple, yet sweet, necklace with nice packaging...no tangling whatsoever...came nicely out of the blue velvet drawstring bag. Great Gift. <end>  Poor quality Jewelry  I ordered this product about a month ago, it took forever to arrive, and when it did it was all tangled up into a little ball. The chain was very poor quality and when I tried to untangle it, it never really straightned out. Don't order this!!! <end>  Well done knock-off  This piece is a Tiffany &amp; Co. knock-off. The original costs well over $100, so if you are a lover of Tiffany yet can't find it in your budget, I'd say go with this piece! There are also others here at Amazon that are highly satisfactory. Just compare them with the Tiffany website! <end>  Sterling Silver  This item looks very nice, but when I got it in the mail, it was really tangled up and it appears to have a chip on one of the sides, not very noticable to return, just a small chip. It took about 10 minutes to untangle, but the necalace looks very nice, and is definatly something to buy for valentines day. <end>  Garbage!  The clasp was broken when I got it. The chain is so cheap that I could pull it to pieces with gentle tension. The heart is so cheaply made that you can see the glue that stuck the two halves together. <end>  Ssimple, cute and a great deal!  I have been &quot;eyeing&quot; the one Tiffany sells and decided to give this one a try...the price made it worth the risk. I think it is a great size heart pendent and glad that I didn't get the larger one they also sell on Amazon. The chain is a bit thin, but the emphasis is on the heart pendant-NOT the chain. It is definitly worth the $20. <end>  Great Buy!!!  This necklace is just so beautiful. The quality for this price is amazing. I wanted it the moment I saw it because it looks so graceful and classic. I wasn't disappointed at all when I got the pendant. When it came, the necklace itself was a bit tangled so it took a while to untangle it, but that didn't leave any damage on the product. The heart is genuine sterling silver and you can feel the weight of it, making you realize the high quality of this pendant. The chain itself is nice and light,and feels good when you wear it. I would definitely recommend bying this pendant, for yourself and anyone you love!! <end>  Very Happily Surprised!  I read all the reviews before I decided to purchase this necklace for myself. Most were good, so for the price I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say, I am very happy with this purchase! The heart is very substancial and shiny, and it sits very nicely on the lightweight chain. You could never guess that the necklace is so inexpensive! I would reccommend this to everyone! <end>  its funny  i got this for a valentines day present and within 20 min of wearing it, the clasp broke and is unrepairable. LOL it was more funny than anything else. it does somewhat feel cheap because you can see the melding on the inside of the pendant. i got another bracelet that was cheap and from amazon and it broke later that day when i tried to take it off. so i received two pieces of cheap sterling silver jewelery from amazon that broke in the same day. in this case i would say you get what you pay for. they have the exact same design at tiffanys, if you want one guaranteed to not break on you. <end>  wonderful  This is a beautiful lightweight necklace perfect to wear with any type of clothing. Indexpensive for its look and great. Only problem is that similar ones have been released by other companies too and it appears often loosing its' speciality in appeal. Overal very beautiful though. <end>  It's the thought that counts...  People, it's the thought that counts. If I have a girlfriend that would dump me for giving her a cheap pendant then I probably wouldn't get together with her in the first place. I know that sounds clich&eacute; but that's true and it's often been over looked. You pay what you get, nobody said this pendant is going to be flawless, it only costs 20 dollars! I got this pendant to a girl whom I had a crush on for Christmas and she was thrilled, the packaging is delicate, and the pendent itself looked good, but that's not why she's thrilled, it's because I thought of her during that time of the season when there's more happiness in giving than in receiving. <end>
 B0000BXG2U  Sterling Silver Multi-Heart Necklace w/ 2" Extension, 16" ||	  Wonderful!  This is a beautiful choker of superb quality. It's perfectly polished and the hearts are slightly contoured to rest comfortably against your throat. The silver is extremely smooth and the craftsmanship is fantastic.The center heart is perfectly symmetrical and the four accompanying outlined hearts are identical without a loss in quality. All of the lines are sleek and flawless.I highly recommend this to anyone! <end>  Big hearts  I bought this necklace a year ago. Beautiful and very good quality. Besides the common hallmark on the clasps, each single heart has the sterling silver hallmark which is quite unusual and nice.Unfortunately it doesn't look good on me. I am 5'5.5", but quite slim. The hearts are quite big. The center one's length is about the quarter coin.Even so, it is such a beautiful beautiful piece of silver jewelry!!! <end>  I love this necklace  Good quality and workmanship. Hearts are larger than I expected, but it is still beautiful. <end>
 B0000BY87J  14k Two-Tone Diamond Hoop Earrings (1/4ctw, I, I1) ||	  Excellent Value for Money  I bought this for my wife on her birthday - and not being too educated in selecting great jewelry, I was a little skeptic when I ordered them online. But when my wife saw them, she really loved them ( and she is quite a connoisseur when it comes to diamond jewelry - are'nt all women?!!) And they really look awesome on her - what more could I ask for! <end>
 B0000BY87V  14k White Gold Round Dangling Diamond Pendant (1/2ctw, I, I1) ||	  Beautiful necklace, nice price  I bought this for my wife and she loved it. It is beautiful and of great quality. My only problem was that the ad claimed the necklace was 18", when in reality it was only 16", with a 1" drop, which did not help size wise around the neck. We spent $40 to have the chain lengthened (as this was cheaper than buying a whole new chain) and now she wears it every other day. The diamond is a decent size and it is a unique piece of jewelry. <end>
 B0000BY88I  18k Yellow Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1ctw, G-H, VS2) ||	  Extremely Happy  My girlfriend loves these and wears them all the time. I thought they were a bargain compared to the best price for similar diamonds in any local jewelry store I could find. <end>
 B0000BY88Q  Platinum Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1 1/2ctw, G-H, VS2) ||	  Blinging in the New Year.  Well folks,Your ol' pal Bitsy here to tell you about my latest adventure. I was eating a variety of popcorn meats while watching "Cribs" and I realized my bling factor was way, I mean, way low. I needed something that would Ice me up and down simultaneously. Being that times are tough I didn't treat myself to a new Bentley(I could've gotten a great deal on Jermain Dupri's freshly IRS seized). I wanted this year to be special, so I began my search. Now, understand there are more expensive rocks out there, but "The Bits" just don't get blinged to anything but the finest Platinum. When The earrings arrived they were stunning. The cut was nice so all the light in the room refracted up and joyed my eyes. Even in medium light they looked great in my ears, eyebrow or nostril. Don't worry, the posts are threaded to hold up that Bedrock. In Closing, if you are considering an intra-personal gift sure to please, bet Blingy with the 1.5Ct yummy num nums, <end>
 B0000BY88U  18k Yellow Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Solitaire Pendant (1/2ct , H-I, SI2) ||	  Great better than described.  The diamond was larger and a better grade than described. Nice mounting and chain. Prompt shipment. <end>
 B0000BYA12  Sterling Silver Pretzel Heart w/ Double Strand Black Cord, 16" ||	  Check the necklace!  A very nice looking and good quality piece of silver jewelry. Better be sure to check the glue at the ends of the strand. Mine came loose after 2 hours on one end. The black cord ends are glued into silver caps and one was loose. Other than this minor defect, it is perfect! <end>  Sterling silver heart  I was not completely sure about buying jewlery over the Internet. For this type of gift I like to see and handle the item to decide. I was pressed for time and I did like the pictures of the item so I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did as I was very impressed by the quality and appearance when the item arrived. The price was low compared to the quality and my wife and I were very pleased with this jewlery item. <end>  Even nicer looking than the picture  The heart pendant is wonderful - a very nice size, good polished finish, well made and looks great. However, after about two weeks, one end of the silk rope necklace pulled out of the clasp.Amazon stood behind the product and promptly sent a replacement. Hopefully this rope will last longer. <end>  Awesome Pendant, short chain  Little bit nevious to buy a pendant off the net but this one is spot on, only problem is the necklace / chain it comes with was very short so I needed to purchase a 19" chain. Otherwise I would recomend this pendant.Also this was delevered to me in the UK very fast. <end>  Happy with purchase  I'm happy with this purchase. Have already worn it 3 times and have only had it for 1 week. I used another silver chain 1x to give it a little dressier look (with a dress), but other 2 times I used the black silk cord. It's a double cord and is a pretty good length -- just a tiny bit long for me, but that's because I typically like choker-length necklaces b/c they are a little more casual. This one is almost the perfect length though.This piece can be casual or dressy depending on your outfit (and if you have an extra silver chain for dressier occasions). The heart is substantial, a good size, and a little more alternative than the typical floating heart. I don't think I'd wear it for a really dressy occasion though, because it does tend more toward the casual side.It came in a nice dark blue fuzzy pouch which I'm going to use for carrying jewelry when I travel, and also came in a dark blue gift box for gift giving. I gave it 4 stars only because I think the price was just a tiny bit high -- considering there is only a silk cord included with it instead of a silver chain. I guess some people mentioned it is a really good price, but I am a bargain hunter! ;-) <end>  simple and pretty  I liked this necklace. The black cord and the silver heart look very clean and simple. Only wished that it was a couple inches longer. <end>  Nice gift for teenager or child  I purchased this for my 11 year old daughter and she loved it! I tried it on and thought it was a bit too snug around my neck (picture attached). I don't think it fits well on an adult neck but on young children it will be a definite hit. The cord is of nice quality and the heart is very polished looking. <end>  Very nice for a young lady  I bought the pretzel heart necklace for my 9 year old daughter and she loves it. This is a nice piece for the tween girl to look more adult and also a nice playful piece for an adult. The shine of the sterling silver is very nice. It's a nice size for a smaller framed person. The necklace I received has no problems with the cord, thus far. I even pulled on them before giving it to my daughter to wear and they did not come out. I like the fact that it's on a cord and not a chain as kids can sometimes be a bit rough with jewelry. I got this piece on sale and am very happy with my purchase for the price I paid. I would not pay the full price for the necklace as I don't think it is worth that much, but if you find it on sale here, go for it...I don't think you would be disappointed. <end>  pretzel heart  It was a great gift, it is nice that it is sterling silver and all. However the black cord slipped out of the clasps and thus the necklace is broken. So I have to buy another black cord for the necklace this frustrates me. <end>  Great Gift  This necklace is of nice quality for the price. I bought this as a gift for a 14 year old and a 36 year old and both were pleased. <end>  Pretty, but not perfect...  This necklace does look in reality as it appears on the screen, which is a good (and unfortunately not common enough) thing when ordering something online. My complaint is that it tends not to lie flat (maybe the pendant is too light? Or the cord is too flimsy?). The slightest movement of my body causes one side or the other to rise up. Maybe my body is too wavy. <end>  Girlfriend loved it!  Item is exactly as described. Comes in nice cloth gift bag inside gift box. Only thing is even though length is in description the cord is shorter than I realized (almost a choker), but my girlfriend was happy with it so I guess it's not a problem. <end>  Good one.  It is the one I want. Black cord with silver heart. Beautiful.The package box is little rough. <end>  Cord could have been longer  The silver heart is pretty, but the cord seems a bit too short. I hope that it is long enough. <end>  What do you really need to be told about this?  I gave this product a one for I can't understand why anyone would need a review about this. What you see is what you get. <end>

 B0000BYQYX  18k Yellow Gold 1ctw Round Brilliant Diamond Band (G, VS2), Size 6.5 ||	  Diamond Anniversary Band  This is a beautiful ring. The diamonds are of a higher quality than what you usually find in rings like this. The fire in these diamonds is unbelievable. Getting a ring like this for this price is great, getting this level of diamond quality for this price is incredible and the fact that they are certified is the icing on the cake. I shopped all over the net and could not find a 1ct. ring of this quality for any where near this price. I would recommend this ring to anyone that wants a top quality ring at a great price. <end>
 B0000C4CHW  14k White Gold Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 9.5 ||	  Pleasantly surprised!  After looking at dozens of other stores, I kept coming back to this ring for both the style and the price (after all, it is shipped free and would only take a few bucks to ship back if we didn't like it!) I do have to say that it did take a solid 3 weeks for this ring to arrive - longer than expected. But once it did, we were so happy with the purchase! It is a beautiful ring with a lot of weight to it - it feels very heavy in hand. It also has the slightly raised center portion that is just enough to give it an original look, but not too much that it looks too trendy. Another advantage over a brick and mortar store is that you can buy the ring in the exact size you need. A lot of regular stores only have what is in stock, and it has to be resized for you, possibly affecting the integrity of the ring. This is a very shiny classic that we are going to enjoy for years to come! Looks much better in person!!! <end>  A beautiful Ring!  After looking in various jewelry stores and searching the internet, my husband and I found this ring and it was exactly what he had in mind! We got married in May, and it still looks brand new! The size charts are accurate, and it fit him perfectly. A great deal for such a nice wedding band. <end>  Great purchase!  Like the other reviewers, I love this ring. It's heavy and durable, but it has nice detailing that isn't too flashy for my husband. He loves it, and jewelry stores would probably charge $500 or so for the same size ring. I am VERY satisfied with this purchase!! <end>  A nice ring  I love the design of this ring, and the fit was correct and comfortable. It scratches more easily than I had hoped, though I have to admit I'm not terribly easy on it. It polishes up nicely though. <end>  My ring  This is my wedding ring and I have had it for 2 years and it still looks great. <end>  Very Pleased  I purchased this ring in November 2007 as my husband's wedding band. It is beautiful. He is very pleased with the ring. He has never had a problem with the comfort, even though he has never worn jewelry before. Love it!! Great buy! <end>  Beautiful!!  I could not be happier with this ring.It is gorgeous, solid, nice weight (it doesn't feel cheap), and it really shines.They shipped it to me several days prior to the estimated delivery date.And I actually order a size too big (I think they run a little big), and Amazon was so courteous and efficient about returning the product and ordering a new one that fit, they really made it painless.I would recommend this ring to anyone looking for a quality wedding band who doesn't want to spend a fortune on an equal product. After this experience I will definitely be purchasing more jewelry through Amazon. <end>  Badly Scratched  The ring had a deep scratch in it. Returned it and purchased one from a store which warranties the product for life. Better choice I think. <end>

 B0000C4CJH  14k Yellow and White Gold Engraved 7mm Plain Wedding Band, Size 11.5 ||	  Attractive, well-designed men's wedding ring  Description  This two-tone, 14-karat men's gold wedding ring also sports two finishes. It consists of five zones or bands. The first, third, and fifth bands are shiny/polished and rounded (convex), with the outer bands in white gold, and the middle band in yellow gold. The second and fourth zones are flat and are raised slightly higher than the other bands, which should protect the shiny ones somewhat from damage. These two zones are white gold with a brushed finish and each are approximately 2.5 times the width of one of the shiny bands. The inside of the ring is white gold. The stamps read "14K" and "FA"*.Additional information  Amazon currently has two of this ring style listed (see http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000EVXWK/ref=cm_rv_thx_view/103-5051791-5395063?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=3367581), one slightly heavier than the other, with different sizes available in each. Unfortunately with both rings, the selection of sizes is limited.Opinion  I had been looking at this style of ring in a local jewelery store but then found this one on Amazon for less than half what the jeweler was asking. When the Amazon ring arrived, I was relieved to find that it was identical to the one I had been considering at the jewelry store.The photo of the ring here does not do it justice. It is a great-looking ring, and heavy enough to feel like gold should, but not so heavy as to be cumbersome. The inside is slightly convex, making the ring quite comfortable to wear.One issue to note  the ring I received appears to have a bit of light wear on the brushed surfaces  some minor nicks and scratches. Perhaps it had been returned by another customer and then shipped to me. I just received the ring tonight, however, so I will need to examine it more closely in the daylight to know whether to ask for an exchange. The bottom line  be sure to examine closely any jewelry you buy.Bottom line(s)  This is a very attractive and modern-looking ring that does not look like a pipe fitting, as do so many other men's rings today. I am very pleased to have found the ring on Amazon and am happy about the design and feel of the product. It will be a fine wedding ring.* Edit  The stamp actually reads "14(c)FG" - the FG = Frederick Goldman. The G looks like an A, though, which I believe must be part of Goldman's trademark. I've had the ring for two years now, and it's still beautiful. The texture on the raised part is smooth now, and more reflective (partly because I mistakenly asked a mall jeweler one day for a quick *polish* rather than a *cleaning*, and didn't catch my mistake before it was too late, and the guy had given it a light abrasive polish), but the ring is still beautiful. Definitely an excellent value; I'll continue to buy jewelry from Amazon. <end>

 B0000C4CKM  14k White Gold Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 10 ||	  EXCELLENT Ring!  This ring is by far the best value in the sub $500 price point. I ordered this ring recently and am quite pleased to say the least. The picture absolutely does the ring no justice -- as the craftmanship is outstanding.You cannot go wrong choosing this ring. <end>  Beautiful ring at ANY price!!!  My wife and I decided to update our wedding bands this year for our anniversary. I wanted something different than the plain 4mm comfort-fit yellow gold band I had since our wedding. I looked at many specialty web sites and jewelry stores, but my wife and I both fell in love with this ring. When we saw the price we thought it was too good too be true! We ordered it and received it the following afternoon (with a free shipping promo)! It is stunning! The only minor issue is the ring seems to run a little big (maybe 1/2 a size). Because of the pattern on the ring, it is not able to be resized, but Amazon would let you return it for a new size if necessary. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful  I am not one to write reviews, but my husband and I are so very happy with this ring, that I could not resist sharing this with you. The picture cannot display how amazing this ring is. And, it is definitely a bargain for the price! <end>  Quite Lovely  The packaging and the ring itself were quite lovely. Also, my fiance, who is "comfort oriented," was thrilled with the fit. <end>  Excellent quality! Excellent value  My fiance' and I have been looking for rings for some time now.

I bought this for my soon to be husband and he loves it! The center engraving makes this ring stand out among the same boring, shiny, flat wedding band. Just enough originality to make you take a second look! Comfort fit is also great!!! What a steal! <end>  Great price, quality  I was leery about an online jewelry purchase, but this is a great quality ring that is a steal for the price offered. Same ring is $600-$800 in most jewelry stores. Comfort fit also feels great! <end>  My husband loves this ring...  Unfortunately, my husband and I didn't pick out matching bands because he really likes his ring and I don't like mine. Nevertheless, as a previous reviewer said, this ring does run about a half a size bigger than it says so I would recommend that you keep this in mind when you purchase it because if you get it downsized (as my husband did) then the engraved matte inner band can't be salvaged. Even with the downsized ring it still looks nice....we've been married for over 3 years now and the ring looks like it is new (sans the matte center) both in color (white gold) and quality.

Beautiful ring. Excellent finishing. Comfortable. It does run almost a half size big. This is a serious bargain. <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring is absolutely beautiful! I bought this for my soon to be husband and he loves it! The center engraving makes this ring stand out among the same boring, shiny, flat wedding band. Just enough originality to make you take a second look! Comfort fit is also great!!! What a steal! <end>  Great price, quality  I was leery about an online jewelry purchase, but this is a great quality ring that is a steal for the price offered. Same ring is $600-$800 in most jewelry stores. Comfort fit also feels great! <end>  My husband loves this ring...  Unfortunately, my husband and I didn't pick out matching bands because he really likes his ring and I don't like mine. Nevertheless, as a previous reviewer said, this ring does run about a half a size bigger than it says so I would recommend that you keep this in mind when you purchase it because if you get it downsized (as my husband did) then the engraved matte inner band can't be salvaged. Even with the downsized ring it still looks nice....we've been married for over 3 years now and the ring looks like it is new (sans the matte center) both in color (white gold) and quality. We had planned to upgrade our bands but he loves his ring so I'll get the upgrade *yay*. <end>
 B0000C4CL2  14k White Gold Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 7.5 ||	  EXCELLENT Ring!  This ring is by far the best value in the sub $500 price point. I ordered this ring recently and am quite pleased to say the least. The picture absolutely does the ring no justice -- as the craftmanship is outstanding.You cannot go wrong choosing this ring. <end>  Beautiful ring at ANY price!!!  My wife and I decided to update our wedding bands this year for our anniversary. I wanted something different than the plain 4mm comfort-fit yellow gold band I had since our wedding. I looked at many specialty web sites and jewelry stores, but my wife and I both fell in love with this ring. When we saw the price we thought it was too good too be true! We ordered it and received it the following afternoon (with a free shipping promo)! It is stunning! The only minor issue is the ring seems to run a little big (maybe 1/2 a size). Because of the pattern on the ring, it is not able to be resized, but Amazon would let you return it for a new size if necessary. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful  I am not one to write reviews, but my husband and I are so very happy with this ring, that I could not resist sharing this with you. The picture cannot display how amazing this ring is. And, it is definitely a bargain for the price! <end>  Quite Lovely  The packaging and the ring itself were quite lovely. Also, my fiance, who is "comfort oriented," was thrilled with the fit. <end>  Excellent quality! Excellent value  My fiance' and I have been looking for rings for some time now.

 B0000C4CLF  Men's Titanium and 18k 6mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 10 ||	  Beautiful ring  When the ring came I was very impressed, it looks even better in person than in the picture.

 B0000C4KPI  18k Yellow Gold 7mm Comfort Fit Milgrain Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  Excellent!!!!!  I'm still in shock that I was able to get this ring for $[...]. At 7mm wide and 2.2mm thick, a size 9.5 weighs just about 10g. That is HEAVY and solid! It's beautifully made and I'm so thrilled to have found it. Hubby loves his new band, it's gorgeous in its simplicity but the best thing is the amazing price  I've priced rings like this at local shops for $600. Thank you, Amazon! <end>

 B0000C6BNN  Sterling Silver Cuff Links From The Marrakesh Collection By Zina ||	  Product barely looks like the picture  I purchased this as gift for a friend and was disappointed. In the web picture you see a clear contrast between the dark background and silver which is what attracted me to this item. The product that I received, however, had a barely filled 'gray' background instead of the rich black shown in the picture. Only when the shadows caught the item making it look dark, could you see some resemblance of what it's actually supposed to look like. So if this is any indication of the type of product quality this collection brings, stay away. <end>
 B0000C6BO2  Sterling Silver Earrings With Amethyst From The Metro Collection, By Zina ||	  Great gift  My wife loves the style but wishes the Amethyst was slightly larger and darker. <end>  Lovely earrings. Very gracefull.  I bought these for my wife, to match a similar necklace. These were a perfect match and were much less expensive. She wears these all the time and they are noticed quite a lot. <end>  Wonderful gift, lasts a long time  I bought these earrings for my girlfriend almost three years ago as a random present and they quickly grew to be among her favorites. Three years later, she still wears them several times a week and they still look brand new. I highly recommend this product for yourself or as a gift. <end>  amethyst earrings  i like these earrings just fine. i have the matching necklace as well. the stone is small so color is difficult to see, but a nice pair of earrings just the same. <end>
 B0000C6BOC  Sterling Silver Pillow Bracelet By Zina, 7" ||	  Great buy for $39.00  I Purchased this lovely bracelet at a sale price of $39.00. A good buy at at that price, but not worth the regular price of $90.00. This is a simple, but well made bracelet that looks great with all styles of clothing and can be mixed and matched with your other jewelry. <end>
 B0000C6BOK  Zina Sterling Silver Pendant With Blue Topaz From The Swirl Collection, 16" ||	  I like it very much!  I bought this necklace from a golden box deal. I loved the type of chain, it's sturdy enough. And the design of the pendant is very atypical, so surely it's an eye-catcher. The topaz has a very nice blue hue, it's small but not tiny. You can trust the photograph because that's exactly what you will receive! <end>

 B0000C884A  Sterling Silver Thin Granulated Ring by Lois Hill, Size 7 ||	  Lovely ring  I purchased this ring as a gift to myself and am delighted with it. I wanted something I could wear anytime and with anything. I have worn this to the office, on the weekends when dressed in jeans, and to a few dinners when dressed more for evening and it compliments everything. The ring is quite feminine and the design unique; however the weight of the ring gives it a durability that stands up to everyday activities. I have been more than pleased with my choice to purchase this ring and would recommend it to other women, or to those men looking for something special, yet not overpriced to give to the women in their lives. <end>

 B0000CC5SL  18k White Gold 4 Prong Diamond Tennis Bracelet (5ctw, H, SI2) ||	  Beautiful, and a great value  I bought this bracelet for my wife for Valentine's Day (I know, a bit excessive, but it was a special occasion.) I can't really add much beyond what's already in the description, except to say this  if you'd purchased this at Tiffany's, you'd have paid twice as much. The quality of the stones is excellent, the construction of the bracelet itself is great (there's no danger at all of its slipping off)... in short, it's a wonderful piece. My wife now wears it nearly every day! <end>

It fits just right, hangs perfectly, and looks great. <end>  it looks amazing and my boyfriend loves it BUT  he's only been wearing it for a week and the silver is beginning to tarnish. Perhaps a good cleaning will restore the shine but I'm disappointed that it needs it so soon after he began wearing it. <end>  Touching Gift  I received this from my boyfriend this past Friday. The meaning behind the "infinity" pendant got me emotional. The gift is perfect to tell someone that you love that person or for an anniversary. <end>
 B0000CEM9I  14k Yellow Gold Channel-set Round Brilliant Diamond Band (1/2ctw, I, I1), Size 5.5 ||	  Diamond fell out six weeks after I received it.  This was a gift for my wife on our 10th anniversary. The ring, itself, is beautiful, and we loved it. My wife is extra careful with her rings and has never had a problem with any of her settings. However, less than six weeks after we received this ring (I bought it on April 1, 2004), she happened to look at her finger and noticed that one of the small diamonds had fallen out (on May 17, 2004). She spent 10 panic-stricken minutes looking for it and found it on the carpet. She is so disappointed, and I feel embarrassed, as if I bought her a second-rate piece of jewelry. The ring is now in its box, and I am contacting Amazon to find out what coverage I have. Amazon has auto-emailed a response, indicating that I might return the ring for a refund only if I purchased it within the last 30 days. I bought it 46 days prior to the diamiond falling out. I emailed back inquiring about a repair and received an auto-response saying Amazon doesn't make repairs to jewelry. I now must call and demand help. Don't buy this ring. <end>
 B0000CEMB0  14k White Gold Channel-set Round Brilliant Diamond Band (1/4ctw, I, I1), Size 4.5 ||	  Beautiful ring alone or next to a solitaire  I just received this ring and was impressed. It's very pretty on, very dainty. I bought it to wear next to my solitaire engagement ring and it looks beautiful with it. The diamonds are small of course, but the ring itself is thin, so the diamonds stand out and it has great sparkle. When your hand is in a natural position, it looks like the diamonds go all the way around the ring. I shopped around and this is an amazing price for this ring, some cheap mall jewelers were charging $200+ for lower quality!! I would highly recommend it! <end>  Beautiful ring - pleasantly surprised!  I just received this ring for my wedding in August and I am very happy with it. It looks exactly like the picture except more sparkly in person. It is perfect next to my marquise solitaire. It is thin and feminine, which I was looking for. Many like this that I tried on in jewelry stores were either too wide or tall when compared to the band for my engagement ring. This is only slightly larger and looks perfect.How many jewelers offer returns within 30 days? Plus, it's free shipping! <end>  The Best Wedding Band for Solitare Diamond Rings  My husband bought me this ring for our wedding and it is absolutely spectacular!!! The same ring in a jewelry store cost around $295.00, therefore, we were a bit skeptical of buying it on Amazon.com. As soon as we saw it though, it was even more beautiful than the ones in the stores. It fits perfectly with my 1 carat solitare round diamond ring. Highly recommend!! <end>
 B0000CEMH2  14k White Gold Channel-set Princess Cut Diamond Band (1/2ctw, I, I1), Size 5 ||	  agutter  I shopped around at local businesses for the same ring. Most stores only sold an SI2, but they were about $800.00. This ring is worth the money, if you can not afford the higher quality. It does not look any different and is very pretty. I am using it as a wedding band next to my higher quality engagement ring and the diamonds look the same. I had it verbally appraised and the dealer said he would think it was worth about $500.00. <end>

 B0000CFZPN  Platinum Princess Cut Center with Round Side Stones Ring (3/8cttw, I, I1), Size 5.5 ||	  It is ok, but I am a bit dissapointed...  I am a bit disapointed in the ring and the service provided. The ring is very pretty, it came with a nice box, and apraisal information, but it does not look exactly like the picture shown on the site. On the picture shown, then the ring had a small curved line carved out on each side, around the 3 side stones, making it look more stylish, but on the one I recieved, the lines did not exist. Also, in the information package that was sent along with, then it said an identification number was inscribed in the inside of the band, so that the ring could be identified for insurance purposes, but again my ring did not have that number on it, it had all of the other specified inscriptions, but not that number. The producer also took forever to mail the ring. It was a good 3 weeks at least before they shipped it, after I placed my order. But when they finally sent it, it came overnight, so that was good. <end>
 B0000CG073  14k White Gold Princess Cut Center with Round Side Stones Ring (3/8cttw, G, VS2), Size 7.5 ||	  Definitely worth it!  I received this ring as a replacement for my wedding band and I have to say that it's absolutely gorgeous!The package included the IGI certificate and an appraisal form. I was happy to see that the ring is actually appraised at more than 2.5 times it's cost.The color, cut and total carat weight were better than the minimum requirements for this ring. Not sure if all rings will be better, but atleast the minimums are met and exceeded. <end>
 B0000CG07I  14k White Gold Princess Cut Center with Round Side Stones Ring (5/8cttw, H, SI2), Size 6 ||	  I said yes! =P  My fiance surprised me on my birthday with a marriage proposal, he asked me at night on the beach so I could not see the ring, but the diamonds sparkle so much I actually saw the sparkling in the moonlight! This ring is gorgeous, it shines and sparkles so nicely the photos on here don't do this ring real justice. This ring also came appraised at over double what it costs here, it's truely a great deal at this price. The center stone on mine actually is .5 ct not .45 ct like the description says here. The only downside to ordering from here, and why I rated 4 stars rather than 5 is that my fiance said the ring took a very long time to deliver (it was delayed beyond their original estimate). <end>  WOW  I must say that I am some what partial because it is my engagement ring, but it is gorgous! When my fiance got down on one knee, the tears started flowing, I was so suprised. Through the tears all I could see was sparkles, I knew it had to be beautiful! Although the description says that the clarity and color are atleast h, sI2, my ring was certified colorless, and apprasied at 3 times the price that he purchased it for! The quality of the ring is wonderful as well, the setting is thick and sturdy, not cheap and hollowed out like most rings you see at the jewlery counter! <end>

 B0000CNX14  14k White Gold Princess Cut Classic Solitaire Ring (1/3 ct, H, SI2), Size 5 ||	  Beautiful ring, and she said yes!  I'm probably not the first to tell you that I was skeptical buying a ring online. After looking at almost every jewelry store in town, I realized that most of the rings I looked at cost more, being at the same quality or less than what this ring stated. I bought, proposed, and married. She knows exactly where I got it and what it cost, which might be why she said yes. It was a smart decision. The ring looked beautiful, the diamond was brilliant, and it went well in a two ring piece. <end>

 B0000D8HGA  Zina Sterling Silver Square Ring With 14K Gold "The Swirl Collection", Size 5 ||	  Beautiful ring  I love this ring - however you have the description all wrong. It was obvious to me this ring had no diamonds even though the description says otherwise. I ordered and love the chunky look and I wear it with another sterling ring I have. It's gorgeous and I have received a ton of compliments. <end>  Not what it seems  I ordered this ring for my daughter for Christmas. The description of this ring is wrong. There is no diamond in this ring. I was very disapointed when I received this ring as it is very "chunky" and it does not seem to be sized correctly. I ordered a size 7 (my duaghters normal ring size) and it is way to large. She took it to several places to have it re-sized and no one will do it because of the metal it is made of. I would like to return the ring but it does not seem like I am able to. If you are interested in ordering this ring - be careful! <end>
 B0000D8HHA  Zina Sterling Silver Crossover Ring From The Swirl Collection, Size 7 ||	  Solid Ring Better Suited 4 Scarf Than Finger  Such a solid ring, but it's shape is actually square.

 B0000DAEZQ  Platinum Round Brilliant Cut Cathedral Solitaire Ring (1 ct, G, VS2), Size 5 ||	  Engagement Ring Nerves  It was nerve-wracking enough to get engaged and make a major purchase. But buying a ring online was new to me, and I hadn't met anyone who had done it. I was sweating bullets. The ring exceeded my expectations. It is dazzling in every aspect and boasts high quality craftsmanship. It even exceeded the specifications (the colorlessness was a grade better). Of the two independent international ratings that come with, one had a commercial replacement cost estimate that was about double what Amazon.com charged. I met my future wife online so it seemed appropriate, and I'm glad I took the risk. I endorse Amazon.com jewelry fully. <end>
 B0000DGK3K  Auburn Tigers "Seal" Men's Ring Size 12 - Sterling Silver Jewelry ||	  Great customer service  When I first received the ring it was obvious that it was the wrong design.

I couldn't be happier with the service I received and will always shop with global sports when buying sports jewelry. If you want top quality service along with great merchandise you can't go wrong with this company. <end>

 B0000DH53X  Miami Dolphins Pierced "Dolphins Logo" 3/8" Charm - Sterling Silver Jewelry ||	  Miami Dolphin pierced logo pendant  I was looking for ideas to purchase a gift for a Miami Dolphin fan. At this site I have found all that I have looked for, including some new ideas. The Miami Dolphins Pierced "Dolphins Logo" Pendant had a great picture to view as well as a description that was explained in detail.I plan to purchase this item for his birthday and know he will be suprised and excited to have a rare gift such as this. <end>

 B0000E1LZK  White Gold and Diamond Heart Link Bracelet ||	  Cheap, Misleading and Wasted money  First of all... let me say that i have already reviewed this item before and the review is missing. I bought this in 2005 as a valentine's day present for my wife. what we ended up getting was a very cheap looking bracelet in which one of the diamonds was missing. the clasp is very difficult to get on, and so far we have lost 3 diamonds from the chain. Please do not waste your money on this item.The photo does make it look brilliant. but there have been two separate and unrelated jewelry purchases that i have made through amazon, and all i can say is,... i will NEVER buy jewelry online AGAIN!i do think amazon has other great products... jewelry is not one of them. <end>
 B0000E1M2A  1/4 CT Two-tone Art Deco Diamond Engagement Ring ||	  great ring, not so great service  For the price, the diamond that comes in this setting, i felt was impressive. it has some fire to it, and it's raised in the setting [not shown from the angle that this picture is taken at -- making the ring MUCH taller than one would imagine], to catch light not only from the top, but from the bottom and sides as well.Again, this image is deceiving. The ring is a lot taller than shown here. Overall the rest of the ring is of good quality as well; the gold isn't cheap or flimsy. I liked it, but it was not what I was expecting.The, &quot;expidited shipping&quot; was nothing of the kind. I ordered this ring on the 12th of Dec., which I felt was plenty of time to receive it in time to make my wedding proposal on the 20th; my girlfriend's birthday*. I did make it a point to explain this to Szul, as well as to encourage them to please give me some way to track the shipment.Well, 10 days, about 5 emails and about 15 phone calls later (not to mention several strands of hair pulled out in frustration), I still got no tracking. All they did was try to tell me that the ring would arrive some time between the 17th and the 19th.I think the ring finally did arrive -- on the 22nd.She said yes, by the way, so I do guess the ring was a hit after all the agony of getting it here. <end>  Very nice people but HORRIBLE service  I bought the ring for my wife. She was coming back from a long trip and wanted to surprise her (I never gave her an engagement ring). Exactly because I had read the previous comments I ordered it with time and made sure I picked the right size. You guessed, they sent me the wrong size (they blamed it on amazon).I had nothing but nice treatment from these guys, I sent it back and they promised that I would have it back on Friday. I still had enough time so I did not worry. They had 5 more days after Friday to get it to me (Wednesday). I started calling on Friday, and every time they said I would have it next day. Today is wednesday and, of course, they promise I will have it tomorrow. Too late, I cancelled. I'll let you know how the cancellation worked out. <end>
 B0000E1M3C  1/4 ct.tw Three-stone Princess Diamond Ring ||	  Disappointing!  I ordered this ring and would like to say that I have never seen three diamonds so small in my entire life. I paid $350.00 for the ring, but even the box that szul.com shipped it in says it is only worth $99.99. The picture is misleading, so be warned that this ring is VERY TINY! My advice to all is keep looking and save yourself time because this ring isn't a bargain at all. I am returning this ring immediately because the ring is not worth the money. <end>  Excellent  it's a great ring, the only problem is that I don't see a certificate of it. Thanks <end>
 B0000E1MH5  Ribbon Twist Diamond Heart Pendant 14K Yellow Gold ||	  My Mother Loved It!  This was a Mother's Day gift to my mother and her initials just happen to be "MOM". The gift was perfect. Simple, elegant, affordable. I ordered it the Monday before Mother's Day and she received it 2-3 days before. <end>
 B0000E1MXV  Marquise Emerald and Diamond Slender Wave Ring ||	  It was a good buy  The emerald is the same color shown on the site. The jewelry came in pretty box .Green draws attention until brown clothes.Size is adequate (length 7 mm) and weight 2 grams (10 oz).The 6 diamonds shine quite . The ring is comfortable and emerald highlights.A jewelry street sells this type of jewelry more expensive . <end>
 B0000E1NQG  Two-tone Antique Five Diamonds Band ||	  Pretty...  I thought this ring was very pretty from the pictures, but the detailing was a little different when I received it. It's much too new looking to be "antique" and I really wasn't too fond of the line designs in the ring -- more "old-world" looking in the picture. The diamonds are of a nice quality and overall it's a well-made ring (although it doesn't have a lot of weight to it). I would classify it more in the art-deco era. <end>
 B0000E1VS3  Acrylic Earring Keeper - Holds 37 Pair ||	  Annoying flaw...  I have had this earring holder for over a year now, but it will soon be heading off to the church rummage sale.I thought it looked ideal, until I realized that whenever an earring fell or was knocked off it's space on the one of the racks, that it was almost impossible to pick up again from the floor of the holder. The rows are very close together, and you basically need a tweezer to retrieve any fallen earrings -- my average-sized fingers can't even come close. <end>  Earring Box Organizer  I received my order very quickly and am very pleased with it. It takes up a small space and has a clear cover to keep dust off from earrings. The earrings fit very nicely and because I keep it on my dresser, I remember to wear my earrings and put them away quickly so I know where they are. I have organized them by color in the box and it is fun to have them organized and ready to wear. It has been a good help and something I have been wanting to find for quite a while. Well worth the money and would be a great gift to give. <end>  Don't Do It... Zero Stars, Twice  I feel similarly about this item as I do about Communism  Seems good in theory, but in reality, it falls apart (quite literally)! I was very excited about this item, ordered it, and it arrived with the hinges already broken, w/the screws fallen out. Then, because I thought it was just a fluke, I ordered ANOTHER one, and the exact same thing happened, only this time, half of the back side of the lid (near the screws go) was totally split. So basically, all this item did for me was cause me a bunch of time and trouble to return. It's tempting, but my advice is find something else- stay away from this! <end>  Acrylic Earring Keeper - Holds 37 Pair  Very Disappointed! The item was Not well pack and therefore causes the product with some damaged. i feel it is not as useful as i thought. Quantity of the product also pretty lbad. Not worth the money at all!!! I will not recommend it to anyone! <end>  I love/hate it!  I have this sitting on top of the 7 drawer acrylic unit. Together they look amazing and the display of my jewelry is wonderful. However, as someone else noted, it is NOT easy to attach the earrings to holders. I have to use hemostats to hold them into place and if I drop part or all of it I then have to fish it out, thankfully the hemostats are long. There is one other very disappointing problem...the door is hinged by tiny screws on either end. After a month of very little use, the door is now falling off because the one side is split where the screw was driven into it. I should have returned it instantly but I was so excited about getting it and loading my earrings into it that I thought I could live with the problem. <end>  Fell apart  The tiny screws that hold the lid on fell out within a month of purchase.Poorly made <end>  Great Product!  I love this earring holder. I have LOTS of earrings and I used to hang them on a sewing circle on the wall, but the silver tarnished quickly since I used a humidifier in my room. This keeps them protected, and allows me to see them all at once. I love it! <end>  Earring Holder  I ordered the earring holder after my earring "tree" broke, and was pleased with it. It was shipped in a timely manner and held most of my pierced earrings as well as other jewelry items in the drawer. My only complaint is with the product itself. Some of my earrings coulden't be put on the "bars" so I put them in the drawers. This was not the fault of the product. Generally, I am pleased. <end>  Lots of Space, Need Tiny Fingers  This is a great earring holder which has plenty of space for my "every day" collection. That being said, I don't have fingers the size of Barbie's, so I keep a tweezer in the drawer at all times so I don't drop backings. The "floor" between the first two rows of holders does not drop down to the drawers, so if I do drop a back, I have to fish it out. I use the tweezers to pull backs off and put them back on. Not a huge hassle, especially considering it's easy to store the tweezers and you get used to it really quickly. I love being able to see what I have though, without having to open any doors/etc. I also like that it's wide and not tall, as I don't have a lot of vertical space where these are kept. <end>  Organize your stuff!  I love this case. A friend had this same case and i liked the fact that you can see thru it. All of my earings were in boxes and i had to search thru them all to find the one i wanted - now i can see them all thru this clear box - it is really a great thing and - No MOre Boxes!! <end>  Nice but smaller than expected  The quality is very good but size is smaller than expected. That may be just as well, you don't really want a huge case like this in your makeup area. <end>  Acrylic earring holder  This is great. You can see your earrings and there is room for bracelets or necklaces in the drawers. I bought one for a gift and liked it so much so I ordered another one for me. <end>  I need to exchange it for another exactly like it. It arrived with a part broken. It was not opened until Feb 14th.  My grandaughter loved it exactly what she wanted but a small part that keeps the lid on was broken off and inside the case itself.. I would like to replace it with anotherr one like it.Constance C Cook <end>  Nice little case  however if you wear longer earrings than I do, they won't &#34;hang&#34;, not even on the upper row. And it's impractical for post earrings unless you have very slender fingers. Well made, and I like the see through case. <end>  Works great  Very nice organizer. Stores a lot of earrings and accessories, and the see-thru design makes it easy to find what you're looking for! <end>  Good gift for the price  For the price, it's a pretty good gift along with some earrings. Hard to fish out earrings if they fall below the racks. <end>  Excellent Container  This is a clean, sturdy and well-designed container for your earrings. If you're like me, you dug around in boxes and drawers every day to decide what to wear and only wore a few pairs out of expediency. This container will allow you to find all your earrings easily so you can enjoy them. <end>  Perfect!  My friend loves to make jewelry - especially ear pins. This case allows me to easily view my collection while keeping them dust free. <end>  Acrylic Earring Holder  I love this earring holder. It holds just the essentials that you wear regularly, without having to pull your entire jewelry box out (the one that you keep the good stuff in. Because it's clear, you can see exactly what you have and where to find exactly what you want to wear for the day. Only problem I found is that if you happen to drop something, it is a bit difficult to retrieve, but what woman doesn't have tweezers....Problem solved.I do think that given the fact the box is plastic (probably cost mfg'r $4.00) and it will eventually get scratched up no matter how well you care for it, It's a bit pricy. It really should sell for a lesser price.All in all, I'm very happy with this earring holder and would recommend to others. <end>  See at a glance...  I got tired of a crowded jewelry box, looking for a matching set and forgetting what I hadn't worn in some time. With this Acrylic Holder, all the "dangle" earrings are on display and easy to get at. It does not take up much space and yet does hold 37 pairs of dangle-drop or regular pierced earrings. The three rows are staggered so you can see what's there and are easy to get out, without dropping, if you go slowly. I can see where if you do drop one it might be a bit difficult to reach, but either a long pair of tweezers or an old crochet hook should scoop it up okay. The two bottom drawers will hold a few necklaces or your watch or just more earrings. I think this is a really handy way to keep them together and it's fun to see the ones I'd forgotten that I had and wear them more often. Good deal! <end>  The Best for Earrings!  I bought this earring holder years ago, so long ago I don't even know where I got it. Ever since I've been looking for another one to supplement my first one. Just today, I stumbled upon this on Amazon. I'm so excited. I have a lot of earrings and this makes it really easy to find the pair that I want. I've put it on my wish list, and I hope someone will give it to me. In any case, I'll probably buy one for my daughter. <end>  earring case holder  I purchased this as a gift for my friend. I own one - and she loved the case, quality - and the amount of earrings that this case holds. Its great for any decor because its clear acrylic. <end>  nice item  It's a unique jewelry box and a very nice item to give as a gift for friends. It arrived on time. No complains here, very happy with it. <end>  Earring Holder-Clear Acrylic-Holds 37 Pairs! (Clear) (10"W x 3 7/8"D x 4 1/2"H) (Purchased on 02/27/2009)  Nice size earring holder, and just what I wanted. But, when my order arrived one end of the acrylic holder was cracked. Not sure how this happened. But I am willing to reorder and give it another try. <end>
 B0000E1VVT  Jewelry Box (Clear) (8"W x 5"D x 3"H) ||	  Wrong Description!  Even though the box itself is roomy, beautiful and functional, the description is incorrect. There are only two drawers, as a matter of fact it's a one rawer (bottom) divided into 2 compartments. The top section is not a drawer. It works as a usual box  the lid goes up. Although it's still very nice, it doesn't serve my particular needs  I needed exactly a unit with drawers, as I put another jewelry box on top of this one. I still decided to keep it, because I put some stuff I don't really wear much in the top section, and in a way it did solve the problem, however, I just wanted to point out that if you need it as only the drawer unit, it may not serve you well. <end>
 B0000E6I1K  18k Yellow Gold 2.5mm Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  Wedding band  Lovely weight and shine. I use it as a stacking ring with a couple of other rope ones. Am pleased with the quality. <end>

A wonderful earring jacket with just enough "bling" to make even your plain studs look expensive! I loved them so much I bought my mother a pair for her birthday. Like all jackets, they require nimble fingers to put them securely in your ear. <end>

 B0000ES5H9  14kt Italian White Gold Box Chain. 24&quot; ||	  Perfect  i ordered a white gold fleur de lis pendant from macy's and found that the chain was not of great quality. when the ross-simons order finally arrived it was the perfect compliment to the pendant. thanks. <end>

 B0000ES6QK  11-12mm Cultured Pearl Stud Earrings In 14kt Yellow Gold ||	  Disappointment  These pearl studs are okay, but unlike the picture. The truth is that the size advertised is correct, but the studs are button style, meaning they are flattened in the back. No where is this mentioned in the description before buying; however, it says so on the back of the box, specifically  11-12mm freshwater pearl earrings, button style"! Also, although Amazon gives you one shipping date, Ross-Simons gives another and Ross-Simons is the correct date. Altogether, a disappointing purchase for me. <end>
 B0000ES8C8  14k Yellow 5 Sapphire And Diamond Hearts Necklace (17 ) ||	  Beautiful necklace  The necklace looks as good in person as in the photo. The stones are clear and good color. It sits well on the neck. <end>
 B0000ESGMN  14.80 Ct. T.W. Cz And Sterling Silver Tennis Bracelet. 8&quot; ||	  Beautiful  I love this bracelet and get nothing but wonderful comments when I wear it. This item was purchased from Amazon.com <end>
 B0000ESKF0  8 Sterling Blue Topaz And Sapphire Flower Bracelet ||	  Sparkly &amp; Pretty- an impressive amount of gems for the price  I got this for my birthday a few weeks ago and I really love it. The icy blue topaz really sparkles and is a nice contrast to the sapphires.The clasp has a safety on it and is easy to work.I took off one star because the sapphires are quite inky &amp; dark--darker than I like. But on the other hand, what do you expect in this price range? <end>
 B0000ESKWJ  8 Sterling Silver Garnet Bracelet ||	  Bracelet nice, clasp is a problem  I purchased this bracelet from Ross-Simons before seeing it here. It's a pretty bracelet, however, the clasp was flawed, and broke. When I contacted Ross-Simons about the clasp, they said they'd exchange the bracelet. Seemed reasonable, as the bracelet is nice and all I wanted to know is if they stood behind the product. I sent the bracelet in, and *surprize* got a check in the mail. In subsequent contacts with them, they said the bracelet was out-of-stock. These contacts have been very unsatisfactory, no bracelet was &quot;exchanged&quot;, and I am out shipping costs. <end>
 B0000ESQD3  Bezel-Set Multi-Gem Necklace In 14kt Yellow Gold. 30&quot; ||	  somewhat satisfied  This necklace was a lot smaller than expected for the price paid. Will not make any other jewelry purchases. <end>
 B0000EVVO0  18k Yellow Gold 2.5mm Comfort Fit Milgrain Plain Wedding Band, Size 8.5 ||	  Great Product for the money!!  Have been wearing the ring from the day it arrived. It has held up great, no tarnish or fading or wear showing. It was a great purchase!! <end>
 B0000EVX16  14k White Gold 2.5mm Milgrain Half Round Plain Wedding Band, Size 4 ||	  Good ring for the price  My husband bought this for me to accompany my engagement ring. It is a good ring for the price. It's simple and comfortable. <end>  Simple. Elegant. Affordable.  Simple and elegant. The milgrain edge adds a touch of sophistication and the half round band gives the ring more interest compared to flat milgrain bands. It's also wears very comfortably on the finger. The price is great for a 14K gold band. Only wished it had more size and material(like 18K or platinum) options. But overall a great classic wedding band. <end>
 B0000SWZL4  Sterling Silver Polished Rolling Ring, Size 5 ||	  Nice, but watch the size  I ordered this ring in my normal size. Each individual ring fit, but when put together as a whole ring, the angles made the ring too small. It is very light; it doesn't feel solid. Still, I plan on reordering one size larger. <end>  Not so good  The ring was pretty good at first, but then it got all these scratches. The shininess went away easily. <end>  Sterling Silver Polished Rolling Ring, Size 5  I really liked this ring but I never wear it because when you wash your hands it rolls right off LOL <end>
 B0000SX1OY  14k White Gold 9x7mm Oval Peridot w/ Diamond Accent (I-I1 0.06ctw) Ring, Size 5 ||	  Ring as advertised  The ring was a gift for anniversary and my wife loves it and wears it often, it has held up to frequent use. <end>  Wonderful, Excellent, Great Purchase  This was wonderful, I was skeptical but a great purchase. I will be purchasing jewelry from Amazon again. It was eactly like the picture showed, no flaws!! I'd recommend it to anyone. I have had so many great compliments on it. <end>  Surprising Quality  I was a little more than hesitant buying jewlry online, so needless to say I went with the cheaper gem stones. The ring was delivered within the time line that was promised, and I was surprised to see that the stone had a brilliant green color and there were no visible flaws or inclusions. The 14k white gold was very shiny and the diamond side stones were of good clarity and color. Overall, it was a good buy. <end>
 B0000SX2HA  14k Yellow and White Gold 5 Stone Shared-Prong Band (1/4ctw, I, I1), Size 5 ||	  Cute diamond stacking ring  This is a slim ring with very small diamonds. But it is well-made and the diamonds really sparkle. Although it is smaller than I had expected I am really pleased with it. I use it as a stacker ring and it really adds a punch without over-whelming the other ring. <end>
 B0000T2PI6  14kt. White Gold, 2 ct. tw. Diamond Unity Ring (Size 8) ||	  Scarafice of quality...you get what you pay for  I bought this ring in the store with a very good color (F) I could see a visible white inclution in the store but only when I looked from the side. I even went out into the mall to look at outside store light. When I got outside there were two huge inclutions in the center stone even visable from a distance and a black inclution in a side stone. SO bottom line...you get what you pay for. Also I saw other rings in the store the same style and price but were L-M color. <end>  not enough info  need the 4 c's please on all of your jewelry <end>

While I browsing Amazon's Jewelry store, this ring definitely caught my attention! Although I was looking for a diamond setting I found myself going back for a second and third look at this ring. In the end, I purchased two rings - the diamond and this aquamarine.Littman processed the order within 24 hours and shipped it FedEx 2nd-Day at no charge.I gave my wife the aquamarine when it was delivered. She loves it! The diamond ring will be a "little extra" surprise for her birthday.P.S. Be sure to click on the "See Larger Image" link to really appreciate the beauty of this ring. <end>
 B0000T7R52  10kt. White Gold, .08 ct. tw. Diamond Promise Ring (Size 5.5) ||	  Cute  This ring is a lot smaller than it looks. It also contains what appears to be a chip on the inside of the band. However, after going to the store itself, and examining other rings, I came to learn it is just the logo of the ringmaking company. I do wish the logo was not there though. The ring is also too thin for engraving. Overall, the ring is cute and simple. Nothing special. <end>

 B0000U05YQ  14k White Gold Princess Cut Classic Solitaire Ring (1/2 ct, H, SI2), Size 5 ||	  Great Value!!!  I recently bought this ring for my fiance. It is a beautiful ring and was much less expensive than what we saw at local jewlry stores. I highly recomend this product.I was however shipped the incorrect size, however I was reimburssed for the cost of having it resized at a local store. Dispite the problem with the ring size, I received great customer service and prompt replies. <end>
 B0000U2RCO  7.5 Sterling Flat Black Rubber Three Open Cubic Zirconia Squares Bracelet ||	  nice, but shippings almost as much as the bracelet.  This is a nice bracelet.

I purchased this for my engagement ring, to clean the ring with soap before putting it in an ultrasonic cleaning machine.It's pretty good, but it IS just soap! Also, I wish it came with a little brush so I didn't have to scrounge around for a toothbrush to use to clean with.But the service from the seller was really fast, I had the product in only a couple of days. <end>  Great Stuff Skin Friendly  This stuff was great. I have used other cleaners and had accidently left a silver ring in one that turned it black, ouch. NOT This. All natural plant derived product. After sitting down and cleaning a jewelry box full of silver, gold and platinum rings and necklaces, my hands were actually softer, felt like that Old TV commercial.

They love it, too. Highly recommended. <end>  Best sparkle and shine - all jewelry  This is the best cleaner I have used either in the jar or in my sonic cleaner. It even makes my costume jewelry sparkle. I highly recommend this to anyone. <end>  Not worth it!  I think I'll stick with soaking my diamond ring in hot water with liquid detergent. I left my ring in there overnight, ran it under water, blow dried it - etc. and still not as new/shiny as my at home method.I think I'll just stick to visiting my jeweler to clean my ring on occassion. <end>  This product is wonderful  I bought this at a home and garden expo about four years ago and am now ordering a refill. It is the best jewelry cleaner I have ever used. It is gentle, can be used on all types of jewelry, and does a beautiful job. <end>  powerful cleaner yet nontoxic--a winning combination!  How happy I was to discover my favorite jewelry cleaner is now available through Amazon. I first bought it about 7 years ago at a display at the state fair and fell in love with it. It's made of plant-derived ingredients, not harsh chemicals, and has a clean, not-perfumey smell. It works great--I drop my wedding ring in it overnight (although this is much longer than needed) and it sparkles as if I'd stopped at the jewelry store for a cleaning. Recommended highly! <end>  Really Great Product! Glad I finally bought it!!  Well, it took me a while to buy this product because I thought it was pricey. I finally took the leap and bought it and am very glad I did. This product cleans all of my jewelery very well. I soak my rings for few minutes, rinse and dry and they sparkle brilliantly! You will not be disappointed with this product. <end>  Great Product  I was initially hesitant to purchase this product because I had not done much research besides reading the reviews on this site (although it sounded promising!) I was looking for something to use on my diamond post earrings--they have quite a few crevices on the backsides of the posts that I've always had problems keeping clean.Needless to say, I'm extremely happy I decided to order this jewelry cleaner because after a short soak, my earrings were sparkling. Although I have yet to try using the solution on any of my other jewelry, I can imagine that I would be just as pleased with the results. <end>  This stuff is great!!!  I have used lots of cleaners in the past, but this one is the best so far. I can leave my wedding set in the jar overnight, and the next morning, the diamonds look like new. My husband will even drop his ring in the cleaner to shine his wedding band.I would recommend this product to anyone. <end>  Love it!  I bought this product to clean my new engagement ring. Not only does it actually smell good, it really works! My friends comment how sparkley my ring always is, I recommend it everyone! <end>  not so great  I was not satisfied with this product at all.I used a product before that only required putting the jewelry in the solution for 15-30 minutes and it came out radiant. With this product, I left my ring in overnight, had to scrub it with a toothbrush, and there were still traces of "build up" in some of the crevices of my ring.It was way too expensive for the less than satisfactory results I received. I also emailed the company to let them know I was dissatisfied and asked for a refund (since they say they have a money back guarantee) but never received a reply.I was also annoyed it was around $5.00 for shipping but all I got was an empty plastic container, a "refill" packet, and directions on how to make the cleaning solution.If you want this product, just get the refill packet instead of the whole thing. <end>  Left a sticky film on my ring  I really wanted to like this product. It smells great. I liked that it says it is "good for the environment" but it is not very good at cleaning jewelry. I soaked my ring, scrubbed it down, rinsed it, dried it off, put it back on. Then the next day I saw it in the light and it looked dirtier than it had BEFORE I cleaned it. Like it was covered in sticky oil with a bunch of lint. It took soaking it in ammonia and water and scrubbing it again to remove the film. Tada! Sparkling clean! No thanks to the folks at Gemcare. I'm going to stick with good old fashioned drug store ammonia based cleaners and trips to the jeweler ever six months. <end>  Best gem cleaner ever  This cleaner does an extraordinary job cleaning diamonds, enhanced diamonds and all gemstones, precious and semi-precious, without scratching the stones. It is gentle enough for pearls and opals, yet powerful enough to bring back the sparkle in all gems, even antique gems in antique settings. Highly recommended! <end>  Presious stones  This handy cleaner works well with jewelry that cannot be placed in a sonic clearer. The soaking basket makes it easy to put in small jewelry <end>
 B0000U3YAS  Deluxe Jewelry Cleaner Care Kit. Diamonds And Pearls All Natural Jewelry Cleaner and Radiance 2000 All-Jewelry Precious Metals Tarnish Polish work together to Renew All Precious Jewelry. Image was taken after the included refill packet of Diamonds and Pearls Concentrate was poured into the original jar and filtered or distilled water was added. This plant based, natural cleaning solution safely cleans and protects all precious, semi-precious and costume gemstones. Radiance 2000 Tarnish Remover Polish is key to safe renewal of the original jeweler buffed finish on precious gold, silver, platinum, titanium and palladium jewelry. ||	  Amazing Products!  In January I had a condo fire, and much of my jewelry sat in water for two weeks until I was allowed back in to recover my possessions. I hate the way other jewelry polishes and tarnish removers ruin my nails and make such a mess, so I ordered. It's AMAZING!! It removed all the tarnish and "grossness" and cleaned up without harshness, and best of all, was gentle on my hands. The residue of the creme silver polish just rinses off, and I swear my fingers felt softer. The liquid cleaner got all my pearls, as well as my semi-precious gemstones back in tip-top shape. I'm a customer for life!!! <end>  Great Product  I bought this in hoping that it was like a product I had found at a Rodeo a few years back.The product isn't the exact same but it works great and I have been very pleased with it!!!You do have to buy some distilled water to actually mix the liquid but not a big deal.The polish is also a very great product. My silver / gold jewelry is so much cleaner and sparkles a lot more!!!Thank you for a great and quick service. The product made it to me in like 2 days after ordering!!!! Thanks again!!! <end>  Great product  This is a wonderful jewelry cleaning product that I have used for years. With the new formulation you add your own water to the Pearls solution, so you are not paying for the water only the cleaner. It is a great value and lasts a long time. <end>  Good Stuff  The cleaning paste and liquid do a really good job cleaning jewelry that has been really hard to get clean before. <end>  Great buy and works wonders on jewelry  I discovered this product while attending a bridal show, the sellers were doing free cleanings/demonstrations. I was amazed by this stuff, I used to just take my stuff to the jeweler to be cleaned. Not anymore! I can do it at home and more regularly with this care kit. I use a soft bristled toothbrush to apply the cleaner and gently brush all over, I then rinse it and let it soak for a little bit in the blue solution. If a particular piece was especially dirty I let it sit for a few hours before rinsing again and drying. I've tried other jewelry cleaners and this is by far my favorite. The containers may seem small but a little goes a long way. My first care kit lasted me 2+ years. <end>  Gentle cleaner for jewelry  I love this cleaner! It leaves my jewelry sparkling and I like that it is very gentle with no harsh chemical smell like many other cleaners. The Radiance 2000 restores an amazing shine to my pieces. <end>
 B0000UYZGA  Sterling Silver Opal Triplet And Cubic Zirconia Ring Size 5 ||	  Extremely nice for the price!  This is a very eye-catching ring and looks like you spent WAY more than $19.99 for it. The stone is a nice deep color with flecks of green and red fire, and the CZs are really sparkly. I also like the fact that the sterling is rhodium plated so that it matches my white gold and platinum jewelry. <end>  really beautiful ring  I bought this ring for my Mom because it's sterling silver as she is allergic to gold. It's a perfect size and the opal triplet is dazzling. I think I'm her favorite son now. <end>  AWESOME OPAL  THE OPAL IN THIS RING IS AWESOME,DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PICTURE,MORE OF A DARK MOOD RING COLOR WITH FLOATING SPECKS OF FIERY COLORS,I HAVE A LOT OF OPALS,SOME SIMULATED,SOME REAL,BUT THIS OPAL TRIPLET IS THE MOST REAL THAT IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE CZS,BUT I WANTED THE OPAL AND IT WAS WELL WORTH THE PRICE. <end>
 B0000V1EK4  Platinum 4mm High-Dome Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 5 ||	  Costs less than the Metal itself  I just got this appraised and my appraiser verified that it was Platinum (acid test) and based on the value of Platinum on 5/12/2008, you could melt this ring down and it would still be worth more than the $510 it costs.On top of that it appraised for over double what I paid ($510) actually more than triple... <end>

 B0000V1EP4  Platinum 5mm High-Dome Comfort Fit Plain Wedding Band, Size 10 ||	  Beautiful wedding band that has held up well!  This is an unbeatable price on a platinum wedding band. I bought this for my husband 3 years ago and it still looks great. We looked at bands in several jewelry stores and this one looks just as nice as those and the style is more of what we were looking for. It is comfortable to wear and is a good solid weight for a men's ring. I would definitely recommend this item to someone looking for a platinum band. Of course I think it would be a good idea to try some on at a store to be sure of the size and width you want. <end>
 B0000V1EVI  Men's 14k Two-Tone 7mm Celtic Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 8.5 ||	  Sturdy, clean lines, 14K  I chose this ring over a couple of other two-tone Celtic bands available, my love gave it to me for our handfasting. It's exactly the measurements described, but looks and feels a little bigger in-person than estimating the 6mm width with a ruler. Has a good weight, stamped inside, "Novell 14 K HANDMADE." Beyond that, it's beautiful. The yellow gold really glows against the white gold edges. A little bigger than the average "lady's ring," it could work for a lady or a gent. <end>  My Husband Loves This Ring  My Husband and I just got married on June 9, 2007. I gave him this ring when we exchanged vows. I did a lot of searching for this ring and Amazon had the best deal. My husband gets so many compliments on his ring. Because it is beautiful and unique. It is high quality too. Thanks Amazon. You helped to make our day perfect.Laura <end>  A Classic Celtic Eternal Knot Band.  An eye catching combination of style, quality and statement. The Celtic knot is often symbolic of eternal love. It could be a wedding band, or wear it to show the ladies your romantic side. <end>

 B0000V776Y  8mm AAA Quality Japanese Akoya cultured pearl earring studs set in 14K yellow gold ||	  Akoya cultured pearl earring  I purchased this item for my wife and she really enjoyed. It goes well with her pearl necklace that I purchased for her earlier. <end>  beautiful pearls  These pearls are more beautiful than imagined. They have great luster and are so attractive to wear. Many compliments!!! <end>
 B0000VGMNS  1/4 ct. tw. Diamond Heart Pendant in 10K Yellow Gold ||	  Not so good  This product is not as good as it looks in the picture. the &quot;1/4 ct diamond&quot; are actually some very small dim pieces, and dont shine at all. the lace is very slim, easily broken. <end>  Good Stuff  This is a perfect gift for a boyfriend who doesnt have time to go out and go shoppping, either way, who wants to wait in traffic and lines? this is perfect, it come to like $64.14, and its at ur door relativily soon, free shipping too. good stuff mang. <end>
 B0000VM9GM  14K white gold 8mm Black Tahitian cultured pearl pendant ||	  Don't buy from American Pearl.com  The pearl was kind of nice, but the chain it comes with looks very generic. Also, the service I got from American Pearl was the worst I have ever had on the web. First of all, they charged me for two pearls when I only ordered one. Then I tried to contact them and they took two weeks to get back to me just to tell me they would get back to me. As of now, I am filing a claim with Amazon.com to retrieve the funds American Pearl charged me. If I were you, I would not buy from American Pearl, it will just be a hassle. <end>
 B0000VMCG4  Large Sterling Silver Claddagh Ring ||	  Quality!  I wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring. When it arrived, I really was in awe of just how beautiful it is! It is a larger, more bold ring - definitely more masculine. This is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love.It's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12. Hopefully I can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice! <end>  Perfect  The first review on this ring set my heart on buying it for my boyfriend, and he loved it! The picture isn't nearly as beautiful as the ring is in person, and it's the perfect size for a man to wear. <end>  Claddagh Ring  I ordered this claddagh ring for my boyfriend as a graduation present, and it came in today. (Exactly a week after I ordered it, 2 days before the estimated arrival.) It is absolutely gorgeous! The packaging it came in is perfect for giving it in as a gift. It is the perfect size for a man to wear. I'm afraid it might be a little small, so I'm hoping it'll be able to be resized. But it is of great quality, looks very solid and shiny. I'm very happy with it!I plan to order the smaller one for myself soon, after seeing the quality of this one. So I would definatly order from this company again. <end>  pleased  )  The reviews really made my decision easy. My boyfriend had been wanting a claddagh for a while now, so I took the holiday as an opportunity to get him one. I compared prices and quality a good ammount and this seemed to be the best option. It got a little close to Christmas even though I ordered it Nov 25th. I was worried since the tracking info wasn't updating further than "shipped". I called UPS, USPS, and even emailed Something Silver. UPS and USPS were really no help at all, but the reply from Something Silver seemed geniune and they really wanted to make sure I got what I paid for. The ring came a day later and I was very relieved. Its really beautiful and my boyfriend loves it. <end>  really nice ring  this is a really really nice ring. it's nice and clean looking, wonderful high-polish, and a nice weight to it. perfect for men or any lady who likes a larger ring. <end>  great claddagh ring for a man!  I bought this for my boyfriend based on previous purchasers reviews. They were right! The picture doesn't do it justice. It is a great size and quite manly, which is a little hard to find sometimes with these rings. My boyfriend is a firefighter so he's pretty hard on his jewelry and so far it has held up quite well. <end>

 B0000VMFUM  Kit Heath Celtic Double Trinity Ring ||	  Great ring!  I actually got this ring from an Irish store around my town, but I have to say, it's one of my favorite rings. It's lasted awhile without getting scratched at all and still looks very polished. It's high quality and sturdy. I wear this ring several times a week and just absolutely love it. <end>

 B0000VO0VE  St Louis Gateway Arch ||	  Gateway Arch SS Charm  I lived in St Louis prior to moving to SA, TX and wanted an arch charm for my James Avery, started, charm bracelet. James Avery has many TX related charms but nothing for STL. I found this one on line and read another review that liked her purchase inspired by a visit to the arch. It is high quality, was a good fair price, and delivery was very timely. It is a big larger than some of my charms, but I love it. I would recommend it to others. I have another STL Arch charm that I got in STL and it snags clothing, so am having it removed from the bracelet. Of course this one, that snags on towels and clothes, my hubby likes and thinks my new one looks like a small bottle opener......his fashion taste is very conservative and lacks luster, so what does he know?! I love this charm! This charm does not sang or catch on clothes....another great feature to a woman! Order and enjoy! <end>  Great quality charm!  I have begun collecting charms that reflect a the architecture of the cities we visit. I didn't find an arch charm while in St. Louis so I was very glad to have found this one through Amazon. The charm is very good qualiyt, reasonably priced, packed well and arrived in good time. Thanks! <end>
 B0000VRI04  Sterling Silver Arizona Charm ||	  Nice charm, but terrible clip  The charm looks very nice and went well with the charm bracelet my wife has. The downside to this is that the circle connector that comes with the charm very easily gets separated and the charm falls off. We had to go to the hardware store to get something a little more stable so that it wouldn't fall off and get lost forever. <end>
 B0000VRIQ8  Marcasite Ring (size  5) ||	  lovely and unique ring  I am thrilled with the quality and the look of this ring. Everyone compliments me on it. It is very eye catching. I can't stop admiring it. <end>

 B0000W56AM  1/10 Carat Princess Diamond Solitaire Pendant in Platinum ||	  1/10 carat princess diamond solitaire pendant in platinum  Very small and delicate, this is exactly what I wanted. My wife loves it. It's hard to find anything in platinum at a decent price. <end>
 B0000WM2O0  1/4 CT Two-tone Art Deco Diamond Engagement Ring ||	  great ring, not so great service  For the price, the diamond that comes in this setting, i felt was impressive. it has some fire to it, and it's raised in the setting [not shown from the angle that this picture is taken at -- making the ring MUCH taller than one would imagine], to catch light not only from the top, but from the bottom and sides as well.Again, this image is deceiving. The ring is a lot taller than shown here. Overall the rest of the ring is of good quality as well; the gold isn't cheap or flimsy. I liked it, but it was not what I was expecting.The, &quot;expidited shipping&quot; was nothing of the kind. I ordered this ring on the 12th of Dec., which I felt was plenty of time to receive it in time to make my wedding proposal on the 20th; my girlfriend's birthday*. I did make it a point to explain this to Szul, as well as to encourage them to please give me some way to track the shipment.Well, 10 days, about 5 emails and about 15 phone calls later (not to mention several strands of hair pulled out in frustration), I still got no tracking. All they did was try to tell me that the ring would arrive some time between the 17th and the 19th.I think the ring finally did arrive -- on the 22nd.She said yes, by the way, so I do guess the ring was a hit after all the agony of getting it here. <end>  Very nice people but HORRIBLE service  I bought the ring for my wife. She was coming back from a long trip and wanted to surprise her (I never gave her an engagement ring). Exactly because I had read the previous comments I ordered it with time and made sure I picked the right size. You guessed, they sent me the wrong size (they blamed it on amazon).I had nothing but nice treatment from these guys, I sent it back and they promised that I would have it back on Friday. I still had enough time so I did not worry. They had 5 more days after Friday to get it to me (Wednesday). I started calling on Friday, and every time they said I would have it next day. Today is wednesday and, of course, they promise I will have it tomorrow. Too late, I cancelled. I'll let you know how the cancellation worked out. <end>
 B0000WM3IK  1/4 ct.tw Three-stone Princess Diamond Ring ||	  Disappointing!  I ordered this ring and would like to say that I have never seen three diamonds so small in my entire life. I paid $350.00 for the ring, but even the box that szul.com shipped it in says it is only worth $99.99. The picture is misleading, so be warned that this ring is VERY TINY! My advice to all is keep looking and save yourself time because this ring isn't a bargain at all. I am returning this ring immediately because the ring is not worth the money. <end>  Excellent  it's a great ring, the only problem is that I don't see a certificate of it. Thanks <end>

 B0000WMC3Q  Sapphire Antique Ring ||	  Really pretty setting, but fragile stone.  I really loved this ring. It was gorgeous, but the tanzanite stone came chipped/scratched (I tried returning it to get it fixed, but it came back in the same condition, so I gave up) and later cracked completely in half.  ( I don't wear it anymore, because the stone will likely fall out sooner or later...I'd really recommend this ring (because the setting is so pretty - and so was the tanzanite, before it broke), but only in a stone that's harder (do a wikipedia search for "Mohs hardness") than tanzanite is (sapphire or emerald or ruby or something) <end>  Really pretty setting, but fragile stone.

 B0000WMHQI  Morning Glory Oval Opal & Diamond Ring ||	  Absolutely Beautiful  The Morning Glory Oval Opal and Diamond Ring is a must have. The opal is beautiful. The diamonds that suround the opal are wonderful too. The diamonds are a wonderful eye catcher if the beautiful opal does not catch the eye first. It is everything a woman could ask for in an opal and diamond ring. If you love opal with diamonds this is a beautiful piece to own. <end>  Gorgeous!  The diamonds sparkle and the opal, which is NOT lab-created, has lovely fire in its pale depths. This ring is lovely! <end>
 B0000WMK1A  Antique Trillion Peridot and Diamond Ring ||	  Better than expected!  The ring was shipped fast and it beautiful. Better then expected! <end>  Review of ring  Very nice ring. It was smaller than I thought it would be - but very pretty. <end>
 B0000WMLGE  Peridot and Diamond Heart Shaped MOM Ring ||	  Kindof dinky  Cool. But the metal is very small as if it should be on a child's hand. I would prefer my mom have a more noticeable ring. <end>
 B0000WMRVI  Two-tone Antique Five Diamonds Band ||	  Pretty...  I thought this ring was very pretty from the pictures, but the detailing was a little different when I received it. It's much too new looking to be "antique" and I really wasn't too fond of the line designs in the ring -- more "old-world" looking in the picture. The diamonds are of a nice quality and overall it's a well-made ring (although it doesn't have a lot of weight to it). I would classify it more in the art-deco era. <end>
 B0000WN7J4  Two-tone Infinity Diamond Men's Ring ||	  Beautiful ring  This ring is beautiful! Everyone that I showed it to thought that I had it custom made. I was worried about diamond quality and size at only 1/2C for 7 diamonds, but they are white and clear and huge (almost too big- at some angles overwhelm the infinity- much bigger in person than pictured). My only concern is the elevated twist and larger diamonds make it look a bit feminine. But this ring has everything I ever wanted and looks like the drawings my husband and I made of our dream ring. I am going to a jeweler to see if I can have the twist inset since it is a separete piece. Otherwise, diamonds are mounted flat and ring is absolutely stunning. Can't beat the price anywhere usually runs $600+ (I've been watching this ring for our anniversary for 4 years!). Completely recommend.Since purchasing, I took the ring to a jeweler and had the raised infinity section lowered into the band. They only charged $75 (and I had picked it up during a $50 off sale!) and it looks exquisite and masculine. My husband loves it and we still can't get over the fact that I found the ring he designed online. <end>  Perfectly Beautiful Ring!  Both I and my new husband love this ring! It is elegant, unique, and tasteful - yet manly! (And that's a tall order...) It is the perfect ring for my new husband! He's received MANY compliments on it. It's not too flashy or gaudy, very tasteful. We are extremely pleased with this purchase. (I was very hesitant to buy something as important as our WEDDING ring online without actually seeing it.) The diamonds are beautiful. I am not a jeweler, but I don't see any flaws in the ring. It is quality craftsmanship. <end>

 B00012CVUO  Men's 14k Two-Tone 6mm Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 8.5 ||	  Scratched by anything  This ring is really cool looking and is exactly what I was looking for....unfortunately it started showing scratches on it from the first time I put it on. There is no way to keep it from getting marked up. the simple act of opening a door with a metal knob will create a mark. I went with 14k gold because I figured the higher base metal content would help keep it from getting marked up but no luck. This ring will show wear and tear like you wouldn't imagine. I wouldn't purchase it again. <end>  Exactly as described  I bought this for my husband and he loves it. Comfortable and looks nice. <end>  Great Value, Scratches Easily  I bought this ring as a wedding band for my husband since he wears a silver watch and a gold necklace, so the two-tone style was perfect. It is super comfortable and looks great, but be warned that it does scratch easily. We've been married for 7 months and it's definitely taken a beating. We're hoping that we can get some of the scratches buffed out, but my husband doesn't really care either way! <end>  Excellent  This is a very sturdy, affordable ring. It won't scratch, fade, or bend. It is excellent for someone who doesn't want to worry about breaking rings and having to get them repaired. If you aren't used to wearing a sturdy ring, which can bother some people, you might want to get something with smoother edges. <end>  gorgeous!!  we were quoted $700 for this exact ring at our jeweler, and to find it on here for $225 is amazing! its has a good weight and is really nice looking. we aren't getting married until December so it won't have any wear until then. if there are any problems i will amend my review. <end>

 B00012CVXQ  14k Two-Tone 6mm Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 10 ||	  Reflective Quality...  This item is simply beautiful. I chose it because of the reflective quality of the two-toned metals. The white gold, my preference for the pure beauty of silver and the yellow gold, his preference for the strength of gold. the polished, smooth metal and the contemporary design, makes it the right pick for the recently engaged or the happily married! <end>  Classic  I absolutely love this ring, just looking at it gives you the sensation of touching the silky sheen of it and the delecately contrasting colors embrace the modern while still staying faithful to the traditional. its perfect! <end>  disappointed  I fell in love with the picture. The ring showed to be sligthly brushed looking. When the ring arrived I was quick to learn the picture looks nothing like the ring. The ring is a bright polish and the yellow gold is barely visiable. I'm very disappointed with amazon for the lack of description. <end>  Nice simple band / ring  This is a very nice, simple, classy, ring for men. The white gold is the primary focus and the yellow gold is very subtle - which gives the ring its class. It is polished and reflects what you see in amazon's picture. I am not sure what the other's who gave this one star were complaining about. The picture shows a shiny ring and that is exactly what I got. As far as quality goes - it is a gold ring and is without flaws. If it was flawed I would send it back and wait for the replacement to write a review. Amazon always has great customer service and they want you to be happy.Nice ring!!! <end>  DTip  Excellent quality, I got exactly what I expected, a fine-looking band for a very reasonable price. <end>  Pretty ring, but beware.....  I was very happy when I first saw this ring! It fit, looked great on my finger, and then BLAM! there was the defective portion. There was a very noticeable anomaly on the white gold part, a blackish smear that was obviously a defect in the process of dyeing the yellow gold to white. I thought about exchanging it for another one, but figured, &quot;You know, Amazon just recently launched their Jewelry department. If their Quality Control is so bad as to send the customer a defective ring, they don't deserve a second chance!&quot; Sorry Amazon, do better and you just might succeed. <end>

 B00012CW08  14k White Gold 6mm Hammered Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 10.5 ||	  14K White Gold Hammered Ring purchased from Amazon  The picture doesn't do this ring justice. I was very skeptical of buying it because the price was so low. Yes I've shopped around A LOT! So..for the money, definitely worth it. Comfort fit and sizing is pretty true to normal sizing. The word amazon is however stamped on the inside of the band if that's going to bother you. Otherwise go for it! <end>  Georgous  This ring is wonderful. It looks excellent on my husband's hand and is definatly worth the money! <end>  Great ring  I looked at similar rings at local jewelry stores ranging from $500-$700 and decided to go a different route. I found this ring and thought it was a good deal and went ahead and purchased it. It turned out to be a GREAT deal! It is a quality white-gold ring with good detail and does not have AMAZON stamped on the inside. It is a good weight without being heavy. My new husband loves it! <end>  Very nice ring  Good quality. Nice finish. Good for a man that uses his hands alot. <end>  Good product. Slow shipping  The ring is sturdy enough and hasn't shown any signs of decay. While the product was great the shipping was not. We intended to use this for my wedding but the order was back ordered and amazon didn't tell me. Here we were getting married and we had no idea when the ring was coming. I had to use a dummy ring for the ceremony and this ring arrived about 1-2 weeks later. This is the third time amazon has done something like this to my husband and he refuses to shop here anymore. <end>  Great Ring, Great Price!  I am very pleased with this ring. No surprises when I opened the package, as the ring looks exactly as it is presented on the Amazon website. Excellent quality and an excellent price! It was nice to have such a large selection to choose from on Amazon, and at this price I saved enough to purchase a 'backup' in case I lose the first one! I looked at similar rings in brick and mortar jewelry stores, and I have to say that their prices are MUCH higher.I can also attest to the fact that 'Amazon' does not appear anywhere on the ring. The only thing on the inside is the stamp 'W_14K' to indicate the material composition of the ring.Purchase this ring; you won't be disappointed. <end>  Great ring  After losing my first wedding band (long story) I looked around the web and found this one. Thanks to Amazon Prime I got it right away. I've been extremely happy with this ring. I like it so much more than my original. The color, shine, and texture are all very nice. I think this ring has a sophisticated, but not flashy look. Also, it doesn't have Amazon or anything similar stamped on the inside. It does have "W_ 14k" stamped on the inside, but that's it. Anyway, a great ring. <end>  My Mikey likes it!!  This ring exceeded our expectations. Came very quickly and my fiance, Mikey, is very anxious to wear it. Packaged very nicely. <end>  Simply Elegant and Handsome  I just received the ring I ordered for my future husband and it is PERFECT!! <end>  GREAT RING, GREAT PRICE  NO AMAZON PRINTED ON THE INSIDE OF MY RING. I LOST MINE AT THE BEACH AND FOR THE PRICE TO REPLACE IT I AM VERY VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ONE! AFTER LOOKING IN LOCAL JEWLERY STORES FOR THEM TO ORDER ONE SIMILAR TO THIS ONE I WOULD HAVE PAID ALMOST DOUBLE THE PRICE. LOVE IT <end>
 B00012NOZK  Amethyst necklace, 'Mermaid Spell' 14.2" L ||	  Thanks  From the moment my sweetheart gave me this necklace and put it on for me, it hasn't come off. I can't possibly part with her, not even for a minute. I find myself spending a little more time in front of the mirror now days, just staring at this beautiful mermaid around my neck.She catches everyone's eye, everywhere I go. Friends who know my fascination with mermaids always say just how perfect it looks on me, and I even find alot of strangers complimenting it's beauty, but it's not surprising.. she's hard not to notice.We also loved the way it came packaged, in a cute cushioned box, and with a friendly postcard from the artist  &quot;Good morning from Bali!&quot;I think I'll send a picture wearing this necklace, to show that she's loved and kept warm.Thanks for making this wonderful necklace, it's definately my most prized posession! <end>

 B00015VKEE  Blomdahl Ruby Medical Plastic Earrings ||	  Great earrings!  I have very sensitive ears that even the most expensive silver and gold irritates them. These plastic earrings are the only ones I have found I can wear. They are great, I highly recommend them to everyone. <end>  Good earrings for sensitive ears!  The earrings are for sensitive ears and they do fine as long as I take them out of my daughter's ears every couple of days. This is the only product I have found that she can wear. <end>
 B00015VKFI  Blomdahl Sapphire Medical Plastic Earrings ||	  Really good - solved nickel sensitivity and infections  My eleven-year old had her ears pierced for her birthday with 14 karat gold studs and had nothing but problems for over two months. The holes did not heal and she kept getting infections in one lobe or the other. We were at the point of giving up and letting the holes heal closed. Our first mistake was not simply throwing away the "antiseptic cleaning solution" that the store sold us. It was little more than sudsy water for seven dollars a bottle.We started using standard hydrogen peroxide solution diluted 50% with tap water every evening, and occaisionally using triple-antibiotic cream. That cleared the infections, but the holes still would not heal normally!Then we found these medical-plastic earrings on Amazon while we were actually looking for the titanium earrings. We bought one pair of each kind, plastic and titanium. The results with both have been excellent! No more infections, the holes have healed over nicely, and the titanium posts are not causing any metal sensitivity-reactions.Be aware that the posts of the plastic earings are almost twice as thick as the metal posts, so start with the plastic earrings. Also, the plastic backs slide off more easily than the metal backs because there is no "groove" in the plastic posts - this is a good thing. It allows easy access to the clean the post and earlobe without pulling too hard on the earring or earlobe, allowing the healing process to continue uninterrupted until it's finished, about 4-6 weeks.They also look great! <end>  Best Earrings  These were the best earrings--my daughter developed a reaction to her peiced earrings just after getting them done we tried everything even plastic earrings. These are the best. I was able to put them in and within a few days the puss from her ears went away and she is now able to have "pierced ears." I also love the "medical titanium" ones even better. If you have sensitive allergic reactions to metals definately give these a try. <end>  Great.  Lovely plastic earrings that don't bother my ears as much as the metal ones do. Yay. Good product and price is okay. <end>
 B00015VKGW  Blomdahl Rainbow Medical Plastic Earrings ||	  Great earring my daughter can wear.  My daughter has had allergic reactions to every type of earring out there. We have tried 18 K gold, sterling silver, stainless steel, nickle free. No matter what, her ears would become red and infected within days. She has had these in for 1 month with NO PROBLEMS!Thank you for allowing her to wear earrings again. <end>  Highly recommend!  I love these earrings. I have bought multiple pairs from Blomdahl. My little girl looks so pretty in them. I began using them after my pediatrician recommended them when piercing my daughter's ears. She has never had a reaction to them. She has been able to pull the backs off of them and we have lost a couple pairs, but I'd still buy them. I bought a couple pairs for my neice who has a terrible nickel allergy and she has never had a reaction to these earrings. I highly recommend these earrings. I didn't realize it, but a nickel allergy is usually developed during the first year after getting your ears pierced. If you stay away from all sources of nickel (i.e. Use medical grade plastics) during that initial first year, the chances of developing a nickel allergy are very slim.... <end>  Awesome Earrings on Amazon  My granddaughter is allegic to all metals and could not wearany jewelry. These earrings are plastic and look expensive.She loves them. What a find! Thank you for making theseavailable on Amazon. <end>

It is cheaply made although the photo on the listing makes it look far nicer than it actually is. It's one of those items you could pick up for under $5 on Ebay. Thoroughly disgusted when I opened the package that I was going to put on a nice chain for a gift. Instead I threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money. <end>
 B00016PUSK  Emerald and Diamond Earrings in 10K Yellow Gold ||	  POOR QUALITY EMERALD EARRINGS  I ordered these earrings for my wife for Christmas. The emeralds are very, very, poor quality, don't even look like emeralds, they are milky white, nothing like the ones represented on their web site. I contacted Fred Meyer Jewerly, explained the problem, I can return them, but I have to pay the return shipping and insurance. I feel that since the stones were so badly miss represented, that they should pay the return, but they refuse. I will never order from thenm again. <end>
 B00016PUT4  Sapphire and Diamond Earrings in 14K White Gold ||	  Great Gift  Gave these Earring to my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved them!You can't go wrong with these earrings, the Blue Sapphires are exceptional! <end>  Well made but Sapphire color is nothing like the photo.  The color of these in the photo show a nice bright blue but the actual sapphires I got were a dark grey-blue.

It gives the impression of a very expensive ring. It looked really large to me in the picture, but it is of average size. If you like Iolite, you will really appreciate it. <end>  Love this ring !!!  This ring is really an eye catcher as the other person said that reviewed it, it looks real big but it is a perfect size,I would like to buy it in a larger size for someone else hint gemworks !!! <end>

 B00018MOO6  British Virgin Island 1 Cent "Green Throated Caribbean and Antillean Crested Hummingbird" Two Tone Coin Cut Out with 18" Chain from J&J Coin Jewelry ||	  Fantastic necklace!  This small coin makes an exquisite necklace! Don't know how they can cut out most of the coin without breaking it. Fantastic quality ... it looks just like the picture. I love it so much that I just ordered another coin necklace with a different picture. No one would know this is a real coin unless you show them the reverse side with part of a person's face behind the large bird. What a great way to make beautiful jewelry! <end>

 B0001EZDE8  1/10 ct.tw Princess Diamond Solitaire Ring in 14k White Gold ||	  Smaller than I thought but..  The ring is really small; smaller than I had originally thought but does have a nice shine and sparkle to it. I know its a relatively good quality diamond and cut, that is why its worth it, but I guess I did not realize just how small 1/10 ct is. However, the ring was perfect for my needs (and I looked around) and you cannot find another bigger or better one in the same price range. So, I am quite satisfied with my purchase. <end>  good service  i actually got the ring sooner then i expected. the first one was a defect but they have great customer service and totally replaced the ring and also refunded my shipping charge!!! excellent. will buy from again <end>  DONT BUY  THIS RING IS VERY VERY MISLEADING.

Just what I was looking for. <end>  smallish  its smaller then expected but it arrived earlier then expected and my girlfreind is happy with it. so i have no problem with it at all <end>  Very Very pleased!  I couldn't believe it. The ring is fab. Of course its not that big, but hey, its only 140 dollars! It is a beautiful ring though. Not only does the ring seem perfect for my girlfriend, but the shipping, was so fast. They said it would be shipped on the 21st, yet it came on the 20th! now, thats what I call service. This is probably the smartest purchase I have ever made. <end>  What's up w/ the photo?  This pic makes the ring look like it's a 2 carat diamond! 1/10 is super tiny, so this pic is very misleading. The diamond in the photo is very large when compared to the setting, yet 1/10 of a carat would be barely 2mm x 2mm! Not to mention the clarity is horrible and the color isn't much to brag about. <end>  Szul Stinks!  Szul Customer Service will lie to you and overcharge you. If you do business with Szul, there's a good chance you'll get screwed! <end>  Beautiful ring, and I got it free!

 B0001EZUE6  1/2 ct.tw Princess Diamond Solitaire Ring in 14k White Gold ||	  Not worth the money  I was very disappointed when I recieved this ring. While the stone was very nice, the setting looked very cheap and flimsy. There just was not enough gold thickness anywhere and it looked like it would be very easy to bend or be damaged in everyday wear. Besides getting bent, I would worry that the stone might pop out of this setting too easily as well because the supports for the stone were not very substantial either. While the price of this ring was reasonable for the size and quality of the diamond, I really think a much better quality setting could have been used to hold the lovely stone-the setting cheapened the whole look of the ring. This ring was pretty to look at but I would be afraid to actually wear it! <end>

 B0001HYT1I  10kt Diamond Raised Cluster Ring ||	  Dissatisfied  I sent for this ring in anticipation of giving as a birthday gift to my dear friend. The package arrived on time and delighted I opened it only to find another ring and of inferior quality. Repeated calls to J@R Jewelry World and their referenced party have yielded nothing but extended waiting on the phone and then disconnection. I am outraged and surprised that Amazon does business with firms of this kind. I really hesitate to order anything anymore. Am waiting to recover from a bout of cardiac arrythmia so I have not been able to get to the post office but I hope to do so within the 30 day limit. This was a $140 expense and now I will have to pay to return it.G.Cannavo <end>
 B0001J0NR0  14kt. White Gold, 1 ct. tw. Diamond Anniversary Ring (Size 5) ||	  It is stunning!!  When we were shopping for wedding rings, I wanted something that was simple, but elegant. Because I have small hands and my profession prevents me from wearing anything too gaudy, I wanted a flat surface (nothing with prongs, etc.) and something that stood out, that was different. This ring caught my eye instantly - the way the diamonds sparkled - I was sold even before trying it on. There were two other sizes (1.5 ct. and 2.0 ct.), but our wedding budget was tight and I was content with the 1 ct.; I also opted for yellow gold. On my wedding day, my husband placed this ring on my finger; much to my surprise, it was the 2.0 ct.!! We recently celebrated our 1-year anniversary, for which I received a diamond anniversary band that is a perfect match. This ring is absolutely exquisite and is very versatile (wear alone or with baguettes, princess cut, etc.). The compliments never end!! <end>
 B0001LHCPY  Art Deco Style Sterling Silver Filigree .25ct Cubic Zirconia & Diamond Ring ||	  Beautiful!  This ring is 100 times prettier in real life than in the picture! If I didn't know better, I'd swear it was an antique piece. The ring is well made, beautifully crafted and the detail is amazing. I have small hands and the ring is petite, has a low profile, is extremely comfortable and exactly what I wanted. I would recommend this ring if you want something small and understated but still amazingly beautiful. <end>  Absolutely BEAUTIFUL!  I received this ring as a Christmas gift and it is absolutely the most beautiful ring EVER. I wanted a ring that did not stand up too high, which can catch on things, and this one is perfect. The design is even more beautiful than the photo---when viewed from the side, one can see through the intricate, delicate silverwork, reminiscent of a beautiful old bridge.Knowing that these rings are not mass-produced, but are cast individually upon order, from genuine antique molds, makes it all the more special. My ring was made especially for *me*! Precious beyond compare.The rings available at the local jewelry stores cannot compare to this ring. Oftentimes my son and I have passed a jewelry store advertising rings of $1000 or more that aren't half as lovely. You could not get me to trade this ring for any of them!I simply could not ask for a more beautiful ring. I think I fall more in love with it every day. <end>  Beautiful  My husband surprised me with the ring and it is so pretty and petite. For a person with a small finger it looks good. <end>
 B0001LW1AK  Art Deco Style Sterling Silver Filigree Frosted Crystal & Diamond Pendant ||	  Beautiful  This is a beautiful piece. I love to wear it. It will dress up any outfit. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the chain is very weak and breaks easily. -- Misty Lomas <end>
 B0001M15PQ  White Cultured Pearl 18-inch Strand (6.5-7mm) ||	  Wonderful strands of pearls!  I love these pearls! I bought 4 strands for Christmas 2004 (2 years ago). I bought one for my birth daughter, one for my adopted daughter, one for my daughter-in-law, and one for me. I told all the girls that the women in our family are very strong and we'll all ware these pearls which will be a symbol of our great inter strength. The pearls have made a wonderful bond between us. All of the girls love thier pearls and will treasure them always. These pearl strands are beautiful and they've held up to being worn almost daily. <end>
 B0001M7YH4  Sterling Silver Crystal Bracelet, 7" ||	  Poor Quality!

This bracelet was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my mother in law. I paid $160 for it and was extremely disappointed when I received it. It was about to fall apart. and very cheep and fake looking. I have contacted the Company Palm Beach Jewelers and they have guaranteed me a full refund upon shipment of the product back to them. I will be shipping out this weekend and hopefully they refund me as promised.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED  ( <end>

 B0001WIB4Y  Pugster Drop Pearl White Work & Leisure Italian Charm Bracelet ||	  Nice enough  The attachment link that attaches the pearl to the bracelet link is rather cheesy and weak. If the pearl part snags on something you could consider it gone probably. But what could you expect? <end>
 B0001WIC1G  Pugster Framed Palm Tree Travel & Flags Italian Charm Bracelet ||	  Pugster has great charm  I just started an add a link bracelet. I can't really afford to buy the expensive charms so I bought a couple from Pugster and a couple of cheaper ones from a store in the mall. The quality of the pugster charms is really really good and the detail is amazing. The cheaper ones I bought at the mall fell apart within 10 minutes of me adding them to my bracelet so it was really a waste of money trying to save money. <end>

 B0001WIEZK  Pugster Heart Grand Daughter Italian Charm Bracelet ||	  Seemed straightforward enough...  I expected to receive a similar product to what I had purchased in the past. A small heart birth month stone slightly raised. Instead it is a small cheap piece of plastic with a huge flaw in it glued to the link.I bought it in advance of our 2nd daughters birth, and originally bought the December stone which was twice as nice as November. I am highly disappointed with what was sent.What can you expect for $10 I guess. <end>
 B0001WIFGI  Pugster Golden Italian Charm Bracelet Dolphin Spring Fashion Jewelry ||	  Gold Dolphin Charm  Love this charm. Simple and classic depiction of the eligance and grace of a Dolphin. My daughter loved it. Stands out just enough to be notice, but not enought to be easily scratched. <end>

 B0001WIHVQ  Pugster Holland Girl Italian Charms Bracelet Link ||	  nice charms.... very slow customer service.  I ordered two charms from pugster. I received a package with only one of the charms and the invoice for both. I attempted several times to call. Then to email. They took a long time to respond and then asked if i had looked thru the entire envelope..... yes, i did.They eventually mailed out the second charm and they are nice. It was just a headache trying to get a response from the company. <end>
 B0001WIJTG  Pugster Dachshund Dog Photo ||	  Dachshund Beauty  The detail on this picture is really stunning. I was really surprised - pleasantly so, when I received this charm.

 B0001X5BPK  Filigree Spanish Lace Turquoise Pendant w/18 inch Chain ||	  Worth every cent  I purchased this necklace 9 or 10 years ago. It is gorgeousand I would recommend it to anyone who admires quality and beautyin their jewelry. <end>  nice, but just okay  The necklace is pretty; the filigree appearance of the silver around the turquoise is attractive. The turquoise stone itself does not appear to be real, although the ad for the necklace says that it is. <end>
 B0001XA7IG  Heart Shaped Locket in 14kt. White Gold with Diamond Accent ||	  Just the right size for a pendant!!  I got this for my birthday and I love it. The diamond accent is just the right touch to make the piece more beautiful. As for the pictures, I used the ID pictures of my son that come with the photo package at Wal-Mart; they fit great. It is about half an inch long and it is not water proof so remember to not wear it in the shower (the pictures wash away)!! I also put mine on a different chain because the chain was very thin. <end>

 B0001Y0RF8  Moonlight Classic Titanium Band for Him & Her. On Sale this week! ||	  Gorgeous and nicely priced  It looked very nice in the picture so we went to the nearest jeweler and got our sizes and ordered. We didn't expect the rings to look quite as nice as pictured but they do. Very impressive quality. Very distinct appearance. <end>  Titanium is the new Gold  I ordered these for my wife and I. We had them made in two different widths, which you can do if you contact the seller. Rings were even better than expected  The finish on these particular ones is a deep lustre that is as beautiful as any white gold; besides that, these are much less expensive, three times as durable and will not cause skin allergies like the nickel in white gold does in about 1-in-8 people!The service I received from DiMarco was very courteous and prompt. A+ <end>  Scratches really easy  It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture. But within a couple of days I could start to see that it was getting scratched even when I was being consciously extra careful. After that I figured it wasn't going to make much of a difference whether I was careful or not. That made life lots easier. <end>  Perfect 10!  The Customer Service and the ring both get 5 stars.My husband took his time to pick his ring, by the time he finally did we were a few weeks close to the date.I emailed their customer service and Magda was right on it.She was able to get the ring to me in 4 days time.Which was a lot faster than the company he ordered my ring from.The Ring was gorgeous.Very Shiny and it has held up well.It was not too big and not to small.Very practical! <end>  titanium looks great on men  my husband and i were impressed. shipping was expensive but signature is required. came in a little burgandy bag that topped off the feeling <end>
 B0001Y0RY4  Magnolia Titanium Wedding Band Set. Choose your Color for Free! ||	  I loved these at first!!!  My husband and I were a week away from getting married and still could not agree on our wedding band set. We came across these and instantly fell in love with them.. I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched.. I thought titanium was the strongest metal and that if wouldn't scratch... The seller is trying to work with us to make us happy.. I guess we'll see. <end>

 B0001ZPWAC  X - Roderick Tenorio Southwestern Sterling 14-Karat Gold Unisex Band Ring ||	  Durable, Beautiful, Meaningful  Hello!I've had this ring since Roderick Tenorio first advertised on QVC on TV. This ring has last me about four years now, and going strong. I had a skin reaction with lots of turning green and peeling (allergic to nickel, I think- not sure), but after that initial discomfort, my finger has a nice little spot that shows I've had a ring on for quite a while.The ring itself is beautiful. Love it, love it. I work at a job where I'm always using my hands, and this ring hasn't even gotten scuffed up yet, which is incredible given what I've put it through. I can't praise it enough, and I feel naked without it. I still get compliments on it too! A truly beautiful piece. <end>  Perfect ring for a man or woman  Roderick Tenorio Southwestern Sterling 14-Karat Gold Unisex Band RingThis ring is of the highest quality and I would recommend it for a man or a woman, and even as a wedding band! <end>

My only tiny complaint is that the large silver lock in the back is a bit uncomfortable on my skin. <end>

 B00020V2N2  Onyx 18k Gold over Sterling Silver Cameo Ring ||	  Great Product, great price, speedy service  This has to be one of the prettiest rings I own. I love cameos and this one is very nice. The little faux diamonds sparkle beautifully and nobody could miss it on your hand. It is very large, but also comfortable to wear. If you love large rings like i do, this is perfect. It covers the top part of my right hand pointer finger but does not go past the knuckle. It's a great price for a beautiful piece of jewelry. <end>  Face was not centered on black stone...it was low down..  I have seen almost identical rings to this one that are real that go for a couple of hundred dollars. So when I saw this for $20.00 I was thrilled. When I got it and opened the box it was immediately notable that the mother of pearl looking cameo face was very very off centered when glued on the black stone. It was lower than it should be. I will return this ring most likely. If it were centered it would be pretty but you can see a very slight glue edge. As I said for the price if the face were in the center I would keep the ring. Very disappointing. The shipping however was extremely fast and I liked the free cleaning cloth that was included. <end>

 B00022C8W4  White Gold Pave Diamond Earrings in White Gold (with Safety Lock) ||	  too small  We purchased this earrings for our teenage daughter based on the measurements listed on the specifications section. To our surprise the earrings were much smaller, maybe for a little girl. We purchased SecureHoop earrings before with the same measurements and are very happy with the size and quality. But in this instance we had to return them for a refund minus shipping charges. Even after we pointed out the incorrect specifications. <end>

 B00022RGTY  Sterling Silver Multicolor Amber Medium Size Teardrop Ring All Size ||	  Beautiful ring!  This ring is simply beautiful. I got a size too big and the customer service was great. I was afraid the design was going to look too gaudy on my finger, but it looks classy and elegent. THe longer amber goes to almost the knuckle, but it's SUPER comfy and definitely not intrusive. <end>  Beautiful  This ring is very beautiful. The package showed up ultra fast and was well packed. The amber is absolutely gorgeous and the silver is stamped. The setting is not curved to conform to the hand. I'm not sure if that is intentional or if it is machine pressed and assembled. Even so, this is a lovely piece. <end>  As pretty as the picture  Very Pretty Ring. Wear it on my index finger. I chose this ring because I thought it was unusual and not something you see every day. <end>  AMAZING  I love amber, I do not think people appreciate how it is made how old it is and the work of the elements to make such gorgeous and unique pieces of amber. This ring is a STEAL! For the price I get a classic amber, green amber, and a gorgeous yellow amber.it fits perfectly, looks lovely and goes with nearly everything. Want to buy more for a few friends who love mine. <end>  Gorgeous  Beautiful gem stones, really rich looking, and the silver is lovely but a little less elegant than some silver pieces I've gotten. Nonetheless I'll be wearing it happily. <end>  Cute ring!  This is a nice ring, with large enough pieces of amber. The ring is average size on top and the design is original. The silver seems of good quality.Unfortunately it's a bit too big for my middle finger. (I ordered a size 8 since I need a 7)It came in a lovely purple box!I'd recommend it and would recommend this seller. <end>  Perfect for me  Got this to wear on index finger, looks great, especially for price. Also got bracelet to match. Look nice together, although bracelet stones a bit small for me. <end>  Nice size, pretty, but could be better  Color I received was not green, honey and gold amber. I got green, honey and cream/clear amber.Like the size of the ring. I have small hands but like good size rings.This one is visually noticeable and is quite pretty so I am keeping it.However, this ring is rather cheaply made.The ring is a simple thin silver circle with the amber teardrops set on top.No design or heft to the band itself.The teardrops are attractive in shape and size.But like other reviewers, I wish the teardrops hugged the shap of the finger.The three teardrops are connected in a flat manner and would not allow adjustment to curve downward.Ring would be great if it had slight curved shape.I ordered this with matching teardrop shaped tri-color earrings from same companyCertified Genuine Multicolor Amber Sterling Silver Pandora Dreams Leverback EarringsAnd the earrings are terrific.Shipping was fast, well packed. <end>  Love  I have not taken this item off since receiving it..I get compliments about it always...Love..Highly recommend..for the price as well. <end>  Really pretty  Really beautiful ring though the teardrops contain imperfections so symmetric to be real and make the amber look as fake. The green color is obtained applying a coat of something at the base. <end>  Teardrop Ring  I love the teardrop design and the three shades of amber in this sterling silver ring. It's exactly what I expected it to be. <end>  Okay  The ring is okay. Wish the stones were set more contoured to your finger. The fact they're not make the product seem cheap. <end>  Satisfied....but  I was satisfied with the ring, but for some reason I thought it would be a little bigger. It has nice gems, and is really a nice quality ring. Wish Amazon would model their rings on hand models so that one would have some idea of the size of the ring, especially when there is no carat weight listed. <end>  amazing  I was so excited to get this ring. When I finally got it, I was like OMG this ring is amazing. I love it. <end>

 B00023JJXE  The See Clearly Method ||	  Good program but needs comittment  i ordered this program cause i was sick of wearing glasses and wasn't so keen on surgery.It is based on the same principles as the william bates method nfor eyesight improvement , i did the excersises and i have to say i could actually feel my vision improving i could go easily without my glasses my vision is -3.5 .however i stopped doing it wen my semester exams started , and my eye sight went back to what it was .but im planning to restart the program and stick withit till i i get to my goal vision.i would recommend u to buy it if u are willing to commit atleast 35 mins per day for atleast 3 months. <end>  great program  I purchased this program in 2001 and used it with success. I was interested in using it since my eyes weren't focusing as well since I turned 42 years of age. When I was 3 weeks into the program I was able to throw out the "cheaters" reading glasses and maintained the results by exercising once a week for since. I highly recommend this program and recommend it to everyone. Just follow the instructions and you can measure your own success. <end>
 B00023JN0I  Large 2" Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Cross Pendant ||	  Inspirational Celtic Knot Pendant  I found this to be a great size to wear, its not to heavy and has good shine and contrasting texture. I would give this to a friend. <end>  One key flaw  The issue I ended up having with the cross, is the loop for the chain is only bent together and not a solid piece. What ended up happening to me is that the loop kept opening and the cross would fall off. It took a little while before it started to happen, but the effect kept compounding to the point where I couldn't wear it anymore. Besides that though, it is very nice. <end>  Stunning Silver Cross  This was recieved fairly quickly.The silver is genuine and is stamped on the back as such.It is very light and extremely shiny.  )I wear it every day.Love the Celtic Cross. <end>  Celtic Knot Cross  I am pleased with my purchase of the Celtic Knot Cross. It goes well with my antique sterling chain. The 2" cross is just the right size. My only concern is the bail. It is only bent to adhere to the chain and seems to be sturdy. However, one piece of the bail meets the other and over time I wonder if it will open and I could lose my Celtic Knot Cross. One should be aware of this when they purchase. <end>  Perfect purchase  Item was just as described, even nicer. It was a gift and came packaged ready to present. Would definetly buy fro them again. <end>  Large but Lovely  I'm in love with Celtic design and this cross is a beautiful example of a specific type of knot work. It is fairly light and despite its size it is easy to forget you're wearing it (a bonus for me). The only misgiving I have is that I find the cross is a little too big. This is not the fault of the seller, I just didn't think clearly about what two inches would look like. <end>  Silver Celtic Cross  Beautiful Sterling Silver Celtic cross and chain! It looks exactly as pictured and described on site. The quality of craftsmanship is excellent. I used expedited shipping and order was here within 3 business days. Am very happy with the product! <end>  Cool  This is a really nice Celtic cross in a larger size. Well worth it. <end>  2" Sterling cross  The cross arrived in great time and my husband loves it. Thanks a million. A+++ <end>

I purchased this necklace with a pendant and it matched up perfectly,but I'm a pretty stout guy and it just didn't fit. It was my error,but I do not regret buying it at all.So here's the summary beautiful necklace, your getting more than you pay for,just not the necklace for us larger guys. <end>  love love love this chain !!!!  great value for such little price.will recommend this seller to all of my friends.fast shipping.....product as described!!keep up the good work <end>
 B00023JOPM  Large Sterling Silver Mens Gothic Cross Ring(Sizes 9,10,11,11.5,12,13,14) ||	  a masculine ring for someone who may not normally wear a ring  I first found, and bought, this ring in a booth at a large 'biker' event - Bikes, Blues and Barbeque - a fe years ago. I'd been wanting a ring for some time, but never found anything that appealed to my tastes - masculine but not gaudy or overbearing/overlarge. I've gotten numerous compliments on it from strangers....and was sad to let it go when a lady-friend asked for it as a keep-sake (lol).I missed it and wanted to replace it, but was skeptical that I could find anything that fit 'me' so well. I began searching Amazon under men's rings..and I was thrilled when I found the exact ring here.This ring actually even sparkles - glinting off the edges - in sunlight. I gave one to my best frined for his birthday the other day and his wife and daughters love it on him. <end>
 B00023JP2E  Small 5mm Wide Sterling Silver 7" Double Link Chain Charm Bracelet ||	  Charm Braclett  I bought thee of these for my Granddaughters. I was worried, because of the price, that they would look cheap. I was so wrong. The quality is great and they look like I paid 4 times as much. If you want a really nice gift, these charm bracletts will be great to add to. <end>  beautiful!!  I was going to buy the same exact one for double the price at piercing pagoda and when this one arrived I was so happy I found this one on amazon!! amazing bracelet! <end>  Sterling Silver Bracelet  The bracelet arrived within 3-4 days. It is delicate and double strand, just what I needed for my eleven year old granddaughter. <end>  good quality  Unfortunately, the bracelet (that is pretty) lost the link between the clasp and chain on the third time my daughter was wearing it. I tried to contact the seller and exchange the item for a more expensive one. The new bracelet(rolo) is a very quality one. I actually almost bought the same bracelet in a shopping mall for three times the price. My daughter end up with a better quality bracelet and I am very satisfied with the transaction. <end>  Lovely  I love this bracelet. It's sterling silver, which is the main jewelry type I can wear. And it goes nicely with the charms I have been collecting to put on it. I did have to change the clasp on it, but that is no fault of the bracelet or designer. It is the fault of my fingers that can't maneuver such clasps. It is a good bracelet all in all. And it arrived in good time. <end>  Casp fell off after a few wears  The clasp fell off after a few wears and we had to try to put the clasp back on but it kept breaking. My daughter is now without her charm bracelet and we are out $30. <end>  Smaller than expected  Based on the picture, I expected the links to be a bit bigger. Other than that, it looks good. <end>  Lovely dainty base bracelet for charms---CHARMING  This was used as the base for a "Bella" charm bracelet for my 16 year old granddaughter. She loved it and the quality was so much better than the premade charm bracelets we had seen. <end>
 B00023JP8I  Large Sterling Silver Filigree DRAGONFLY CUFF Bracelet ||	  Not sterling silver, silver plated pewter  Very disappointed with this bracelet. When I received it, I looked for the stamp indicating that it is sterling and saw that there was none. Looking at the back I saw that it had a rough surface, were it sterling, it would be smooth. Took it to a jeweler and comfirmed what I thought. The bracelet is silver plated pewter, NOT sterling silver. Big difference. <end>  Not Sterling Silver  My husband gave me this bracelet and, after one day's wear, it turned my wrist green. So he used a magnifying glass but couldn't find the Sterling mark. Although he did find that one of the wings was slightly broken. Beautiful bracelet, but not sterling silver. And trying to return the bracelet is turning into a nightmare of hassles. <end>  Dragonfly cuff bracelet  Large cuff bracelet is beautifully made. Delicate silver work is nice and the price was very reasonable. <end>  I love this bracelet  I am really pleased with this purchase. I love the beautiful detail of this piece. I have been wearing it a lot since I received it and have gotten great comments about it. It is very comfortable to wear. <end>  Bueaitful and Comfortable  I purchased this SS bracelet at the Carlisle, PA Motorcycle Rally in July 2008. It is not only lovely but comfortable. I can wear it on either wrist. I wear a 7 1/2 inch bracelet. I looked on the internet to locate the artist. I love Southwestern Jewelry. I purchased from a vendor who buys overstock inventories. [...] He is from Winston, Salem. The bracelet is clearly marked 925 which is the Sterling Silver mark. It was his only piece like that. He just got it. I was lucky to see it first. I would love earring and a necklace to go with it.Rose Martini <end>  Beautiful!  I gave this to my mother as a present, she loves it. It's a little fragile but so beautiful! <end>  Cuff Bracelet  This is my first experience with this type bracelet. It is more delicate than I expected, so I am being very careful with it so far. Beautiful design, quite detailed. I am comfortable with this company, having had good merchandise from them before. <end>  disapointed  i bought this bracelet & it was cracked when I got it. <end>
 B00023JPKQ  Sterling Silver 8mm Omega Chain 16" Collar Necklace ||	  Sterling Silver 8mm Omega Chain 16" Collar Necklace  love this thing ... I've always loved omega chains but this is my first - if I had to find fault, I'd say it bothers me that it flips over on my neck. Since this is my first one I don't know if that is a design flaw in them all or if perhaps it needs to be slightly longer or thinner perhaps 6mm - I have a skinny scrawny neck and ankles (it's the bits between that have ballooned - also a possible design flaw) I wouldn't have thought the 16" would be an issue - none the less I just keep a check on it while it's on - it is light weight and stunning when it behaves itself. <end>
 B00023JQ0A  Sterling Silver 10ct Faceted Framed CITRINE Pendant ||	  Affordable CITRINE with FABULOUS color!  The sterling and the stone in this pendant are very well crafted. GREAT quality and very reasonable pricing makes me LOVE this seller every time I look to buy...which I have done multiple times! I am never disappointed. <end>
 B00023JQ50  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Brass Shield Poison Locket Pendant ||	  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Pendant  This pendant was slightly bent on both sides when it arrived. Upon wearing it, it would come open while on my neck. I have not worn it much since. I would not buy from this establishment again nor would I purchase from the internet because of the hassle in returning the item. <end>  disappointed  this is the first disappointment from this company. all their other things so far are great. i am on the fence as to returning this one. it is attractive but it's way too expensive for what you get. the back is slightly pushed in and has scratches. it is lightweight and tinny. there is no catch to keep the locket shut so it will probably flop open. the only thing i will say that is good is that i am sure returns won't be a hassle. <end>  It's a shame , it's so pretty but it will not stay closed  I love how the pendant looks it is so pretty but one big problem, it will not stay shut, the second you put it on it pops right open makes it impossible to really wear  -( <end>
 B00023JQ6E  Sterling Silver 3mm Shiny Omega Chain 16" Collar Necklace ||	  thin omega  this omega was too thin. it kept flipping over to the wrong side. I have since ordered the 4mm and it is just great!. <end>
 B00023JQXC  Cute Marcasite Bunny RABBIT Sterling Silver Brooch Pin ||	  Very small and cute  This pin is only about 1/2 inch across -- very small, but also very cute. I love it. It looks just like the picture, but the red eye is a little brighter, a feature I find especially very nice. I like to wear it right at the neckline of sweaters. It gives a subtle, pretty, interesting touch to outfits. <end>  Bunny Brooch  This is the cutest, and I have received numerous compliments on it.It is small,cute, and wearable.It is exquisite. <end>

The quality of the jewelry is excellent. I wear the earring at least twice a week. <end>

One of my daughters suggested I check out Amazon. I did, and found the perfect set of amethyst clip-on earrings at a more-than-reasonable price. My wife loves them and her friends admire them. Thanks! <end>  Mom loved them.  Gave these to my Mom for Christmas. She loved them and they looked great on her.

Much prettier then what is available for clip on earrings. Gift for my mother. <end>

 B00023JSH6  Tall Sterling Silver Large Bikers DRAGON Ring(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12,13) ||	  search finished product  I was looking for this kind of ring all this passed summer. The product itself fits perfect and looks great with my other rings. I do with it was less chinese dragon like and it rapped around my finger but it is still cool. <end>  Awesome product....  Im quite happy with the ringm quality is amazing and totally in love with it. Thanks a lot and will keep shoppping with you. <end>  I love it!  I REALLY love this ring! I was a little hesitant about buying it because the face is a little ugly. It looks exactly like the picture. I can however overlook that, because of its other qualities. It fits nice, its not bulky or uncomfortable. It doesnt look or feel cheap. I even stepped on it, by accident of course, and it retained its shape. (my foot did not come out of the encounter so well.) If I lost it, I would buy it again. <end>
 B00023JT48  Sterling Silver Reversible Red Carnelian Green Pendant ||	  pretty pretty!  This pendant is very cute! The stones on mine were a bit darker than in the pics but, still pretty. More like Dark Rusy color/Hunter Green. The detail all the way around the pendant is beautiful too.I bought it's sister necklace too (Lapiz on front and Turquoise on back)and Love them BOTH! It's like getting 4 necklaces for the price of 2! The prices are so good though, It's really like getting 4 pendants for the price of 1 average necklace.Boo to regular necklaces. I am in love with reversibles!!! <end>  gorgeous  I just love the pendant,from the picture it looks like groundglass surface,but actually it's polished very shine,the color is richer and deeper than the picture,very classic looking,so I decide to order the turquoise and purple reversible one,the only thing makes me uncomfortable is there is not only shipping fee but also tax,recommend it. <end>  Nice piece of jewelry for the price...  I agree with the reviewer below. I love reversibles! The colors are a bit darker than in the pictures, but otherwise it's a beautiful piece of jewelry for the price. The only issue that I have with it is that the top part actually bends if you apply a bit of pressure. This is somewhat worrisome, but just treat it gently and you shouldn't have a problem. <end>
 B00023JTAC  New Sterling Silver Turtle or Tortoise Hook Earrings ||	  adorable  I love these. The only fault is a hollow back but it's hard to find solid sterling and they are super cute anyway. <end>  Adorable!  I bought 3 pair of these as gifts and they are adorable! They are small but are very easy to wear all day and look precious. The people I bought them for wear them often. Silver Insanity shipped them quickly and for a great price. <end>  Cute  The earrings are very cute, I just find them a little on the small side. Otherwise, totally satisfied! <end>  Cute little earrings! &lt;3  I liked how cute & dainty they are, as well as my bf loves tortoises, so it was win/win!  P <end>
 B00023JTOS  Sterling Silver Curved J-Hoop Marcasite Post Earrings ||	  Perfect  Just dressy enough to wear at night and just enough to wear in the office during the day. Nice weight and very good quality at the price. I have had a lot of compliments. <end>  earrings -OK  They are pretty, but the backs don't fit right so the backings slide off and then the earrings fall off (happened three times so far...lucky I haven't lost them yet). <end>
 B00023JU24  Detailed Sterling Silver DRAGON on Malachite Pendant ||	  A very nice, elegant piece of jewelery.  I was searching for something to give that special someone in my life who's into fantasy, mythical creatures, and pendants such as this. Its very elegantly carved, set well, and really went well as a gift.So, if you've got a certain someone on your list whom you love, and who loves Dragons, give them this. <end>
 B00023JUAG  Sterling Silver Dragonfly Blue Topaz Pendant with 16" Snake Chain Necklace ||	  Dragonfly  I love this necklace I have had nothing but compliments and questions on where did I get this necklace. <end>
 B00023JUB0  Large Sterling Silver Coiled Dragon on Amethyst Pendant ||	  I should pay more attention to descriptions...  I adored the look of this pendant...when looking at the pictures. Even though I read the descriptions and knew how big this was...I bought it anyway. Shame on me. Its rather unwieldy in its design and is heavier than I wanted it to be. Although it looks nice over all, I certainly wish now that it was a bit smaller or lighter. I still wear it of course, but I certainly will pay more heed next time I'm told something is this large. <end>  a great product  I'm pleased I purchased this unique pendant. It stand out and really makes the wearer feel special. I'd recomend it to anyone whos a fantasy fan. <end>
 B00023JUOW  Sterling Silver Night Owl in Tree Scene with Amethyst Moon Pendant ||	  Sterling Silver Night Owl in Tree scene w/Amethyst Moon Pendant  Beautiful pendant. I am a owl lover, and this is a lovely pendant worn on a choker collar necklance that goes well with anything. Insightful and smart looking. <end>
 B00023JV8C  Heavy 3D Celtic Knot with Symbolic Stars Sterling Silver and Black Onyx Pendant ||	  Excellent piece of art  Its very amazing because i think that it was smaller like the picture, but is very big. Excellent jewel <end>
 B00023JVB4  Sterling Silver Medieval Symbolic Hawk Bird on Genuine Blue Lapis Pendant ||	  HAWK SYMBOL NECKLACE  This is a beautiful piece of jewelry for someone that is looking for the hawk animal symbol. It has the elegance of today but the rustic features of yesteryears. I wear mine to honor my animal totem/guide.I have search for a long time for just the right pendant and this is it. <end>
 B00023JVD2  Sterling Silver Pentagram or Pentacle on Genuine Blue Sodalite Hook Earrings ||	  Great Pieces  Both the earrings and necklace are beautiful pieces. Exactly what I expected. Service from vendor very good. Got them before they were expected. <end>
 B00023JVFU  Sterling Silver African Elephant on Tiger Eye Gemstone Earrings ||	  the idea is very nice... but it's tiiiiiiiny  when i saw this, i liked it a lot, i thought of my wife and ordered it as a gift... when it arrived and we opened it i was kinda embarrassed  )it is literally very tiny... you need to come very close to the person to see that its an elephant <end>  Gorgeous  These are great earrings. Good quality but not too heavy. Get a lot of attention when I wear them. <end>  Goes with everything....  These are so pretty and well made. They go with everything and they are light in weight, heavy in apprearance. <end>
 B00023JVIM  Sterling Silver Medieval Scrollwork BLACK ONYX Earrings ||	  Look expensive  I bought these as a gift. I was happy to see that the workmanship and general appearance are very good. I love this company, Silver Insanity. I've dealt with them before. If you have questions they get right back to you and the products come fast. I use them for gift purchases often and never have been unhappy, had lots of "Wows!" from the recipients. <end>  Perfect combination  Couple weeks ago I ordered Sterling Silver VICTORIAN Twirl Drop Black ONYX Pendant and later wanted to make a set with onyx earrings Sterling Silver Medieval Scrollwork BLACK ONYX Earrings. These two are perfect combination and my friend asked me to buy them for her too. The shipment is the best I got it in the shortest time. I strongly recommend! <end>  Very Pretty.  I really like these earrings. Look better in person than online. They seem very well made. Shipping was speedy as well. <end>
 B00023JVKA  Long Sterling Silver Fairy and Amethyst Dangle Earrings ||	  style nice, quality mediocre  I bought these earrings as a gift for my mom and found them to be the perfect item for her, based the unique amethyst crystal and faerie design. When they arrived, I felt that the quality was mediocre; the silver seemed slightly flimsier than I was expecting from the photo, but I still would recommend them. My mom loves them. <end>
 B00023JW2C  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Linked Heart 7" Bracelet ||	  Very Small  This is a pretty bracelet, but it's very narrow. Even on my 6" wrist it looked small. It would be ok for a child. <end>  Disappointed  I was really disappointed with this item and it's partly my fault...it was 7 inches which is just too small for whom I intended it for. I should have thought that out better. But the item came dark in color which makes me think it was an old product, close to being tarnished. So it was just not something I could give as a gift. <end>  Great Gift  This is a really nice breacelet and is of realitivly good quality for the price. The only thing is the heart links aren't actually as big as they look in the picture. <end>
 B00023JW3Q  Sterling Silver Ferret or Mink on Blue Lapis Earrings ||	  Adorable, one-of-a-kind earrings  I couldn't resist these earrings! I love lapis and wear it all the time, and the ferrets sealed the deal; how many earrings do you find with ferrets?? The design is really great; the ferrets are much more delicate than they appear in the picture above. The little tails curled around the lapis balls are just adorable.As the earrings are quite small, a girl (perhaps eight and up) could also wear these. Any age will find these adorable. I'd buy them if I was you! Thank you, Silver Insanity. I'll definitely be checking out more of your jewelry. <end>  Sterling Silver Ferret or Mink on BLUE LAPIS Earrings  I got the ferret earrings and I was delighted when I opened the package. They are nice and light and easy on the lobes and really cute too as I am an animal lover. I love the mix of a lovely natural stone with an animal sculpture. <end>
 B00023JWD6  Sterling Silver Howling WOLF Head on Tiger Eye Pendant ||	  Wolf's Tiger Eye Pendant  This is a gorgeous pendant--as lovely in RL as it appears in the "zoomed" picture online. Made to last, and to please. <end>
 B00023JWEK  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Green Malachite Pendant ||	  Wow, what a cheap piece of crap!  The silver work was extremely crude. There were barbs of silver on the seams of the mold. The stone looked like a cheap marble my kid bought at the super market; to make it just a bit worse...the "marble" was literally hot glued in place with globs of glue at the points where it is cemented to the silver. I honestly have seen better jewelry in my daughters Barbie play set. I wish they provided negative stars in this rating system because I would give this a negative five stars! <end>
 B00023JWXQ  Sterling Silver Filigree Hamsa - Hand of Fatima Charm Pendant ||	  sweet hamsa hand  This product is exactly as cute as it looks and was used as a center piece in a bracelet for a dear friend-she wears it every day everywhere! <end>  Beautiful Hand of Fatima  I got this to replace a necklace which I lost years ago, and I couldn't be happier. It is very pretty, dainty, and elegant, and the filigree work is very detailed for something so small. I am actually considering buying another for backup, because the price is so very good for the quality of it! I love it, I am so happy with it. Also Silver Insanity ships super fast, I got my order within two days of ordering! <end>  Very pretty Hamsa!  This is a very pretty, traditional-looking Hamsa. The bale is not extremely wide but it's wide enough for a decent-width chain. I wear it on an 18" rope chain that I already had and it looks great. You can't beat the price either! <end>  Excellent service  Very nice and as shown pieces of jewelry. Will buy from you again. Thank you for the prompt mailing and great quality product. <end>  Serious price increase  I just bought one of these a few months ago and I was going to purchase another just now but since the price jumped from $9.00 to $18.00 I think I'll pass and buy from another site. This is ridiculous because it's definitely not worth that much. <end>
 B00023JX1M  Treble Clef Soprano Music Sterling Silver on Amethyst Band Pendant ||	  a perfect note  I've been looking for a symbol for my passion  musicThis sterling silver "G" clef is very pretty, hangs nicely on a longer chain and gets many compliments! The amethyst and silver are nice together. <end>
 B00023JX7G  2mm Sterling Silver 30" Diamond-Cut Rope Chain Necklace ||	  Beautiful and the price was right!  Without leaving home, I got exactly what I wanted and it was promptly delivered right to my mailbox. <end>  Amazingly Beautiful  I was hesitant to purchase silver on-line but my fears were gone when I received this beautiful 30" sterling chain. I wear it every day and it is just a shining as the day I got it. <end>  Great Service  Silver Insanity is always the place to go for silver! The chain is gorgeous and service is fast. <end>  High Quality Silver  Bought this chain for my 17 year old daughter to carry a charm on. It works perfectly and looks fantastic. <end>  Good looking and strong  The rope chain looks like the image. Good looking and strong. The 2mm diameter size is the right choice to work with the Washington Quarter holder. <end>  Really good place for Silver  Just replaced my silver chain with a 30" chain from Silver Insanity. They had just what I was looking for at a great price and I received it in the mail quickly. Great seller. <end>  Great buy!  I have worn this chain with a shorter one with charm added. It looks good alone or with the other rope chains I also purchased. I would recommend this and all the matching shorter chains to anyone and everyone. Great price and look.2mm Sterling Silver 22" Diamond-Cut Rope Chain Necklace2mm Sterling Silver 24" Diamond-Cut Rope Chain Necklace2mm Sterling Silver 20" Diamond-Cut Rope Chain Necklace <end>  NEVER RECIVED PRODUCT!!!  i never received the 30" chain i purchased i contacted the seller and they never responded until i filed a bad report then they gave me some number to track down the product. I will never buy from then ever! i should have gone on EBAY i never get screwed there!!!! <end>
 B00023JX8K  3mm Sterling Silver 16" Marina or Anchor Open Box Link Chain Necklace ||	  High quality, nice chain  This is a high quality, nice, shiny chain. It's heavy and a little more masculine, so I'd recommend it for a guy. <end>
 B00023JXR6  Tetragrammation Magical Star Talisman Amulet Pendant Necklace ||	  Importance for Meaning Tetragrammaton  For those casual dabblers in wiccan/kabbalistic talismans, I suppose this product is good for costumes. But for those that place an importance on authenticity or the meaning, purpose, and power of words, This product has a 'fatal' flaw. Even though the letters circumscribing the pentagram are a latin transliteration of the hebrew word for Yahweh (YHWH) - It should be "TeTRAgrammaton" and not "TeTRAIgrammaton". That's like getting your girlfriends name (let's say Rebecca) tattooed on your arm spelled "Rebekah". The meaning is different if mispelled (especially to Rebecca, who will probably break up with you). So consider this before purchasing. <end>  GREAT PENDANT  THIS IS A VERY NICE PENDANT AND WORTH THE PRICE, I WEAR IT ALMOST EVERY DAY.THANKS AGAIN <end>
 B00023JY2U  Unique Old World Style Sterling Silver 3-Stone Winged Garnet Leaf and Vine Necklace ||	  Old World Sterling Silver Necklace  Absolutely beautiful.

 B00023JY4I  2mm Sterling Silver 22" Bead or Ball Chain Necklace ||	  Great price!  I am very pleased with this necklace. I purchased it to replace a broken chain that came with one of my more expensive charms and the quality & beauty are just as good as something that you'd pay much more for. <end>  Pleased  I am pleasantly pleased at the quality of the chain, the ball type construction feels great, no itching or scratching, I ordered the necklace for a small pendant I have, fast shipping. <end>  22"STERLING SILVER BALL CHAIN  I LOVE THIS CHAIN! IT'S JUST RIGHT FOR WHAT I NEED IT FOR,AND IT'S STERLING SILVER,AND A BALL CHAIN JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT! <end>  beautiful chain  wonderful with a pendant or alonewho needs to pay for white gold - this chain easily passes - the finish is bright and beautifulvery fast delivery - excellent service <end>
 B00023JYDY  Sterling Silver Cute Fairy or Pixie Charm Pendant ||	  pendant  The picture of this item needs to illustrate that the PIXIE IS NAKED. I couldn't give it to my 10 year old niece, and yikes, I had to scramble for another gift. <end>
 B00023JZE2  Sterling Silver Pentagram or Pentacle Amethyst Pendant ||	  Lovely- but be aware of the construction.  Hello, to you prospective buyers!I thought I'd let you know- this piece is beautiful (if you're eyeing this, I don't have to tell you how much better it is up front in real life  ) ). It's about an inch and a half in either direction. The amethyst donut is smooth and fully polished- not a single 'sharp' spot.I know from the picture supplied in this page that you can't see the 'center' of the amethyst donut where the pentacle's center is- but it's there.Now, onto the nitpicks The donut is 'hanging' from an oval-shaped silver band where the pendant 'loop' (what the necklace is strung by, at the top). This is all well and good. HOWEVER- when I looked at the image (there should be a second pic showing the side of the item), I assumed the silver piece was attached to the front of the donut only. Not being a silversmith myself, I didn't know or notice until I received it that it's not attached at the front.This 'hanging' donut would be well and good- as it looks beautiful- however, silver is a soft metal and is prone to bending. Heck, I just had to bend it myself a bit so that there wouldn't be an eighth of an inch between the donut and the pentacle.However, that dangling space between the silver pentacle and the donut is still there- and if the silver piece behind the pendant that curls down like a fish-hook gets damaged and/or falls out, the pendant is effectively broken- with only the silver pentacle left.3 stars- lovely design (after looking at over 3,700+ pentacles all over the web, including amazon), great gemstone (amethyst- a 7 on the MOHS scale- meaning it's not as strong as diamond, topaz, ruby/sapphire, or emerald, but is stronger than talc, gypsum, calcite, fluorite, apatite and feldspar.I expect that amethyst shouldn't become scratched after a bit of daily wear from the silver in front of the donut- but I'm wary of the back of the pendant. Personally, paying about $32 for this piece (S+H included) is a bit steep given the not-too-sturdy design of the piece, but since this is the only piece with a design I like in the gemstone I like out of a LOT of pentacles, I'm happy with it. <end>  Change of heart  Since my last review I have found that this is in fact a very good focal point for circle work. <end>  Great product  Very pleased with the product and prompt delivery. Will order from this seller again. <end>
 B00023JZUG  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Bar and Chain Cufflinks ||	  Beautiful!  I'm getting married in September and it's going to be a Celtic wedding, and these cufflinks are going to be a beautiful surprise for my love! <end>
 B00023JZWE  Sterling Silver Faery or Fairy Post Stud Earrings ||	  love fairies  need i say more? these are so cute, i love them. they are very substantial earrings, might be a little heavy for some people, but i put different backs on them especially made to hold up earrings that are a little heavier and once i put those on they are just fine. <end>  Niece loves them  I got these a few years back for my Niece's B-day, as she likes Fairy stuff, and they have held up well over the years so far. So on that note 5 stars. <end>  Cute, but kind of large  I bought these for my daughter (7 years old), but they're a bit larger than I expected. The fairy itself is cute, though obviously nude, so be aware of that if you are purchasing for a child. I'm not sure if I'm going to give them to her this year, though, because they seem too large for her ears right now. The earrings are not heavy, and seem to be sturdy. I say "seem to be" because no one has worn them yet. It matches perfectly with theSterling Silver 7" Fairy Faery Link Bracelet Jewelry, which I also bought. <end>
 B00023JZYW  Marquise AMETHYST and Rainbow MOONSTONE Silver Pendant ||	  My mom wears it almost everyday!  I have not seen this item in person, but I bought had it sent to my mom as a gift and she LOVES it. She said the amethyst is dark in color and is quite large. <end>  Ok piece.  I like this piece well enough, but I'm only going to give it a 4 out of 5 because off the picture. The picture doesn't reveal that the pendant's sides stick out about a centimeter or so. The visual effect is somewhat unpleasent and the picture they show doesn't reveal this spect of the pendant at all. Still, it was ok. <end>
 B00023K08C  Saint Bridget St. Brigid Cross Sterling Silver Pendant ||	  Good quality and very lovely  My husband bought this for me after finding it on my wishlist here on Amazon. I'm very, very happy with the quality of the piece; it's well-crafted and made of heavy silver, heavier than I expected. This won't be our last purchase from the supplier, Silver Insanity!Brigid was originally a Celtic goddess who was the patroness of blacksmiths, poets, and healers; She's my favorite!Blessed Be,Julia C. <end>  Brief history and recomendation  St. Brigid is the female patron saint of Ireland. The original cross was woven from reeds for a Celtic chieftain on his deathbed. I love the detail on the pendant and would recomend this to anyone looking for a unique cross or jewelery. <end>  St. Brigid Cross  Abstracted design captures the feeling of the original rushes, better than those that try and duplicate the real thing. <end>  Very nice - but small  Make sure you realize this is a small item, but very crafted. <end>  Couldn't find St Brigid's Cross in Silver in Ireland  I heard the story of St Brigid years ago, my first visit to Ireland. My last trip I looked for it in sterling silver and couldn't find it. I can't believe I found this on Amazon. The cut is precise and just a perfect size. I bought a 20" chain as well and they are perfect together. A great buy! <end>  very quick delivery  The item was shipped almost immediately and I got it within the week - in perfect time to use it for Imbolc! Also, it was in perfect condition and beautiful. Thank you so much! <end>  Great  Have been looking for a St. Bridget cross for some time. I had one in Gold that I wore for years and just recently lost it. I was so happy to find this one in silver to replace the one I lost. <end>  Lovely, great buy  This is an example of an item that can be nearly impossible to find in a "brick and mortar" shop but is available in many colors and sizes on Amazon! I recommend this specific piece because it is the perfect size and weight for regular or everyday wear, and is very nicely crafted and durable, especially considering the relatively low price. <end>
 B00023K0LO  Diamond-Cut 3mm Wide Sterling Silver 20" Figaro Chain Necklace Italian Made ||	  Excellent  The service was excellent and the necklace is georgous! My husband loves it. It is just the right size. The 3mm is masculine without being huge. <end>  TERRIBLE  I bought this necklace and the clasp was broken. There is NO WAY to get ahold of the company except by email...which they don't answer. Total rip off!!!!! Don't buy this unless you want to throw your money out the window! <end>  This made a great gift.  I bought this necklace for my boyfriend for christmas and it made the perfect gift. It is very strong but also light enough to not bother him. He wears it all the time. I love it and it was such a good price and the shipping took no time at all! <end>  20" Figaro Chain  I purchased this Chain for my 13 year old son as a Christmas gift I was pleased with the desision I made. I had been looking for a chain for some time. It's a sturdy chain w/good weight. I will say I wish it were a little thicker. To help you out he is a 5ft 140lb football player, and I believe he'll do fine w/it. <end>  really like it!  i used to have another silver chain like this but it got kinda dark after a while(because i sweat so much while i'm playing sports). but this one is totally shiny and fine even though it's been a month since i bought it.[Update after 6 months]the chain is still shiny and i can't see any black layers on it, which to be honest i did expect it to get darker. i totally recommend this chain to other people, since it is not expensive and it's high quality. <end>  Sssssssuperb!  Shiny, Silver, Strong, Sturdy, $$$$$uper value and Speedy delivery. Sssssure was pleased with this purchase. I have one of those hard to shop for spouses so I relied on the other reviews before choosing this one. He had problems with the silver chains he was buying; they always seemed to break. This chain was not too Ssssshowy and a perfect Sssssize for the charm he needed it for. He was pleased with the gift and I thank all those that take the time to write a review of the purchases they make. I do most certainly recommend this! The price was an added bonu$$$$$. You can't beat it. Kudo'$$$ to Silver Insanity for their Ssssspeedy delivery. <end>  Pretty  I bought this for a friend as a gift. Good quality for the price. I would recommend this product to anyone <end>  Great price!  This chain looks awesome on my husband! Definitely worth its weight in........silver! The 20" chain isn' as long as I expected but is still nice nonetheless. <end>  chain  this product arrived well packed and fast i would recomend this company to friends. It writes great smoth flow and soforth <end>  Excellent necklace  Shiny and well polished look. It has its marking Italy 925. Fits great. The package could have used more taping tho because it was ripping a bit, but no complain about the necklace. I love it <end>  Better then I expected  When I opened the box this chain was so much prettyer then the pictures. I wanted something masculin for my fience for christmas, but I didn't have that much money to spend. Not only was this in my price range but I loved it and so did he. I recommend this to anyone who wants to look good! <end>  Nice silver chain  Prompt and affordable delivery (to Montreal, Qc Canada), always a good thing. Product was received in mint condition. Looked exactly as I expected. Very nice looking and shiny silver chain. Good price too. Very satisfied, I wear it all the time. <end>  picutres are deciving  ive gotten better out of a gumball machine the necklace fit around my neck with like an inch to spare its tiny not masculine at all worst buy off amazon but shipping was nice thats about it <end>

I love the idea of poison rings, lockets, etc. So Victorian... It was just like the picture. Beautiful scroll work. Ornate sterling silver, and a beautiful amber cachoban!! The open area of the locket was almost 1/2 inch in diameter. Great size to wear.I loved this pendant, and the price was great!!

They are very beautiful and i like them a lot. <end>  Beautiful black Onyx Earrings  These are beautiful earrings. Antique looking. Very expensive looking. Good weight. I love them.

 B00023K122  Sterling Silver Filigree Butterfly Post Studs Earrings ||	  silver earrings  this seller does not give the size, of the jewelry, becausethe items I got, including these earrings, were very small/tiny.These were so small one can hardly make out what they are.I asked for a refund quite some time ago and have not received it yet. <end>
 B00023K1W2  Sterling Silver Loving Fairy Couple on Green Aventurine Stone Slide Pendant ||	  fairy couple pendant  this is an unique piece!! i love it!! it gets alot of compliments!!! <end>
 B00023K2GC  Sterling Silver Turtle Tortoise Motion Spin Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Nice!  This ring is well worth the price. It's silver, so it won't turn your finger green, it's adorable, and for those who like to keep their hands busy this is perfect. It's definitely worth more than they're asking for. <end>  Nice!  This ring is well worth the price. It's silver, so it won't turn your finger green, it's adorable, and for those who like to keep their hands busy this is perfect. It's definitely worth more than they're asking for. <end>
 B00023K2HG  Sterling Silver Marcasite Marquise Amethyst Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  pretty junk  One star is one too many for this piece of jewelry, but I had no choice, as I had to enter a rating. Personally, I believe it deserves 0 stars. When I received the ring in the mail I was pleasantly surprised, as the setting was beautiful and the stone very clear. But after wearing it only a few short hours, the stone came loose, unbeknownst to me, and as I later discovered, fell out. It is not an expensive piece by any means, so I was not too put out over it, but if you are considering purchasing this item, I would suggest passing this one up. <end>  Very pretty!  Beautiful ring, however be sure not to knock it on anything... after wearing it for long periods the stone gets loose. It hasn't fallen out yet, but you can tell it is thinking about it.Even if it does, though, I've definitely gotten my monies worth! <end>  loser  the stone fell out one day after owning this ring,it is very beautiful and i would have it set again, this time much better than was shipped,but i cannot find the stone.oh i guess i won't be shopping here anymore <end>  Pretty,but shoddy workmanship....  A good price for a pretty ring...but if you are intending for a "daily wearing" kind of ring, you may want to look further.The marcasite stones began to fall out after the first few months of wear..... <end>  4 star review  I loved the elegant design and it was just as ordered when I received it. The only thing I would have wished were different was a larger stone-and wouldn't have minded paying extra for that. I really liked the unique design. I love the jewelry selections at Amazon.com. <end>  Not happy  You get what you pay for here. I think it is prettier on the computer than in person. My son's girlfriend wore it two days and it started tarnishing. She was so happy with it when he first gave it to her, so I hate that it is not holding up. <end>  Simply Beautiful  This ring is just beautiful.Very nice quality and elegance for the price.I wear it every day and recieve many compliments,including "are you engaged"? I'm not,but that should tell you how nice the ring is..And it does feel nice to hear that little compliment.&lt;smiles> <end>  This is a pretty one  The medal is shiny and the stone is pretty and clear. It is a little bit darker than the picture shown, but not drastically. I like it a lot, it is lovely and the band isn't so wide its uncomfortable, its a nice snug fit. Thank you for this nice piece of Jewelry, I love rings and love collecting them <end>  Great product  Love this product. It is very beautiful and elgante. Looks like I spent more then I did. <end>  Beautiful!! Awesome price!  This ring is gorgeous!! The stone is actually a deeper purple than what the picture shows. The style is very unique & funky - but at the same time it's dainty - which I love. I'm planning on buying the Garnet version of this ring for my mom. Highly recommend Silver Insanity! <end>  Marcasite ring, simply lovely.  Great ring, quick delivery. Happy with purchase. Lovely design and happy to have it in amethyst purple, my favorite! Marcasite is a unique style and I'm glad its making a comeback into fashion world. <end>  Sterling Silver Marcasite Marquise Ring  We bought this for our 13 year old daughter and I will agree with the other reviews that it is prettier in person than the computer picture. The amethyst is clear, not cloudy. The designs on the bands are also clear, they do not stand out on the computer picture. It's not a very big ring, I would call it dainty, but it will get noticed. We haven't had any issues with the stone, in fact, we've taken to get it sized just a little bit bigger as they do not come in half sizes and we've had not problems. <end>  poor quality of silver  First the ring is darker than it looks in the picture. The stone also looks darker and more purple. The quality of silver is poor. <end>  very beautiful.  i was impressed with this ring because it looks more beautiful thant what you see in the computer.defenitly worth it. <end>  I love it!  I love this ring! I bought it as a present for myself and am so glad I did. The marquise is beautiful and the Amethyst is a nice cut and not cloudy. You can't beat this price either! The only negative comment I could give is that the setting has two sharper edges that my boyfriend has complained about when holding my hand- but it hasn't hurt me! <end>  Awesome ring! Great deal!  This ring definatley looked nicer than it did on the computer.It's gorgeous and there are no down-sides what so ever!I love it! <end>  pretty junk  One star is one too many for this piece of jewelry, but I had no choice, as I had to enter a rating. Personally, I believe it deserves 0 stars. When I received the ring in the mail I was pleasantly surprised, as the setting was beautiful and the stone very clear. But after wearing it only a few short hours, the stone came loose, unbeknownst to me, and as I later discovered, fell out. It is not an expensive piece by any means, so I was not too put out over it, but if you are considering purchasing this item, I would suggest passing this one up. <end>  Very pretty!  Beautiful ring, however be sure not to knock it on anything... after wearing it for long periods the stone gets loose. It hasn't fallen out yet, but you can tell it is thinking about it.Even if it does, though, I've definitely gotten my monies worth! <end>  loser  the stone fell out one day after owning this ring,it is very beautiful and i would have it set again, this time much better than was shipped,but i cannot find the stone.oh i guess i won't be shopping here anymore <end>  Pretty,but shoddy workmanship....  A good price for a pretty ring...but if you are intending for a "daily wearing" kind of ring, you may want to look further.The marcasite stones began to fall out after the first few months of wear..... <end>  4 star review  I loved the elegant design and it was just as ordered when I received it. The only thing I would have wished were different was a larger stone-and wouldn't have minded paying extra for that. I really liked the unique design. I love the jewelry selections at Amazon.com. <end>  Not happy  You get what you pay for here. I think it is prettier on the computer than in person. My son's girlfriend wore it two days and it started tarnishing. She was so happy with it when he first gave it to her, so I hate that it is not holding up. <end>  Simply Beautiful  This ring is just beautiful.Very nice quality and elegance for the price.I wear it every day and recieve many compliments,including "are you engaged"? I'm not,but that should tell you how nice the ring is..And it does feel nice to hear that little compliment.&lt;smiles> <end>  This is a pretty one  The medal is shiny and the stone is pretty and clear. It is a little bit darker than the picture shown, but not drastically. I like it a lot, it is lovely and the band isn't so wide its uncomfortable, its a nice snug fit. Thank you for this nice piece of Jewelry, I love rings and love collecting them <end>  Great product  Love this product. It is very beautiful and elgante. Looks like I spent more then I did. <end>  Beautiful!! Awesome price!  This ring is gorgeous!! The stone is actually a deeper purple than what the picture shows. The style is very unique & funky - but at the same time it's dainty - which I love. I'm planning on buying the Garnet version of this ring for my mom. Highly recommend Silver Insanity! <end>  Marcasite ring, simply lovely.  Great ring, quick delivery. Happy with purchase. Lovely design and happy to have it in amethyst purple, my favorite!

 B00023K2IU  Sterling Silver Marcasite Red Garnet Heart Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Cute for Teen Girl  This ring from Silver Insanity was shipped uber fast! It came in the condition as shown, although the garnet is a little more brown red than the stone pictured. So, of course, stone quality varies. It is sturdy and not chinzy feeling. I'd feel confident purchasing from them again, and my gift recipient will love it. <end>  Beatiful Ring  When I got this ring yesterday, I was so happy. The heart and the stone in it are just the right size (not too big or too small), and it looks much more expensive than it is.

 B00023K2J4  Italian 2mm Sterling Silver 22" Snake Chain Necklace ||	  Nice Chain - Exactly as Described  I liked this chain. It was exactly what I needed for the pendant I had. It is durable and comfortable.Exactly as desrcibed. This company ships EXTREMELY fast. Super, duper fast. I ordered it late one evening and had it to my house 2 days later. And this was not choosing an expedited shipping option, either! <end>  Good Vendor, Good Product  I have ordered from Silver Insanity several times and each product has been beautiful, including this chain. My favorite celtic earrings came from this vendor last year as well as my daughter's favorite earrings. They ship quickly. I had a product problem on one order and they quickly responded to my email within 24 hours and shipped a replacement the next day during this Christmas season, no questions asked! Very pleased! No fears ordering from them. <end>  great choice  Chains arrived within 2 days of ordering. I purchased 3 and all came in one tiny gift sack. I was fine with that but you might request separate bags if you need them to be separate gifts. These were going to be used with photo ball lockets that I purchased from a different vendor. They work perfectly with the lockets and are just the right size as far as diameter and length. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again. <end>  Just Beautiful!  Since I found Silver Insanity it is the ONLY jewelry company I will buy from. I have purchased celtic necklaces, rings, earrings, charms, and chains and the quality and price CANNOT be beat. I tell everyone I know about this company; STELLER deals and quality. I have never been disappointed, ever, when buying from this wonderful company. Seriously, I am brutal on jewelry but this quality jewerly has never broken...just EXCELLENT, and it arrives practically overnight. I am completely thrilled. <end>
 B00023K2JO  Sterling Silver Garnet Marcasite Ring size 9.5(Size 6,7,8,9) ||	  OMG! I ADORE THIS RING!!!!  It is SO MUCH PRETTIER in person!!!!! I literally cannot stop looking at it! On the female hand, it looks like something you would imagine a Balinese Princess wearing. Everyone comments on it. I'm so glad I picked it out! The pictures are cute but, Not even close to as pretty as the real ring.  ) <end>  good for the price  it is a very pretty ring...the picture definately was more appealing, but very pretty once its on a hand  )i suggest it be worn as a middle finger ring, as to it is quite large. <end>  Nice  Stones sturdy enough, not as "glamourous" as in photo, but good deal for money paid. nice everyday ring <end>  Glad I bought it  Like others said, it was delivered with surprising alacrity. I do think it looks like the picture, but it was a little larger than I imagined. No problem with that, though, as my husband thinks more is "more" where jewelry is concerned.I didn't think the garnets were too orange, but then, I prefer garnets to the so-much-more-precious rubies because rubies can tend to be pinkish.I wish I could have gotten it in a size 5, but other than that, I would definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is a very pretty and unique ring, with a seriously satisfying weight to it. I love it and would give it five stars if the garnets weren't more orange then red and if it didnt have a few nicks and scratches on the sides. Beautiful anyways. <end>  so beautiful!  This ring far exceeds my expectations - it's beautiful and eye-catching. I wear it everday! <end>
 B00023K2KS  Sterling Silver Red Garnet Wing Butterfly Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8) ||	  Excellent Quality  I ordered this ring for my daughter's birthday and I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The detailing is excellent and it is a very pretty, very classy looking ring. The tiny antennae add just the right touch, and the stones are a nice shade of red. I liked the ring so much that I am going to order one for myself. I think that if you like the picture, you will absolutely love this ring when you see it! >^..^&lt; <end>  it is cute  It is a very cute ring. I liked it a lot. I only think im not so satisfy its a little bit too raised. have to be carefull it catches on to your clothes when you are dressing. A little bit too girly, The colors are great. <end>  Perfect!  I heard a quote the other day that went..."and just when life seemed surely over, the caterpillar turned into a beautiful butterfly" I'm in the process of divorce right now. Its been really hard. And there have been times that "life seemed surly over" So when I heard that quote...I thought THAT'S ME! I am just in the process of turning into a butterfly! I decided I wanted something to remind me of that quote when things got tough... And this was it! I love it...its perfect!! I looked a lot of places, but I wear a size 4 and they are hard to find.

I would highly recommend them.  ) <end>  Excellent Quality  I ordered this ring for my daughter's birthday and I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.

 B00023K2XA  Sterling Silver X Weave Puzzle Ring Size 7.5(Size 5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  Silver Puzzle Ring  The ring was very beautiful and exactly as described. The only problem we have is my daughter took it apart out of curriosity. She has not been able to put it back together using the instructions provided on the web. We also noted the silver is very soft and bends easily. <end>  nice  do not let ring get undone, takes a while to put back together. Accidentallydropped it at work and it everyone attempted to put it back together, it took hours..... <end>  unique puzzle ring  I purchased this ring because when I was younger I owned one. The ring is exactly what I hoped it would be. It took me sometime to put it together the first time I took it off, but I finally figured it out with tips from an online video that helped me through. Now I can put it back together when needed. I wear this ring every day. It is simple and nice looking. <end>  puzzle ring  Love the ring. Very comfortable. Shipping turnaround was great. Only downside is be careful taking it off..takes forever to figure how to put it back together, unless you are looking for something to do.  ) <end>  Puzzle Directions  I love this ring-- I wore one for almost 4 years before losing it (so I'm here to get another!).For those of you who accidentally drop it, these instructions accurately illustrate how I put mine back together [...]There's a little trick though, the 2 pieces that form the X shape across the front only fit in one configuration, so if they don't fit together perfectly, drop the piece on the rightmost side and bring it back up to be on the left hand side of the piece you're still holding. This should rearrange the pieces so that they will twist together correctly.Once you get the hang of it you can put it together in seconds. <end>  Very pretty ring  This is a very cute ring!! I read the reviews on this ring before I bought it, and saw how difficult some said it was to fit back together after taking it appart, so I haven't done that yet. Although it looks VERY tempting, I will not be taking it apart, but it is VERY pretty to wear!! <end>  Nice Puzzle Ring  Ordering was easy. The order arrived promptly and was well packaged. I bought this for my daughter (in her 20's) because she loves puzzles. She was quite pleased with the ring. I would prefer that the assembly instructions be included with the purchase of the ring. Overall, a pleasant shopping experience. <end>
 B00023K30M  Sterling Silver Fancy Filigree CELTIC Cross Earrings ||	  Very pretty  These earrings are very pretty! They are shiny, not flat looking. They are slightly larger than I expected (1 1/2") but very nice. They look much more expensive than they are. My niece will love them! <end>  Great Looking Earrings!  I loved these earrings, they are my favorite pair of earrings that i own, the size is just perfect, and they look great with everything , even bluejeans! <end>  Perfect Gift  I had been looking forever for some good cross earrings for my mom. Most of the ones i saw were too tiny or too gaudy, but these ones were perfect! And they arrived on time, even during the crazy christmas season. Im soooo glad silver insanity had them at such a good price! <end>  Looks Nice, Feels Sturdy  Just came after shipping promptly. Really nice design and the earring itself feels sturdy (after lightly trying to bend). Only complaint is packaging. It came in one of those small drug pill zip bags (like in the movies) and then placed inside a velvet bag...not exactly the greatest packaging. <end>  See review for matching cross pendant, to be gifted w/these earrings!  These are very nice Celtic cross earrings; am looking forward to gifting them as a set with the matching cross! <end>  not to heavy and not to big  I am usto small Cross Earrings. Crosses is the only Earring U wear and The weight nor the size doesn't bother me. <end>
 B00023K3DY  Sterling Silver Amethyst and White CZ Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Exactly as pictured!  Ring is beautiful, of excellent quality, super price and was received in only several days. My second order from this company and will definately order again. <end>  Gorgeous!  Beautiful ring. Fast delivery- I am very satisfied with this product and the delivery. I love 'Silver Insanity'! <end>  The Color was a Little Disappointing  The ring is very sparkely, however the purple color is not NEARLY as deep and rich looking as the picture. It is very light, almost a lavender, and doesn't really look Amethyst at all. I don't believe this is the seller's fault - and was VERY happy with other items I ordered from them and the speed of delivery. <end>
 B00023K3FC  Heavy Sterling Silver Wire & Chain Mens Ring Size 11(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Great ring...  I like this ring very much, it is actually the first ring I have ever purchased for myself, and fits my appearance well(Im, kind of a rocker guy). The only negative things about the ring is that it can damage some things due to the deep ridges. Also, do not wear the ring if you are using a bar of soap, because it will literally dig chunks out of the soap, and get stuck in the ring. It is easy to wash out, but reaps hell on your soap supply, haha. However, I feel that this was a great purchase, and I actually feel "naked" when I take the ring off. It almost feels like it's meant to be on my hand at this point. Which I've only worn for a little over a month. Also, if your fingers are very close together, I would not reccomend this ring, I have boney more spaced out fingers. However, if you do not have a boney more thin spaced out fingered hand. You are most likely going to have sores on your surrounding fingers from the width of the ring, unless you put the ring on your thumb. I even had a sore in the webbing of my fingers. However, I like the ring so much I left it on and the sore went away....P.S. The ring also seems to protect my hand. If I make a fist or touch something with the outside of the hand. The ring always seems to make first contact. <end>  Loving Ring  I bought this product as a second ring to wear when I was dressed casually. After I recieved the ring it has become my number one choice to wear. It is comfortable and actually has a classy look to it.I wear this ring all the time and get many compliments on it. When I ordered this ring I never thought I would love it as much as I do. This ring was a great find. <end>  Nice Ring  I love this ring. I purchased it from Amazon about a year ago and I wear it everyday. I get many compliments about the ring. I would recommend this ring to anywho who is into silver. <end>  christmas  the ring is sturdy, and heavy, worth the price, came quickly, my husband loved it. he wears it all the time., <end>
 B00023K4EC  Sterling Silver Gray and Green Labradorite Hook Earrings ||	  Cute Earrings  They are well made and cute but too small for me. The labradorite stone in the earrings are specs. Good for children. Product is well made. <end>
 B00023K4YC  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Red Garnet Hook Earrings ||	  Great design, substandard stones  The stones, which are simulated garnet, are completely the wrong color -- a pale, golden brown instead of a deep, rich red. Otherwise, the silver Celtic knot design is lovely. <end>  Not as Nice as Image  The image really looks much better than the actual product. Stones are quite brownish, not red as one would expect of garnet. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this. <end>  crap  they ship really fast..which is nice, but ultimatly, this item reminds me too much of something that would come out of a 25 cent machine...it is a piece of crap and it looks a lot dinkier in real life then it does in the pictures, plus the stone is not "garnet" it more so resembles the color brown...like a turd. <end>  Great Company  My wife loves the jewelry. They were shipped and received quickly, and none of the standard online ordering fiascoes that I usually run into occurred. I'll be completing the set as time goes on. <end>  Pretty  Less red then shown, but still pretty. kind of a darkish brown, great for a fancy neutral color. <end>  garnet celtic earrings  I would wear these everyday, if i could. pretty, sturdy and celtic garnet dangle earrings. can't beat em <end>  Great Jewelry  Beautiful Earrings. A big Christmas Hit. Thanks for fast delivery and great product. I would buy from this seller again.. Thanks. <end>  Perfect quality for the price  These earrings are quite nice. Yes they do look brown up to the light, but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow. They can be worn to accent an elegant look, or add style to a "Friday" casual look. They may not be heirloom quality, but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category. <end>  Beautiful.  As always, Silver Insanity matches gorgeous jewelry with good prices. The garnets were the perfect deep red that i love. These earings were perfect and lighter than expected, I also got the blue topaz version and loved it as well. With their quick shipping on top of everything else, Silver Insanity is my favorite seller. <end>  Excellent product.  Beautiful. Good quality. Fast shippping. Great experience. Would do business again with this vendor. Packed well for shipment. just as advertised. <end>  For my mother for Christmas  I ordered these for my mother for Christmas. she loved them and they looked very nice for the price. They hold up well and fit great on her <end>  Celtic Knot Earrings  I love earrings and I always try to find interesting patterns. Well, I came across these lovely Celtic Knot earrings. These earrings are a little smaller and more light weight then most of my other pairs, which allows me to ware these earrings for a couple of days without them bothering me. I am really pleased with this pair. <end>  Lovely  These are a gift for someone who likes Celtic design and was born in January. They were a perfect pick for a gift. When I got them in the mail, I was quite pleased with the quality. <end>  Celtic Amethyst earrings  I am completely satisfied in all respects of the earrings I purchased recently for my daughters birthday. The quality and ease of ordering and the timely delivery of this product was very good. My daughter is very happy with the earrings. <end>  Very pretty, good-sized earings  I bought these for myself while buying some other jewelry from Silver Insanity for gifts. These are quite nice, but once I saw theSterling Silver Teardrop Red GARNET Marcasite Earringsthat I bought for someone else, I wish I had bought myself a pair of those instead of these! Still these are nice. Yes, the garnet has a brown tone, but the only thing I'd fault on these earrings is that the bezel holding the garnet is kind of thick, and I think it would look better if the front edge of the bezel was attached to the rest of the silver knot work, instead of attached at the back of the bezel, to reduce some of the "thick" look of the bezel. Still, for about $15, that's a minor quibble. <end>  poor service  It took over a month to get my product from this company.I will not order from them again. When I did get the ear rings, they were much smaller than they seemed in the picture. It would be nice to have some sort of picture scale to see the size of the item being purchased. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot NOT so Red Garnet Earrings  I had received the earrings I purchased on Amazon and they were supposed to be RED garnets. But their color is far closer to Amber than red (as was pictured) and I was very disappointed. I wrote my problem to Amazon and to date have had no response. I had asked back then to either send replacement pair sent (at NO additional shipping charges to ME) that someone actually CHECKS the color or I would send these back for a full refund. The style is very cute - I even like the accompanying necklace and ring designs - HOWEVER....I then wrote to 6 different departments at Amazon asking for help with an exchange --- to this day, WEEKS later, None of the departments has responded. The holidays are now passed - I have a gift I could not give.Disappointed. <end>  Awesome earrings  I love these earrings. They are a great length. The garnet is a nice shade and neutral enough to go with most colors. Also, the knot work is very pretty. These can be worn dressy or casual. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Earrings  The earrings are beautiful. I bought them for my daughter. She wears them with all outfits, causal or dressy. They were a great buy. <end>  Good quality  These earrings have a heavy feel (not too heavy) and are very beautiful. <end>  Beautiful workmanship  This is the second item I have ordered from this company, and I am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money. I would recommend them to anyone. <end>  Beautiful earrings  I purchased the light blue and dark red versions of these earrings. I just love them. I can wear them to work in professional attire, or with jeans on the weekend. I am a 40-something professional, atheletic grandmother. I want to look stylish but not faddish. These earrings are just the style that help me surprise people when they find out I am a "Nana!" <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Red Garnet Hook Earrings  Fast and easy ordering, Received frequent order status updates. Received order as expected (fast). I love these earrings. I have worn at least one day a week since I received <end>  Part of an Anniversary Present  On time.Quality as good as hoped for...if not better.The Lady in my life was impressed.Economic.What more do you want ?Ace! <end>
 B00023K50U  Wide Flower Design Embossed Sterling Silver Cuff Bracelet ||	  Completely gorgeous  I recieved this for Valentines day. I am very, very happy with it. It's gorgous. The picture doesn't do it justice. It's not heavy, they're not kidding. It's easy to forget you're wearing it. It came in a very pretty dark red sheer bag. I'll wear this forever. Worth every penny. <end>  Beautiful and sturdy.  Beautiful bracelet, a piece of art! I gave it to my daughter for her sweet 16 and she was very happy with it (the theme was Arabesque so even the design was appropriate). She received so many compliments on it and it dresses up even a casual long sleeve t-shirt and jeans. <end>  Very good choice  That's a very beautiful bracelet, exactly how you can see it in the image. It worth all the money. I bought it for my sister and she was very excited and happy with it. <end>  Great detail  Overall, beautiful cuff bracelet. Bought it for my sister as a gift. The only drawback is the thickness of the bracelet. It was very detailed in the design, but lacking in durability due to thinness. <end>
 B00023K51Y  Gothic Eye Sterling Silver Twisted Eyeball Ring Size 4.5(Sizes 4.5,5,5.5,6,7,8,9,9.5,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  Ol' blue eyes  Looks fantabulous. The eye itself is a lot more detailed than i thought it'd be. &lt;3 <end>  EyeBall Ring  I love my ring, and it came pretty fast, was a really good price. But the glue that holds the eye into the ring did not hold that good. I had to re-glue the eye back into the ring, but that was not that much of a big deal. Still like the ring, would buy from seller again !! <end>  The eye follows you!!! It's too cool!  Product as represented - - quite a conversation piece. It will be great for Halloween. <end>  a dream come true  I had always wanted a ring like this. Some say it's beautiful, others creepy. But I love it..it's a keeper <end>
 B00023K5VO  Sterling Silver Winged Heart on Black Onyx Ball Pendant ||	  FUNKY but GREAT pendant!  The onyx in this pendant is nice, deep, dark black with a light shine and the bead cap is great with the winged design! Good size (not too big or too small) and even nicer than described. Reasonable pricing (including getting a nice affordable chain at checkout) makes this a great buy! <end>
 B00023K5X2  Sterling Silver Faceted GARNET and AMETHYST Pendant ||	  LOVELY pendant and EXCELLENT quality-must see!  This seller has a number of fabulous pendants and I have purchased quite a few, never being disappointed. The QUALITY is there, the price is FAIR and their service is GREAT. Sterling and nice stones can be hard to find in good quality at a nice price and this is one of those rare times that it all comes together. ANYTHING that you buy from this seller is likely to be WONDERFUL. <end>  Nice for the Price  Not a bad deal for the price. Pay close attention to the size when you order, it is not that large and if you buy earings that are larger they may overshadow it. I think it looks nice and the garnet is a nice deep red. <end>
 B00023K6C2  Sterling Silver Etched Classy Hexagon Locket Pendant ||	  Very Pleased  Wow, for the price, you can't beat this locket. It is small but not too small to put the kids pictures in. Very pleased with this purchase. <end>
 B00023K6TA  Sterling Silver Ivy Leaf Vine Branch Marcasite Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Careful With This One!  I love this ring, it is just as pictured and looks very elegant. The only caveat I have is that the shape and structure lend the ring to easy bends--I have already broken a couple soldered points. Also, I snag it on lots of things--clothes mainly--so I end up shelving the thing more than wearing it. But I am pretty rough on my hands, so if you aren't, this is a great ring for you. <end>  Nearly covers your whole finger! Nice and lean!  Silver Insanity has the best accessories!!! I saw the image of the ring on Amazon and immediately fell in love. I love rings that covers your proximal phalanx (the bone in your finger closest to your hand). When I received the ring, (earlier than counted upon), I was a little disappointed to see how little it looked and how dainty but that was before I tried it on. I was expecting the ring to be bulky and glad it wasn't. The fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx to the rings slimness. I recommend using the ring size chart b/c I had thought I'd be a 6; turns out, I'm a 7. What was misleading, though, is the picture. The leaves are shown bright, but it looks noticably darker (inside the outer rimming of the leaf, to where the gems are) when you have it in your hands. My fingers are long and slender. The ring didn't twist or turn about, but it didn't cover my proximal phalanx completely. I'll measure... from the end of the bottom leave to the end of the top, it's about 3.3cm. My middle proximal phalanx (the bone in your middle finger closest to your hand) is about 3.8cm. And if you should run your fingers through your hair, the leaves will not get entangled! Nice!You can wear the damn ring everywhere!!! I love it! <end>  Great product!  I love this ring. It is fun and it looks nice. I get compliments about it every time I wear it. <end>  Unique  Ring was nice, and unique. The points do snag on things though. And one of the "diamond" chips fell out but you can't really tell. <end>  Classy  Love the looks of this piece. Very classy and elegant, yet does not preak the bank. <end>  my favorite ring  The pictures don't do this ring any justice. It's a very pretty, unique ring. <end>  great ring!  I love this ring! I originally found it when I was reordering another vine ring from silver insanity. My boyfriend's mom gave me the vines and leaves ring which I also love, and I wore it at work too much (I'm a waitress) and a piece broke off. I went to amazon to order a replacement and found this ring. I ended up ordering both rings. I love this one because I can wear it at work and it has only caught on things a few times, and it was pretty easy to bend it right back into shape. The price was unbeatable and the quality of the ring was better than I expected. I have had so many complements on it, that I am going to order the matching earings!!! <end>  love the ring, but....  I love this ring, I really do. It's absolutely gorgeous. The only problem is that so far i have already lost three of the stones it in. It still looks ok, but losing those stones definately dissapointed me. I still wear it almost every day though. <end>  Worth it!  perfect pricing for this ring! Pretty! delivered quickly & in great condition! <end>

 B00023K7EY  Sterling Silver Ivy Leaf Vine Branch Marcasite Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Careful With This One!  I love this ring, it is just as pictured and looks very elegant. The only caveat I have is that the shape and structure lend the ring to easy bends--I have already broken a couple soldered points. Also, I snag it on lots of things--clothes mainly--so I end up shelving the thing more than wearing it. But I am pretty rough on my hands, so if you aren't, this is a great ring for you. <end>  Nearly covers your whole finger! Nice and lean!  Silver Insanity has the best accessories!!! I saw the image of the ring on Amazon and immediately fell in love. I love rings that covers your proximal phalanx (the bone in your finger closest to your hand). When I received the ring, (earlier than counted upon), I was a little disappointed to see how little it looked and how dainty but that was before I tried it on. I was expecting the ring to be bulky and glad it wasn't. The fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx to the rings slimness.

 B00023K7HQ  Sterling Silver Green Celtic Knot Claddagh Ring Size 7(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  So Disappointed  I had this ring for years and lost it a few months ago, so I was very excited when I found it here online and at such a great price. It came very quickly and I had no problems receiving the order but the ring itself was so disappointing. It looks nothing like the product pictured! It's a very shiny silver. Nothing like the beautiful antiqued look in the picture or how my old ring used to look. Its also very cheap looking. Like it came from a quarter machine in an arcade. DON'T ORDER IT. it looks nothing like the ring in the picture. I am so bummed. I hope I get my money back. <end>  Quarter Machine Rings  I concur with the other 1 star review. The ring is cheap and looks nothing like the picture. It doesn't have an antiqued finish as shown. It looks like something you'd get out of a quarter machine at a grocery store.If you want to impress your lady, look elsewhere. <end>  very pretty  A very nice sturdy ring. i bought this ring when i lost my claddagh. its strong and looks very nice on the hand. would make a great gift for any lady <end>  Good ring  It is a very shiny silver, but I think it looks lovely, not cheap. It's definitely sterling silver - just as sturdy as another sterling silver ring of mine - and the craftsmanship is very beautiful. The 'crown' looks a little cheesy, as it's sitting atop the heart without touching it at all, but otherwise it is a very nice, simple kind of ring with a bit of a Celtic flair.  3It doesn't look like the tarnished antique you see in the picture except in design, though. Just as a warning~ <end>  Awesome ring  I got this ring shortly before the last Harry Potter book was released, in what...2007? I've worn it every single day since then, and it hasn't broken or turned my finger green or anything else like that. It actually looks better than the picture, which looks kind of like cheap costume jewelry. The little green "gem" (whatever it is) is actually pretty dark, since no light gets behind the ring. I'd highly recommend this ring to anyone. I'd consider getting other one for my other hand, even! <end>
 B00023K7IK  Lady in the Moon Sterling Silver Pendant with Genuine Blue Lapis Healing Crystal ||	  Beautiful piece  This was more than a picture could do it justice. Very true blue color with lots of detail. <end>  Mystical with style  This is a product that I am glad I followed through to order. The whole design appealed to me with the moon, fairy and lapis in such a nice faceted shape. Those who notice make nice comments about it and find it tasteful also. No flaws in mine just perfect. <end>  beautiful  This was for my daughter and she loves it.I thought it was beautiful,shipped fast and was packed very good. very satisfied. <end>  Love it!!  First impression of it was great. i got it really fast in the mail. The crystal is very beautiful. there are a few hints of gold in the crystal that i wasn't expecting but it makes it look amazing! The only thing i would complain about is some glue thats on the top part of the crystal where it connects to the metal. but i can live with that, its not too noticeable. and it seems like it is really secure. i got the 16 in. black silk cord chain necklace to go with it, and it is amazing! <end>
 B00023K7R6  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot DRAGON Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13) ||	  ring  I got the ring very quickly and I love it....it is even better then what I was expecting thanks <end>  Review ring size chart..  Unless you are completely positive of your ring size.. I would review the sizing chart. My husband wanted this for a pinky ring and after looking over the old one he had we went with a sz. 5.. It was of course too small.. but fit my 7 year old daughter-if that helpps anyone. We were definately happy with the quality and this item was quickly delivered to us. We're ordering a bigger size  ) <end>  Celtic dragon ring  I have had this ring for a few years now and I love it. I was looking for something to acknowledge my Irish heritage and satisfy my inner fantasy geek, this ring does it! The band gets a bit thin on the underside but it's held it's shape well and makes it very comfortable to wear.I've received several compliments on it over the years, not that I'm looking for them but it speaks to the cool factor of the ring.My ring size has shrunk, so I'm glad to see the ring is still available! <end>  Wonderful new ring  I only shop on line when buying presents or books. This is a valentines day prez for my boyfriend. He loves rings and necklaces. He loves ninjas, dragons, cars and legos. Shopping for him is easy. This came in a nifty little pouch that made wrapping a heck of alot easier. I had no problems with shipment and again I would buy from this seller again. <end>  I love this ring.  I love this ring. It is very comfortable and is still very attractive after i have been wearing it for a year. Great product. <end>  Love the ring  This is a very nice, detailed ring and I am very happy with it. I love the dragon and the knot design on the side adds to the ring's appeal. For sizing, keep in mind that it is a wider ring and you may have to go up. I'm in between a six and a seven, and the size seven fits perfectly. <end>  Dragon Lover  Ordered this ring as a gift after reading the other reviews. Received the ring very quickly, and when I opened it - I thought it can't be the same ring. VERY disappointed with the details. I couldn't tell what the dragon was. I regret buying it. <end>  Awesome~!  This ring rocks~! It's the only one that I have found that is truely Celtic/Viking looking and not a "regular" dragon with Celtic knots around it.I have taken it off ONLY to do the dishes~! <end>  Celtic Dragon Ring  Just as pictured with nice detail. This ring is sturdy and wears extremely well. I wear this everyday...and quite proudly, I might add ) <end>  Unique  I really like the ring. It is a good medium sized ring. I like how the dragon isn't in the form of a typical dragon. It's unique and I plan on wearing it often. It arrived before its estimated date of arrival and that is always nice. <end>  Best ring ever  I've had this ring for at least seven years. I've worn it more than any other piece of jewelry I've ever owned. I work with my hands in harsh conditions and it has held up amazingly. I get lots of compliments on it, AND it's comfortable to wear non-stop. Moisture doesn't accumulate under it (I have to wash my hands a lot). It's not perfectly round anymore, and I'm not sure when that happened, but I think I must have crushed it in something because it has not lost its shape any more than it already has, and it's not malleable using just hand strength. The actual design is like it appears in the picture. Durable and comfortable!! Great product. <end>
 B00023K80M  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Puzzle Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Present for Daughter  I bought this as a present for my daughter. I was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring. (If anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together, check wikipedia. I believe there is even a video.) I highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver, symbolism, and something just a little bit different. <end>  Nice ring  Nice ring, fast delivery. I still need to check it out, because my daughter says it doesn't completely "break down" the way my old puzzle ring did. <end>  if only i could put it back together!  I got this ring for my girlfriend for her birthday. We both loved it, it is really quite beautiful. Yet we still can't put it back together. It has been apart for about two months now, it's really disappointing. If you're amazing at putting things together, than you'll like it. If you're not, you'll probably still like it, but you might wan to leave it together. <end>  Rings were beautiful...the puzzle not so...  I bought two of the claddagh puzzle rings for me and my boyfriend for christmas. I was so excited that I recieved them by Christmas. The rings looked as I expected them too and I was thrilled to have matching rings for my boyfriend and I. However I was very very dissapointed when my puzzle ring fell apart and ther was no directions to put it back together. It fell apart the first night I got it before I had the chance to give my boyfriend his, which of course again very dissapointing seeing as I bought it as christmas presents. I tried for several hours that night to get it back together and so did other family members but no luck. We even got instructions with diagrams and watched a movie of it but it still wouldn't go back together. Luckily my boyfriends hasn't fell apart yet nor has he taken it apart after hearing my horor story of it. I had to buy a new ring from them just to have our matching rings because we are getting our pictures taken together. Hopefully it will arive soon and then when it does I am wrapping something around it to get it to stay together before I can get it welded. But its pretty dissapointing I have to do this seeing as its suppose to be a puzzle ring. All in all though they are pretty beautiful rings just be careful with them and don't take them apart unless you have plenty of time trying to figure out how to put them back together or you plan on spending another 20 plus shipping for a new ring. By the way you can't send the ring back for a refund unless it is assembled so beware of that too. The company itself gets a good rating from me though. <end>  Wow  I got a lot of shipping alerts and was confused as to when it would arrive, but i got it now and I couldn't be more pleased!!! gorgeous! I can't wait to take it apart and put it back together again!! Perfect for puzzle lovers! <end>  gripkid  I really love this ring! I mainly got it because they showed it on an episode of the Buffy the vampire slayer for a big fan one of these rings are a must! I haven't ventured to take it apart...YET and to be honest by the looks of these reviews it'll be a long time before i do *give me two-three days* haha BUT i did find some instructions from the website silver sanity that sells these the the website that they put on the reciept is kinda funky and i had to google it just to get to the right page but i'll post it on here seeing as no one else has---How to assemble a four link puzzle ring, step by step.Puzzles rings are a most intriguing piece of jewelry, with an interesting lore attached to them. In some areas of Turkey, they are the most common wedding band worn. Originally, they were intended to serve as a sort of motivator to keep married people faithful to one another. The theory was, if a spouse endeavored to commit adultery, they would first have to remove their wedding band, hiding their marital status from the potential fling. Since the rings are made up of interlocking bands, forming a pattern that requires knowledge to duplicate, once they are removed from the finger they fall apart quite easily...thus incriminating the guilty party.Today, these rings are worn mostly because of their beauty, not to mention the fact that they are excellent conversation pieces. They are a popular souvenier among tourists in the Middle East, especially Turkey. Many military personnel return from a tour of duty owning one or more of these rings, however, in time, the solution is forgotten!The following is a step by step solution for a thin band, four link puzzle ring.1. You will notice that the four bands are similar, but upon closer inspection there are slight differences. Two of the links have a simple peak to them, and the other two links have a dip and a peak. Look carefully to identify each link. At this time, single out the link that has a simple peak, with 4 etches carved into it. (The etches may be faint, compare the two simple peak links and choose the one with more grooves)2. Once you have found the simple peaked link with four grooves, hold that link only, letting the other links dangle. Turn the ring so that the top of the peak is pointing away from you. There should be two links dangling from the link you are holding, with the fourth link dangling from those two links.3. While still holding the four grooved link, take the other simple peaked link, which should be the one dangling from the bottom, and bring it up to meet with the one you are holding. You should now be holding the two links together, the bands of the links together, and the points of the peaks pointing outwards, opposite of each other (It should look like a diamond)4. Continue holding the links together with your thumb and pointer finger (you will need your other fingers for the next part).5. You will notice that you now have the two 'dip and peak' links dangling from the two links you are holding. Select the link on the right---this is trial and error, sometimes the correct link will be on the right already, and sometimes you may have to pass the wrong link over the top of the ring in order to place the correct link in the proper position. The two dangling links are very hard to tell apart, so you will discover which is the correct one for the next step by following these instructions  6. After grabbing the dangling link on the right, turn the link so that the peaks and dips face you. Looking at the link, notice the dips and peaks. You want the link that has peaks that point like arrows to the LEFT, then the right. (The other link has peaks that point like arrows to the RIGHT, then left )7. When you have found the correct link for the next step, hold it taut against the two simple peak bands you have been holding between your thumb and forefinger. The band of those two links should now be resting against the LEFT pointing peak of the selected link, and you should adjust your hands so that you are holding that link on your pinky, taut.8. With your free hand, grab the last remaining link. Turn the link so that the peaks and dips face the top of the ring (you should be holding the ring upright the entire time) Bring the remaining link towards the right, and overlap it with the link you're holding on your pinky. The easiest way to do this is to imagine you are trying to put the other link on your pinky with the one that's already there. If this is done correctly, you will still be holding the two simple peak links between your thumb and forefinger, and they will form a diamond shape. You will also be holding the other two links on your pinky, they should form a figure eight, with the other two bands passing through the center.9. At this point, I usually change the position of my hands. Now ,hold the figure eight together with your thumb and middle finger, trying not to disrupt the other ones too much! Try to maintain the diamond shape in some way, hold it however you are comfortable, in a way that will enable you to continue with these instructions.10. Select the link on the top, closest to you. (part of the diamond) Spin the link around so that the peak fits through the figure eight---also, make sure that once the peak is inside the figure eight it also passes through the band of the other part of the 'diamond' . When the link has been spun, and passed through the figure eight and the band of the remaining link, fold it downwards, so that it is flush with the two links that form a figure eight.11. Well, you made it to the last remaining link...congratulations!All you have to do now is carefully spin the last link so the peak fits between the peaks and gaps of the already mostly assembled ring (just spin it, no need to do anything fancy! ) Once the last remaining link has been passed through the ring, fold it down to lay flush with the rest of the links.12. Enjoy your puzzle ring!Solving your puzzle ring may have seemed difficult and awkward this time, but with practice it's actually quite simple. If you don't feel confident that you would be able to repeat this feat, I suggest taking the ring to a reputable jeweler to be soldered together! <end>  Confusing but not too bad`  I absolutely love the look of the ring! My friend took it apart, and I worked on it non-stop for almost a day before I looked up directions on-line. Once I foudn a couple sets, I compared them and it wasn't too bad to put back together.Again, I think the ring is gorgeous. <end>  Comes with Warnings!!!  this ring, i lovedwhen i got it..even betterbut i was so curiouse as to..if i could take it apart and put it back together. not even a week and i folled around with it, bad idea. it fell apart.i still cant get it together and been messing with it any chance i could get. the instructions it comes with isnt the best either. its all words and no images. kinda confusing. so do take apart but i warn you, you better be patient and very talented to get it together <end>  Tarnish Crap!  I ordered this ring and wore it a few times and it got all tarnished! So it is not Stainless Steel, and it wasnt worth sending it back! dont waste your money!!! <end>  gorgeous  i love puzzle rings. in england it's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazon <end>  It's a puzzler!  I do like this puzzle ring, even though I have not ventured to take it apart and reassemble it again. On my receipt, I saw an e-mail address for instructions on how to solve it, but the address didn't work. However, there are instructions at another site ([...]) for their claddagh puzzle rings that may be helpful if you can't solve it.All in all, a neat looking ring, but take it apart at your own risk!  ) <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Puzzle Band Ring Size  love this ring it is still in good condition and NOPE I never took it apart. I wanted to so bad but read on line it was very hard to get it back together. I had a lot of compliments on this one <end>  Great Ring! Challenging and Fun!  My boyfriend bought me this ring. I love it! A claddagh ring and a puzzle ring in one!! Great idea!It was tricky to put back together the first couple times, but I love a challenge (otherwise what's the point of a puzzle ring??) and now that I now how to do it I can put it back together in about a minute. Just don't force it - as many others have mentioned the individual rings are thin and bend easily. No force it necessary to get it back together, just a bit of finagling.I did find that it was a bit tarnished when I first took it apart but some baking soda and water polished it up nicely. It could have gotten five stars had it not been tarnished upon arrival. Boyfriend, however, does get five stars. <end>  bad idea.  I had this maybe two weeks before it broke. Junk. Thin week bands make for bad puzzle pieces. This thing will not stand up to daily wear for long. <end>  Love the ring!  I love my ring, although I have not tried to take it apart. I have always wanted a Claddagh ring and bought this for me for my birthday. I received it fast and it is beautiful. I have read the other reviews on how hard it is to take it apart or put it back together. I do not even want to try, I love it just the way it is! This is the second ring that I have ordered from Amazon.com and would recommend them to anyone that loves puzzle rings or Celtic jewelry! <end>  Fantastic  This is the most unique claddagh I've seen yet, a claddagh AND a puzzle ring. Great quality, quick shipping. I was very pleased. <end>  Awful  I ordered this ring for my daughter. It arrived severely tarnished. Because it was an inexpensive ring it didn't make sense to pay for shipping to send it back. We took the ring apart and used some silver polish on it. The tarnish came off but but so did silver coating also the ring is impossible to put back together. The instructions aren't for this ring in particular and aren't very clear. Not to mention how flimsy the metal is. Not a good buy. <end>  Other Opinion  I have read the other reviews about the weak metal, and the fact that people can't put the ring back together. My husband bought this ring for me and I could not even take it apart. Puzzle rings in general are thinner so they break and bend easily if your not careful. My husband bought it a lil too small, so I had it resized... the jeweler didn't want to until I said that I didn't care about the fact that it would never come apart. I love it and it is a great sign of love between us. <end>  An enjoyable piece  While not an exceptional ring, this is still an enjoyable piece for fans of either the Claddagh or puzzle rings in general.Both my wife and I wear a Claddagh for our wedding rings. The puzzle rings came this afternoon and while my wife hasn't dismantled hers just yet I simply couldn't wait. This, like most puzzle rings, is tricky and requires a certain amount of dexterity and patience. After playing with it for a couple of horus I succumbed and found a very useful video tutorial by Googling '4BDS Puzzle Ring Solution Video'While I feel like I cheated some; the solution, once you've learned it, comes pretty readily to mind.The only reason I held back on 5 stars is the metal bands have become somewhat warped in my frustrated gropings! The inside of the bands will appear damaged and tarnished - I imagine this ring may be silver plated. From other reviewers' mention of allergic reactions, don't be fooled in thinking this is a sterling silver ring. <end>  Claddagh Puzzle Ring  Nice ring for price. We have found the silver to be a little soft. Bends easily. The instructions on the Internet are not ring specific for this item, therefore we are afraid to even take it apart. Needs better instructions written for specific rings. <end>  Puzzle Ring Plus  This ring is awesome. It is well made and amazing how it fits together. My only complaint is that the idea of a puzzle ring is misleading. I thought that all four bands would come totally apart from each other. I was going to keep two rings for myself and give two rings to another person as a representation that we are two pieces, but when we are together we are whole. The problem is the rings are all inter-looped, so in order to do this I am going to have to cut them and solder them together. The other thing was, which is good for someone who doesn't want to worry about it falling apart....is that once I clipped the white band that was holding it together, it didn't fall all apart. I was expecting it to just fall to pieces. I literally had to struggle and pull at it to get it to come apart....in fact I lost patience in getting it apart and had to give it to someone else to pull apart. So as long as you aren't trying to use it like I wanted to, this ring is perfect for you. It doesn't come apart easily and they are all looped together so you can't lose any of the pieces. <end>  Be careful about sizing  This was given to me as a gift, and the person who gave it to me based the sizing on the sizing of the rest of the rings I wear. However, whatwe discovered is that these rings are a bit bulky (of course, that's what puzzle rings are about!), so mine is a bit too tight. I think Silver Insanity's website has instructions on sizing, but just in case that isn't an option I recommend goinga size larger. <end>  waste of money  I bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart. The bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled. Poor quality, I am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring, or the fragile nature of the metal. I wish I had my 25 bucks back. <end>  Awful ring..  Well atleast the package came quickly, cause the ring is horrible. I took it apart to see if I could put it back together, and what do I see, but the entire inside of the ring is tarnished. I used jewelery polish, and still couldn't get the ring to a silver look. Oh, and one of the bands snapped when I tried to put it back together for the first time. I contacted the seller, and am trying to get a refund. Hopefully their service is better than their products. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is my fave ring of all time. It comes with a string around it so it won't fall a part when you take it out of the box. Although, mine has to never come apart. It doesn't just fall apart like some of the looser knots do. I got a size 9 & it is a heavy ring so if you don't like heavy rings this one might not be for you.I love this ring & the company has a video you can watch & learn to how to put it, & other puzzle rings, back together. The indviual bands are thin & can bend so you have to be nice it, but it is well worth the money. <end>  It's terrible  I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring. We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless. <end>  pretty, but flimsy ring with useless assembly instructions  The ring is very pretty, but the instructions to reassemble the ring are useless and you have to be very careful with the individual rings as they are very thin metal. <end>  a puzzler!  I loved this ring the moment I saw it, and begged my boyfriend to buy it for me for christmas.When I got it, I immediatly put it on. I thought "Well, I wonder how it comes apart."BIG MISTAKE!It still hasn't been put back together, after two months, and every person in my family tried. I suggest that it come with instructions. (yes, even though this defeats the purpose) <end>  Watch out for sensitive skin  I purchased this ring for my girlfriend for Christmas after she mentioned having a claddagh ring before that broke. I think it is a really cool design and thought she'd enjoy the fact that it is a puzzle ring. And while she was really excited and likes the ring a lot she can not wear it for long periods of time due to the fact that it causes her to get blisters on her finger due to something in the metal. After later doing research on this I learned that there is a sizable number of people allergic to nickel which I suspect is present in this ring. <end>  Looks nice  I haven't disassembled it yet for fear of not being able to put it back together again. Doesn't look too hard, but judging by other reviewers' experiences, I decided not to try my luck. It looks quite nice the way it is.Once again, Silver Insanity did an excellent job. Amazon had mistakenly placed two orders, but Silver Insanity noticed it and called my attention to the fact. <end>  HELLLPPPPPP  Someone, please help me!!I have tried all the online help videos and guides and such, and I still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again! PLEASE HELP! <end>  Present for Daughter  I bought this as a present for my daughter. I was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring. (If anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together, check wikipedia. I believe there is even a video.) I highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver, symbolism, and something just a little bit different. <end>  Nice ring  Nice ring, fast delivery. I still need to check it out, because my daughter says it doesn't completely "break down" the way my old puzzle ring did. <end>  if only i could put it back together!  I got this ring for my girlfriend for her birthday. We both loved it, it is really quite beautiful. Yet we still can't put it back together. It has been apart for about two months now, it's really disappointing. If you're amazing at putting things together, than you'll like it. If you're not, you'll probably still like it, but you might wan to leave it together. <end>  Rings were beautiful...the puzzle not so...  I bought two of the claddagh puzzle rings for me and my boyfriend for christmas. I was so excited that I recieved them by Christmas. The rings looked as I expected them too and I was thrilled to have matching rings for my boyfriend and I. However I was very very dissapointed when my puzzle ring fell apart and ther was no directions to put it back together. It fell apart the first night I got it before I had the chance to give my boyfriend his, which of course again very dissapointing seeing as I bought it as christmas presents. I tried for several hours that night to get it back together and so did other family members but no luck. We even got instructions with diagrams and watched a movie of it but it still wouldn't go back together. Luckily my boyfriends hasn't fell apart yet nor has he taken it apart after hearing my horor story of it. I had to buy a new ring from them just to have our matching rings because we are getting our pictures taken together. Hopefully it will arive soon and then when it does I am wrapping something around it to get it to stay together before I can get it welded. But its pretty dissapointing I have to do this seeing as its suppose to be a puzzle ring. All in all though they are pretty beautiful rings just be careful with them and don't take them apart unless you have plenty of time trying to figure out how to put them back together or you plan on spending another 20 plus shipping for a new ring. By the way you can't send the ring back for a refund unless it is assembled so beware of that too. The company itself gets a good rating from me though. <end>  Wow  I got a lot of shipping alerts and was confused as to when it would arrive, but i got it now and I couldn't be more pleased!!! gorgeous! I can't wait to take it apart and put it back together again!! Perfect for puzzle lovers! <end>  gripkid  I really love this ring! I mainly got it because they showed it on an episode of the Buffy the vampire slayer for a big fan one of these rings are a must! I haven't ventured to take it apart...YET and to be honest by the looks of these reviews it'll be a long time before i do *give me two-three days* haha BUT i did find some instructions from the website silver sanity that sells these the the website that they put on the reciept is kinda funky and i had to google it just to get to the right page but i'll post it on here seeing as no one else has---How to assemble a four link puzzle ring, step by step.Puzzles rings are a most intriguing piece of jewelry, with an interesting lore attached to them. In some areas of Turkey, they are the most common wedding band worn. Originally, they were intended to serve as a sort of motivator to keep married people faithful to one another. The theory was, if a spouse endeavored to commit adultery, they would first have to remove their wedding band, hiding their marital status from the potential fling. Since the rings are made up of interlocking bands, forming a pattern that requires knowledge to duplicate, once they are removed from the finger they fall apart quite easily...thus incriminating the guilty party.Today, these rings are worn mostly because of their beauty, not to mention the fact that they are excellent conversation pieces. They are a popular souvenier among tourists in the Middle East, especially Turkey. Many military personnel return from a tour of duty owning one or more of these rings, however, in time, the solution is forgotten!The following is a step by step solution for a thin band, four link puzzle ring.1. You will notice that the four bands are similar, but upon closer inspection there are slight differences. Two of the links have a simple peak to them, and the other two links have a dip and a peak. Look carefully to identify each link. At this time, single out the link that has a simple peak, with 4 etches carved into it. (The etches may be faint, compare the two simple peak links and choose the one with more grooves)2. Once you have found the simple peaked link with four grooves, hold that link only, letting the other links dangle. Turn the ring so that the top of the peak is pointing away from you. There should be two links dangling from the link you are holding, with the fourth link dangling from those two links.3. While still holding the four grooved link, take the other simple peaked link, which should be the one dangling from the bottom, and bring it up to meet with the one you are holding. You should now be holding the two links together, the bands of the links together, and the points of the peaks pointing outwards, opposite of each other (It should look like a diamond)4. Continue holding the links together with your thumb and pointer finger (you will need your other fingers for the next part).5. You will notice that you now have the two 'dip and peak' links dangling from the two links you are holding. Select the link on the right---this is trial and error, sometimes the correct link will be on the right already, and sometimes you may have to pass the wrong link over the top of the ring in order to place the correct link in the proper position. The two dangling links are very hard to tell apart, so you will discover which is the correct one for the next step by following these instructions  6. After grabbing the dangling link on the right, turn the link so that the peaks and dips face you. Looking at the link, notice the dips and peaks. You want the link that has peaks that point like arrows to the LEFT, then the right. (The other link has peaks that point like arrows to the RIGHT, then left )7. When you have found the correct link for the next step, hold it taut against the two simple peak bands you have been holding between your thumb and forefinger. The band of those two links should now be resting against the LEFT pointing peak of the selected link, and you should adjust your hands so that you are holding that link on your pinky, taut.8. With your free hand, grab the last remaining link. Turn the link so that the peaks and dips face the top of the ring (you should be holding the ring upright the entire time) Bring the remaining link towards the right, and overlap it with the link you're holding on your pinky. The easiest way to do this is to imagine you are trying to put the other link on your pinky with the one that's already there. If this is done correctly, you will still be holding the two simple peak links between your thumb and forefinger, and they will form a diamond shape. You will also be holding the other two links on your pinky, they should form a figure eight, with the other two bands passing through the center.9. At this point, I usually change the position of my hands. Now ,hold the figure eight together with your thumb and middle finger, trying not to disrupt the other ones too much! Try to maintain the diamond shape in some way, hold it however you are comfortable, in a way that will enable you to continue with these instructions.10. Select the link on the top, closest to you. (part of the diamond) Spin the link around so that the peak fits through the figure eight---also, make sure that once the peak is inside the figure eight it also passes through the band of the other part of the 'diamond' . When the link has been spun, and passed through the figure eight and the band of the remaining link, fold it downwards, so that it is flush with the two links that form a figure eight.11. Well, you made it to the last remaining link...congratulations!All you have to do now is carefully spin the last link so the peak fits between the peaks and gaps of the already mostly assembled ring (just spin it, no need to do anything fancy! ) Once the last remaining link has been passed through the ring, fold it down to lay flush with the rest of the links.12. Enjoy your puzzle ring!Solving your puzzle ring may have seemed difficult and awkward this time, but with practice it's actually quite simple. If you don't feel confident that you would be able to repeat this feat, I suggest taking the ring to a reputable jeweler to be soldered together! <end>  Confusing but not too bad`  I absolutely love the look of the ring! My friend took it apart, and I worked on it non-stop for almost a day before I looked up directions on-line. Once I foudn a couple sets, I compared them and it wasn't too bad to put back together.Again, I think the ring is gorgeous. <end>  Comes with Warnings!!!  this ring, i lovedwhen i got it..even betterbut i was so curiouse as to..if i could take it apart and put it back together. not even a week and i folled around with it, bad idea. it fell apart.i still cant get it together and been messing with it any chance i could get. the instructions it comes with isnt the best either. its all words and no images. kinda confusing. so do take apart but i warn you, you better be patient and very talented to get it together <end>  Tarnish Crap!  I ordered this ring and wore it a few times and it got all tarnished! So it is not Stainless Steel, and it wasnt worth sending it back! dont waste your money!!! <end>  gorgeous  i love puzzle rings. in england it's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazon <end>  It's a puzzler!  I do like this puzzle ring, even though I have not ventured to take it apart and reassemble it again. On my receipt, I saw an e-mail address for instructions on how to solve it, but the address didn't work. However, there are instructions at another site ([...]) for their claddagh puzzle rings that may be helpful if you can't solve it.All in all, a neat looking ring, but take it apart at your own risk!  ) <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Puzzle Band Ring Size  love this ring it is still in good condition and NOPE I never took it apart. I wanted to so bad but read on line it was very hard to get it back together. I had a lot of compliments on this one <end>  Great Ring! Challenging and Fun!  My boyfriend bought me this ring. I love it! A claddagh ring and a puzzle ring in one!! Great idea!It was tricky to put back together the first couple times, but I love a challenge (otherwise what's the point of a puzzle ring??) and now that I now how to do it I can put it back together in about a minute. Just don't force it - as many others have mentioned the individual rings are thin and bend easily. No force it necessary to get it back together, just a bit of finagling.I did find that it was a bit tarnished when I first took it apart but some baking soda and water polished it up nicely. It could have gotten five stars had it not been tarnished upon arrival. Boyfriend, however, does get five stars. <end>  bad idea.  I had this maybe two weeks before it broke. Junk. Thin week bands make for bad puzzle pieces. This thing will not stand up to daily wear for long. <end>  Love the ring!  I love my ring, although I have not tried to take it apart. I have always wanted a Claddagh ring and bought this for me for my birthday. I received it fast and it is beautiful. I have read the other reviews on how hard it is to take it apart or put it back together. I do not even want to try, I love it just the way it is! This is the second ring that I have ordered from Amazon.com and would recommend them to anyone that loves puzzle rings or Celtic jewelry! <end>  Fantastic  This is the most unique claddagh I've seen yet, a claddagh AND a puzzle ring. Great quality, quick shipping. I was very pleased. <end>  Awful  I ordered this ring for my daughter. It arrived severely tarnished. Because it was an inexpensive ring it didn't make sense to pay for shipping to send it back. We took the ring apart and used some silver polish on it. The tarnish came off but but so did silver coating also the ring is impossible to put back together. The instructions aren't for this ring in particular and aren't very clear. Not to mention how flimsy the metal is. Not a good buy. <end>  Other Opinion  I have read the other reviews about the weak metal, and the fact that people can't put the ring back together. My husband bought this ring for me and I could not even take it apart. Puzzle rings in general are thinner so they break and bend easily if your not careful. My husband bought it a lil too small, so I had it resized... the jeweler didn't want to until I said that I didn't care about the fact that it would never come apart. I love it and it is a great sign of love between us. <end>  An enjoyable piece  While not an exceptional ring, this is still an enjoyable piece for fans of either the Claddagh or puzzle rings in general.Both my wife and I wear a Claddagh for our wedding rings. The puzzle rings came this afternoon and while my wife hasn't dismantled hers just yet I simply couldn't wait. This, like most puzzle rings, is tricky and requires a certain amount of dexterity and patience. After playing with it for a couple of horus I succumbed and found a very useful video tutorial by Googling '4BDS Puzzle Ring Solution Video'While I feel like I cheated some; the solution, once you've learned it, comes pretty readily to mind.The only reason I held back on 5 stars is the metal bands have become somewhat warped in my frustrated gropings! The inside of the bands will appear damaged and tarnished - I imagine this ring may be silver plated. From other reviewers' mention of allergic reactions, don't be fooled in thinking this is a sterling silver ring. <end>  Claddagh Puzzle Ring  Nice ring for price. We have found the silver to be a little soft. Bends easily. The instructions on the Internet are not ring specific for this item, therefore we are afraid to even take it apart. Needs better instructions written for specific rings. <end>  Puzzle Ring Plus  This ring is awesome. It is well made and amazing how it fits together. My only complaint is that the idea of a puzzle ring is misleading. I thought that all four bands would come totally apart from each other. I was going to keep two rings for myself and give two rings to another person as a representation that we are two pieces, but when we are together we are whole. The problem is the rings are all inter-looped, so in order to do this I am going to have to cut them and solder them together. The other thing was, which is good for someone who doesn't want to worry about it falling apart....is that once I clipped the white band that was holding it together, it didn't fall all apart. I was expecting it to just fall to pieces. I literally had to struggle and pull at it to get it to come apart....in fact I lost patience in getting it apart and had to give it to someone else to pull apart. So as long as you aren't trying to use it like I wanted to, this ring is perfect for you. It doesn't come apart easily and they are all looped together so you can't lose any of the pieces. <end>  Be careful about sizing  This was given to me as a gift, and the person who gave it to me based the sizing on the sizing of the rest of the rings I wear. However, whatwe discovered is that these rings are a bit bulky (of course, that's what puzzle rings are about!), so mine is a bit too tight. I think Silver Insanity's website has instructions on sizing, but just in case that isn't an option I recommend goinga size larger. <end>  waste of money  I bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart. The bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled. Poor quality, I am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring, or the fragile nature of the metal. I wish I had my 25 bucks back. <end>  Awful ring..  Well atleast the package came quickly, cause the ring is horrible. I took it apart to see if I could put it back together, and what do I see, but the entire inside of the ring is tarnished. I used jewelery polish, and still couldn't get the ring to a silver look. Oh, and one of the bands snapped when I tried to put it back together for the first time. I contacted the seller, and am trying to get a refund. Hopefully their service is better than their products. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is my fave ring of all time. It comes with a string around it so it won't fall a part when you take it out of the box. Although, mine has to never come apart. It doesn't just fall apart like some of the looser knots do. I got a size 9 & it is a heavy ring so if you don't like heavy rings this one might not be for you.I love this ring & the company has a video you can watch & learn to how to put it, & other puzzle rings, back together. The indviual bands are thin & can bend so you have to be nice it, but it is well worth the money. <end>  It's terrible  I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring. We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless. <end>  pretty, but flimsy ring with useless assembly instructions  The ring is very pretty, but the instructions to reassemble the ring are useless and you have to be very careful with the individual rings as they are very thin metal. <end>  a puzzler!  I loved this ring the moment I saw it, and begged my boyfriend to buy it for me for christmas.When I got it, I immediatly put it on. I thought "Well, I wonder how it comes apart."BIG MISTAKE!It still hasn't been put back together, after two months, and every person in my family tried. I suggest that it come with instructions. (yes, even though this defeats the purpose) <end>  Watch out for sensitive skin  I purchased this ring for my girlfriend for Christmas after she mentioned having a claddagh ring before that broke. I think it is a really cool design and thought she'd enjoy the fact that it is a puzzle ring. And while she was really excited and likes the ring a lot she can not wear it for long periods of time due to the fact that it causes her to get blisters on her finger due to something in the metal. After later doing research on this I learned that there is a sizable number of people allergic to nickel which I suspect is present in this ring. <end>  Looks nice  I haven't disassembled it yet for fear of not being able to put it back together again. Doesn't look too hard, but judging by other reviewers' experiences, I decided not to try my luck. It looks quite nice the way it is.Once again, Silver Insanity did an excellent job. Amazon had mistakenly placed two orders, but Silver Insanity noticed it and called my attention to the fact. <end>  HELLLPPPPPP  Someone, please help me!!I have tried all the online help videos and guides and such, and I still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again!

In some areas of Turkey, they are the most common wedding band worn. Originally, they were intended to serve as a sort of motivator to keep married people faithful to one another. The theory was, if a spouse endeavored to commit adultery, they would first have to remove their wedding band, hiding their marital status from the potential fling. Since the rings are made up of interlocking bands, forming a pattern that requires knowledge to duplicate, once they are removed from the finger they fall apart quite easily...thus incriminating the guilty party.Today, these rings are worn mostly because of their beauty, not to mention the fact that they are excellent conversation pieces. They are a popular souvenier among tourists in the Middle East, especially Turkey. Many military personnel return from a tour of duty owning one or more of these rings, however, in time, the solution is forgotten!The following is a step by step solution for a thin band, four link puzzle ring.1. You will notice that the four bands are similar, but upon closer inspection there are slight differences. Two of the links have a simple peak to them, and the other two links have a dip and a peak. Look carefully to identify each link. At this time, single out the link that has a simple peak, with 4 etches carved into it. (The etches may be faint, compare the two simple peak links and choose the one with more grooves)2. Once you have found the simple peaked link with four grooves, hold that link only, letting the other links dangle. Turn the ring so that the top of the peak is pointing away from you. There should be two links dangling from the link you are holding, with the fourth link dangling from those two links.3. While still holding the four grooved link, take the other simple peaked link, which should be the one dangling from the bottom, and bring it up to meet with the one you are holding. You should now be holding the two links together, the bands of the links together, and the points of the peaks pointing outwards, opposite of each other (It should look like a diamond)4. Continue holding the links together with your thumb and pointer finger (you will need your other fingers for the next part).5. You will notice that you now have the two 'dip and peak' links dangling from the two links you are holding. Select the link on the right---this is trial and error, sometimes the correct link will be on the right already, and sometimes you may have to pass the wrong link over the top of the ring in order to place the correct link in the proper position. The two dangling links are very hard to tell apart, so you will discover which is the correct one for the next step by following these instructions  6. After grabbing the dangling link on the right, turn the link so that the peaks and dips face you. Looking at the link, notice the dips and peaks. You want the link that has peaks that point like arrows to the LEFT, then the right. (The other link has peaks that point like arrows to the RIGHT, then left )7. When you have found the correct link for the next step, hold it taut against the two simple peak bands you have been holding between your thumb and forefinger. The band of those two links should now be resting against the LEFT pointing peak of the selected link, and you should adjust your hands so that you are holding that link on your pinky, taut.8. With your free hand, grab the last remaining link. Turn the link so that the peaks and dips face the top of the ring (you should be holding the ring upright the entire time) Bring the remaining link towards the right, and overlap it with the link you're holding on your pinky. The easiest way to do this is to imagine you are trying to put the other link on your pinky with the one that's already there. If this is done correctly, you will still be holding the two simple peak links between your thumb and forefinger, and they will form a diamond shape. You will also be holding the other two links on your pinky, they should form a figure eight, with the other two bands passing through the center.9. At this point, I usually change the position of my hands. Now ,hold the figure eight together with your thumb and middle finger, trying not to disrupt the other ones too much! Try to maintain the diamond shape in some way, hold it however you are comfortable, in a way that will enable you to continue with these instructions.10. Select the link on the top, closest to you. (part of the diamond) Spin the link around so that the peak fits through the figure eight---also, make sure that once the peak is inside the figure eight it also passes through the band of the other part of the 'diamond' . When the link has been spun, and passed through the figure eight and the band of the remaining link, fold it downwards, so that it is flush with the two links that form a figure eight.11. Well, you made it to the last remaining link...congratulations!All you have to do now is carefully spin the last link so the peak fits between the peaks and gaps of the already mostly assembled ring (just spin it, no need to do anything fancy! ) Once the last remaining link has been passed through the ring, fold it down to lay flush with the rest of the links.12. Enjoy your puzzle ring!Solving your puzzle ring may have seemed difficult and awkward this time, but with practice it's actually quite simple. If you don't feel confident that you would be able to repeat this feat, I suggest taking the ring to a reputable jeweler to be soldered together! <end>  Confusing but not too bad`  I absolutely love the look of the ring! My friend took it apart, and I worked on it non-stop for almost a day before I looked up directions on-line. Once I foudn a couple sets, I compared them and it wasn't too bad to put back together.Again, I think the ring is gorgeous. <end>  Comes with Warnings!!!  this ring, i lovedwhen i got it..even betterbut i was so curiouse as to..if i could take it apart and put it back together. not even a week and i folled around with it, bad idea. it fell apart.i still cant get it together and been messing with it any chance i could get. the instructions it comes with isnt the best either. its all words and no images. kinda confusing. so do take apart but i warn you, you better be patient and very talented to get it together <end>  Tarnish Crap!  I ordered this ring and wore it a few times and it got all tarnished! So it is not Stainless Steel, and it wasnt worth sending it back! dont waste your money!!! <end>  gorgeous  i love puzzle rings. in england it's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazon <end>
 B00023K81G  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Puzzle Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  It's a puzzler!  I do like this puzzle ring, even though I have not ventured to take it apart and reassemble it again. On my receipt, I saw an e-mail address for instructions on how to solve it, but the address didn't work. However, there are instructions at another site ([...]) for their claddagh puzzle rings that may be helpful if you can't solve it.All in all, a neat looking ring, but take it apart at your own risk!  ) <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Puzzle Band Ring Size  love this ring it is still in good condition and NOPE I never took it apart. I wanted to so bad but read on line it was very hard to get it back together. I had a lot of compliments on this one <end>  Great Ring! Challenging and Fun!  My boyfriend bought me this ring. I love it! A claddagh ring and a puzzle ring in one!! Great idea!It was tricky to put back together the first couple times, but I love a challenge (otherwise what's the point of a puzzle ring??) and now that I now how to do it I can put it back together in about a minute. Just don't force it - as many others have mentioned the individual rings are thin and bend easily. No force it necessary to get it back together, just a bit of finagling.I did find that it was a bit tarnished when I first took it apart but some baking soda and water polished it up nicely. It could have gotten five stars had it not been tarnished upon arrival. Boyfriend, however, does get five stars. <end>  bad idea.  I had this maybe two weeks before it broke. Junk. Thin week bands make for bad puzzle pieces. This thing will not stand up to daily wear for long. <end>  Love the ring!  I love my ring, although I have not tried to take it apart. I have always wanted a Claddagh ring and bought this for me for my birthday. I received it fast and it is beautiful. I have read the other reviews on how hard it is to take it apart or put it back together. I do not even want to try, I love it just the way it is! This is the second ring that I have ordered from Amazon.com and would recommend them to anyone that loves puzzle rings or Celtic jewelry! <end>  Fantastic  This is the most unique claddagh I've seen yet, a claddagh AND a puzzle ring. Great quality, quick shipping. I was very pleased. <end>  Awful  I ordered this ring for my daughter. It arrived severely tarnished. Because it was an inexpensive ring it didn't make sense to pay for shipping to send it back. We took the ring apart and used some silver polish on it. The tarnish came off but but so did silver coating also the ring is impossible to put back together. The instructions aren't for this ring in particular and aren't very clear. Not to mention how flimsy the metal is. Not a good buy. <end>  Other Opinion  I have read the other reviews about the weak metal, and the fact that people can't put the ring back together. My husband bought this ring for me and I could not even take it apart. Puzzle rings in general are thinner so they break and bend easily if your not careful. My husband bought it a lil too small, so I had it resized... the jeweler didn't want to until I said that I didn't care about the fact that it would never come apart. I love it and it is a great sign of love between us. <end>  An enjoyable piece  While not an exceptional ring, this is still an enjoyable piece for fans of either the Claddagh or puzzle rings in general.Both my wife and I wear a Claddagh for our wedding rings. The puzzle rings came this afternoon and while my wife hasn't dismantled hers just yet I simply couldn't wait. This, like most puzzle rings, is tricky and requires a certain amount of dexterity and patience. After playing with it for a couple of horus I succumbed and found a very useful video tutorial by Googling '4BDS Puzzle Ring Solution Video'While I feel like I cheated some; the solution, once you've learned it, comes pretty readily to mind.The only reason I held back on 5 stars is the metal bands have become somewhat warped in my frustrated gropings! The inside of the bands will appear damaged and tarnished - I imagine this ring may be silver plated. From other reviewers' mention of allergic reactions, don't be fooled in thinking this is a sterling silver ring. <end>  Claddagh Puzzle Ring  Nice ring for price. We have found the silver to be a little soft. Bends easily. The instructions on the Internet are not ring specific for this item, therefore we are afraid to even take it apart. Needs better instructions written for specific rings. <end>  Present for Daughter  I bought this as a present for my daughter. I was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring. (If anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together, check wikipedia. I believe there is even a video.) I highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver, symbolism, and something just a little bit different. <end>  Nice ring  Nice ring, fast delivery. I still need to check it out, because my daughter says it doesn't completely "break down" the way my old puzzle ring did. <end>  if only i could put it back together!  I got this ring for my girlfriend for her birthday. We both loved it, it is really quite beautiful. Yet we still can't put it back together. It has been apart for about two months now, it's really disappointing. If you're amazing at putting things together, than you'll like it. If you're not, you'll probably still like it, but you might wan to leave it together. <end>  Rings were beautiful...the puzzle not so...  I bought two of the claddagh puzzle rings for me and my boyfriend for christmas. I was so excited that I recieved them by Christmas. The rings looked as I expected them too and I was thrilled to have matching rings for my boyfriend and I. However I was very very dissapointed when my puzzle ring fell apart and ther was no directions to put it back together. It fell apart the first night I got it before I had the chance to give my boyfriend his, which of course again very dissapointing seeing as I bought it as christmas presents. I tried for several hours that night to get it back together and so did other family members but no luck. We even got instructions with diagrams and watched a movie of it but it still wouldn't go back together. Luckily my boyfriends hasn't fell apart yet nor has he taken it apart after hearing my horor story of it. I had to buy a new ring from them just to have our matching rings because we are getting our pictures taken together. Hopefully it will arive soon and then when it does I am wrapping something around it to get it to stay together before I can get it welded. But its pretty dissapointing I have to do this seeing as its suppose to be a puzzle ring. All in all though they are pretty beautiful rings just be careful with them and don't take them apart unless you have plenty of time trying to figure out how to put them back together or you plan on spending another 20 plus shipping for a new ring. By the way you can't send the ring back for a refund unless it is assembled so beware of that too. The company itself gets a good rating from me though. <end>  Wow  I got a lot of shipping alerts and was confused as to when it would arrive, but i got it now and I couldn't be more pleased!!! gorgeous! I can't wait to take it apart and put it back together again!! Perfect for puzzle lovers! <end>  gripkid  I really love this ring! I mainly got it because they showed it on an episode of the Buffy the vampire slayer for a big fan one of these rings are a must! I haven't ventured to take it apart...YET and to be honest by the looks of these reviews it'll be a long time before i do *give me two-three days* haha BUT i did find some instructions from the website silver sanity that sells these the the website that they put on the reciept is kinda funky and i had to google it just to get to the right page but i'll post it on here seeing as no one else has---How to assemble a four link puzzle ring, step by step.Puzzles rings are a most intriguing piece of jewelry, with an interesting lore attached to them. In some areas of Turkey, they are the most common wedding band worn. Originally, they were intended to serve as a sort of motivator to keep married people faithful to one another. The theory was, if a spouse endeavored to commit adultery, they would first have to remove their wedding band, hiding their marital status from the potential fling. Since the rings are made up of interlocking bands, forming a pattern that requires knowledge to duplicate, once they are removed from the finger they fall apart quite easily...thus incriminating the guilty party.Today, these rings are worn mostly because of their beauty, not to mention the fact that they are excellent conversation pieces. They are a popular souvenier among tourists in the Middle East, especially Turkey.

I ordered this ring and wore it a few times and it got all tarnished! So it is not Stainless Steel, and it wasnt worth sending it back! dont waste your money!!! <end>  gorgeous  i love puzzle rings. in england it's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazon <end>  Be careful about sizing  This was given to me as a gift, and the person who gave it to me based the sizing on the sizing of the rest of the rings I wear. However, whatwe discovered is that these rings are a bit bulky (of course, that's what puzzle rings are about!), so mine is a bit too tight. I think Silver Insanity's website has instructions on sizing, but just in case that isn't an option I recommend goinga size larger. <end>  waste of money  I bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart. The bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled. Poor quality, I am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring, or the fragile nature of the metal. I wish I had my 25 bucks back. <end>  Awful ring..  Well atleast the package came quickly, cause the ring is horrible. I took it apart to see if I could put it back together, and what do I see, but the entire inside of the ring is tarnished. I used jewelery polish, and still couldn't get the ring to a silver look. Oh, and one of the bands snapped when I tried to put it back together for the first time. I contacted the seller, and am trying to get a refund. Hopefully their service is better than their products. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is my fave ring of all time. It comes with a string around it so it won't fall a part when you take it out of the box. Although, mine has to never come apart. It doesn't just fall apart like some of the looser knots do. I got a size 9 & it is a heavy ring so if you don't like heavy rings this one might not be for you.I love this ring & the company has a video you can watch & learn to how to put it, & other puzzle rings, back together. The indviual bands are thin & can bend so you have to be nice it, but it is well worth the money. <end>  It's terrible  I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring. We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless. <end>  pretty, but flimsy ring with useless assembly instructions  The ring is very pretty, but the instructions to reassemble the ring are useless and you have to be very careful with the individual rings as they are very thin metal. <end>  a puzzler!  I loved this ring the moment I saw it, and begged my boyfriend to buy it for me for christmas.When I got it, I immediatly put it on. I thought "Well, I wonder how it comes apart."BIG MISTAKE!It still hasn't been put back together, after two months, and every person in my family tried. I suggest that it come with instructions. (yes, even though this defeats the purpose) <end>  Watch out for sensitive skin  I purchased this ring for my girlfriend for Christmas after she mentioned having a claddagh ring before that broke. I think it is a really cool design and thought she'd enjoy the fact that it is a puzzle ring. And while she was really excited and likes the ring a lot she can not wear it for long periods of time due to the fact that it causes her to get blisters on her finger due to something in the metal. After later doing research on this I learned that there is a sizable number of people allergic to nickel which I suspect is present in this ring. <end>  Looks nice  I haven't disassembled it yet for fear of not being able to put it back together again. Doesn't look too hard, but judging by other reviewers' experiences, I decided not to try my luck. It looks quite nice the way it is.Once again, Silver Insanity did an excellent job. Amazon had mistakenly placed two orders, but Silver Insanity noticed it and called my attention to the fact. <end>  HELLLPPPPPP  Someone, please help me!!I have tried all the online help videos and guides and such, and I still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again! PLEASE HELP! <end>  Puzzle Ring Plus  This ring is awesome. It is well made and amazing how it fits together. My only complaint is that the idea of a puzzle ring is misleading. I thought that all four bands would come totally apart from each other. I was going to keep two rings for myself and give two rings to another person as a representation that we are two pieces, but when we are together we are whole. The problem is the rings are all inter-looped, so in order to do this I am going to have to cut them and solder them together. The other thing was, which is good for someone who doesn't want to worry about it falling apart....is that once I clipped the white band that was holding it together, it didn't fall all apart. I was expecting it to just fall to pieces. I literally had to struggle and pull at it to get it to come apart....in fact I lost patience in getting it apart and had to give it to someone else to pull apart. So as long as you aren't trying to use it like I wanted to, this ring is perfect for you. It doesn't come apart easily and they are all looped together so you can't lose any of the pieces. <end>  Present for Daughter  I bought this as a present for my daughter. I was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring. (If anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together, check wikipedia. I believe there is even a video.) I highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver, symbolism, and something just a little bit different. <end>  Nice ring  Nice ring, fast delivery.

Well, you made it to the last remaining link...congratulations!All you have to do now is carefully spin the last link so the peak fits between the peaks and gaps of the already mostly assembled ring (just spin it, no need to do anything fancy! ) Once the last remaining link has been passed through the ring, fold it down to lay flush with the rest of the links.12. Enjoy your puzzle ring!Solving your puzzle ring may have seemed difficult and awkward this time, but with practice it's actually quite simple. If you don't feel confident that you would be able to repeat this feat, I suggest taking the ring to a reputable jeweler to be soldered together! <end>  Confusing but not too bad`  I absolutely love the look of the ring! My friend took it apart, and I worked on it non-stop for almost a day before I looked up directions on-line. Once I foudn a couple sets, I compared them and it wasn't too bad to put back together.Again, I think the ring is gorgeous. <end>  Comes with Warnings!!!  this ring, i lovedwhen i got it..even betterbut i was so curiouse as to..if i could take it apart and put it back together. not even a week and i folled around with it, bad idea. it fell apart.i still cant get it together and been messing with it any chance i could get. the instructions it comes with isnt the best either. its all words and no images. kinda confusing. so do take apart but i warn you, you better be patient and very talented to get it together <end>  Tarnish Crap!  I ordered this ring and wore it a few times and it got all tarnished! So it is not Stainless Steel, and it wasnt worth sending it back! dont waste your money!!! <end>  gorgeous  i love puzzle rings. in england it's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazon <end>  It's a puzzler!  I do like this puzzle ring, even though I have not ventured to take it apart and reassemble it again. On my receipt, I saw an e-mail address for instructions on how to solve it, but the address didn't work. However, there are instructions at another site ([...]) for their claddagh puzzle rings that may be helpful if you can't solve it.All in all, a neat looking ring, but take it apart at your own risk!  ) <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Puzzle Band Ring Size  love this ring it is still in good condition and NOPE I never took it apart. I wanted to so bad but read on line it was very hard to get it back together. I had a lot of compliments on this one <end>  Great Ring! Challenging and Fun!  My boyfriend bought me this ring. I love it! A claddagh ring and a puzzle ring in one!! Great idea!It was tricky to put back together the first couple times, but I love a challenge (otherwise what's the point of a puzzle ring??) and now that I now how to do it I can put it back together in about a minute. Just don't force it - as many others have mentioned the individual rings are thin and bend easily. No force it necessary to get it back together, just a bit of finagling.I did find that it was a bit tarnished when I first took it apart but some baking soda and water polished it up nicely. It could have gotten five stars had it not been tarnished upon arrival. Boyfriend, however, does get five stars. <end>  bad idea.  I had this maybe two weeks before it broke. Junk. Thin week bands make for bad puzzle pieces. This thing will not stand up to daily wear for long. <end>  Love the ring!  I love my ring, although I have not tried to take it apart. I have always wanted a Claddagh ring and bought this for me for my birthday. I received it fast and it is beautiful. I have read the other reviews on how hard it is to take it apart or put it back together. I do not even want to try, I love it just the way it is! This is the second ring that I have ordered from Amazon.com and would recommend them to anyone that loves puzzle rings or Celtic jewelry! <end>  Fantastic  This is the most unique claddagh I've seen yet, a claddagh AND a puzzle ring. Great quality, quick shipping. I was very pleased. <end>  Awful  I ordered this ring for my daughter. It arrived severely tarnished. Because it was an inexpensive ring it didn't make sense to pay for shipping to send it back. We took the ring apart and used some silver polish on it. The tarnish came off but but so did silver coating also the ring is impossible to put back together. The instructions aren't for this ring in particular and aren't very clear. Not to mention how flimsy the metal is. Not a good buy. <end>  Other Opinion  I have read the other reviews about the weak metal, and the fact that people can't put the ring back together. My husband bought this ring for me and I could not even take it apart. Puzzle rings in general are thinner so they break and bend easily if your not careful. My husband bought it a lil too small, so I had it resized... the jeweler didn't want to until I said that I didn't care about the fact that it would never come apart. I love it and it is a great sign of love between us. <end>  An enjoyable piece  While not an exceptional ring, this is still an enjoyable piece for fans of either the Claddagh or puzzle rings in general.Both my wife and I wear a Claddagh for our wedding rings. The puzzle rings came this afternoon and while my wife hasn't dismantled hers just yet I simply couldn't wait. This, like most puzzle rings, is tricky and requires a certain amount of dexterity and patience. After playing with it for a couple of horus I succumbed and found a very useful video tutorial by Googling '4BDS Puzzle Ring Solution Video'While I feel like I cheated some; the solution, once you've learned it, comes pretty readily to mind.The only reason I held back on 5 stars is the metal bands have become somewhat warped in my frustrated gropings! The inside of the bands will appear damaged and tarnished - I imagine this ring may be silver plated. From other reviewers' mention of allergic reactions, don't be fooled in thinking this is a sterling silver ring. <end>  Claddagh Puzzle Ring  Nice ring for price. We have found the silver to be a little soft. Bends easily. The instructions on the Internet are not ring specific for this item, therefore we are afraid to even take it apart. Needs better instructions written for specific rings. <end>  Puzzle Ring Plus  This ring is awesome. It is well made and amazing how it fits together. My only complaint is that the idea of a puzzle ring is misleading. I thought that all four bands would come totally apart from each other. I was going to keep two rings for myself and give two rings to another person as a representation that we are two pieces, but when we are together we are whole. The problem is the rings are all inter-looped, so in order to do this I am going to have to cut them and solder them together. The other thing was, which is good for someone who doesn't want to worry about it falling apart....is that once I clipped the white band that was holding it together, it didn't fall all apart. I was expecting it to just fall to pieces. I literally had to struggle and pull at it to get it to come apart....in fact I lost patience in getting it apart and had to give it to someone else to pull apart. So as long as you aren't trying to use it like I wanted to, this ring is perfect for you. It doesn't come apart easily and they are all looped together so you can't lose any of the pieces. <end>  Be careful about sizing  This was given to me as a gift, and the person who gave it to me based the sizing on the sizing of the rest of the rings I wear. However, whatwe discovered is that these rings are a bit bulky (of course, that's what puzzle rings are about!), so mine is a bit too tight. I think Silver Insanity's website has instructions on sizing, but just in case that isn't an option I recommend goinga size larger. <end>  waste of money  I bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart. The bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled. Poor quality, I am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring, or the fragile nature of the metal. I wish I had my 25 bucks back. <end>  Awful ring..  Well atleast the package came quickly, cause the ring is horrible. I took it apart to see if I could put it back together, and what do I see, but the entire inside of the ring is tarnished. I used jewelery polish, and still couldn't get the ring to a silver look. Oh, and one of the bands snapped when I tried to put it back together for the first time. I contacted the seller, and am trying to get a refund. Hopefully their service is better than their products. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is my fave ring of all time. It comes with a string around it so it won't fall a part when you take it out of the box. Although, mine has to never come apart. It doesn't just fall apart like some of the looser knots do. I got a size 9 & it is a heavy ring so if you don't like heavy rings this one might not be for you.I love this ring & the company has a video you can watch & learn to how to put it, & other puzzle rings, back together. The indviual bands are thin & can bend so you have to be nice it, but it is well worth the money. <end>  It's terrible  I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring. We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless. <end>  pretty, but flimsy ring with useless assembly instructions  The ring is very pretty, but the instructions to reassemble the ring are useless and you have to be very careful with the individual rings as they are very thin metal. <end>  a puzzler!  I loved this ring the moment I saw it, and begged my boyfriend to buy it for me for christmas.When I got it, I immediatly put it on. I thought "Well, I wonder how it comes apart."BIG MISTAKE!It still hasn't been put back together, after two months, and every person in my family tried. I suggest that it come with instructions. (yes, even though this defeats the purpose) <end>  Watch out for sensitive skin  I purchased this ring for my girlfriend for Christmas after she mentioned having a claddagh ring before that broke. I think it is a really cool design and thought she'd enjoy the fact that it is a puzzle ring. And while she was really excited and likes the ring a lot she can not wear it for long periods of time due to the fact that it causes her to get blisters on her finger due to something in the metal. After later doing research on this I learned that there is a sizable number of people allergic to nickel which I suspect is present in this ring. <end>  Looks nice  I haven't disassembled it yet for fear of not being able to put it back together again. Doesn't look too hard, but judging by other reviewers' experiences, I decided not to try my luck. It looks quite nice the way it is.Once again, Silver Insanity did an excellent job. Amazon had mistakenly placed two orders, but Silver Insanity noticed it and called my attention to the fact. <end>  HELLLPPPPPP  Someone, please help me!!I have tried all the online help videos and guides and such, and I still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again! PLEASE HELP! <end>
 B00023K83O  Sterling Silver Greek Key Worry Spin Ring(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Nice Ring  I was told that the wide of this ring was 3/8" and was 1/4" I realize about that until I received it. I didn't get what I wanted. The ring its ok. <end>
 B00023K85M  Amethyst and Green Peridot Gemstone Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Great value!  Purchased these earrings since one birthstone is both mine and my wife's and the other our son's. The earrings look great, and feel much more expensive then price paid. The earring posts are longer than pictured (perhaps the design was changed), so my wife had not had a need for earring backs. She also has skin irritation from most jewelry, and the great thing is these earrings have not bothered her at all since wearing them at least a half dozen times.Shipping was lightening fast, ordered them the evening of the 17th and they arrived the 19th. <end>  Colorful and fun  I get compliments on these earrings whenever I wear them. They're colorful and lightweight. Be sure to wear with an earring back. <end>
 B00023K8BG  Long Sterling Silver Pendulum Drop Yoga Earrings of Balance ||	  Simply elegant drop earrings  I have no idea what the previous reviewer was talking about. He/she must have meant to review another item, because this has no green beads or crystals. They are long silver teardrops with a silver pole with a small round silver bead hanging in the middle. From hook to bottom of earring, they're a little longer than my pinkie finger (a couple inches). I've only worn them once, but I've already gotten a compliment or two. I also like that they're lightweight but still sturdy enough that I can tell that they'll last well.Occasionally, the ball swings enough to hit the side of the drop, making a faint chime. It's nothing annoying, but I do notice it from time to time. IF that sort of thing irritates you, you should skip these (but know that it's barely noticeable)!Additionally, Silver Insanity - the vendor - was a pleasure to deal with, and I received a personal email from them about shipping before Amazon emailed me to let me know it had shipped. Some companies don't bother with contacting you unless there's a problem, so it was a nice touch. These arrived more quickly than I expected, packaged in a small box with my other earrings. Each pair was in a small plastic bag, and I loved them all! <end>  so-so  I really liked these earrings, however the pendulum in the middle kept getting stuck on things. I wish they would have made it stationary. <end>  These are beautiful!  I expected these to be a bit bigger but they are smallerthan one expects(I though the hoops would be larger.But I'm not that disappointed. The green beads(crystals?)look very nice. These are perfect for casual as well as formalevents. Very lightweight too! I have another pair in red.Just gorgeous! <end>
 B00023K8EI  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Cross Stud Post Earrings ||	  Excellent Item  Very nice jewelry for an extremely low price. Shipped and received very quickly. <end>  This was the perfect size!  I needed a pair of ear rings to match a celtic cross necklace I gave to my soon to be daughter-in-law only problem was she will only wear small post style ear rings. I was afraid that if I found the right size they may very well be flimsy and break. But when I got this pair they were not only the right size (just covers the small area around piercing on ear lob) but very well made and great detail work. A perfect match. And she loved them! <end>  very cute  very cute pair of stud earrings, i was afraid that they would be too small, but they were just perfect <end>  great earrings  I ordered these for my daughter. They came well before the deadline and are of terrific quality--they are very sturdy. They're really nice looking too. <end>  Well Done but Very Small  I guess that I thought I was going to get a bigger earring when I ordered these, that was my fault, I'm sure they are listed accurately, but I neglected to read far enough. That being said, the detail in these is very good, I just wish they were a bit bigger <end>  I LOVE THESE EARRINGS!  I usually don't like studs, but here in Alaska earrings that hang catch in scarves and get extra cold freezing your earlobe. These studs are not too big or too small and they're not boring plain studs. <end>  Celtic Cross  These earrings were smaller than what i thought they would be but i still love them <end>
 B00023K8ES  Sterling Silver Dueling DRAGON Serpent Hook Earrings ||	  VERY COOL  IF YOU LIKE DRAGONS, THESE ARE GREAT.I PERSONALLY AM INTO DRAGONS, SO I LOVE THEM.DOWNSIDE, NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR MY STYLE, BUT, THEY ARE VERY NICE..... <end>  My favorite pair of earrings  I have owned these for a long time now and they are awesome. The material is reliable and doesnt bend and the shine is intact. <end>  some what disappointed  I love the earrings but wish they had been solid, rather then a cookie cutter cutout. <end>
 B00023K8GQ  Sterling Silver Celtic Knotted Latch-Down Hoop Earrings ||	  Celtic Grinch  The earrings broke in my fiance's ear as she was trying them on Christmas morning. I was very embarassed. <end>  Beautiful designs  The design of these earrings is beautiful. There would be one change I would suggest. The depth of the post is a little long. I have chubby earlobes, and the earrings still rock back and forth a lot.I still wear them because they are very pretty and I have received comments on them. <end>
 B00023K8MK  Small Classy KNOTTED Post Stud Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Very poor quality  I got these earrings and as soon as i tried to take them out of the package they bent all over the place. i tried straghtening it out, big mistake, and they only got worse. Do not get these, they look pretty, but they are a very flimsy pair of earrings. <end>  My new everyday earrings!  I bought two pairs of these earrings. I wear them all the time. They are sturdy and beautiful. <end>  earrings  Ok but alot larger thean I thought they would be. Think I will give them as a gift this Christmas. <end>  knotty  These earring are so cute! just as cute in life as they are in the picture! I love them so much that I bought a second pair for my mom. <end>  Tarnished  These earrings were very pretty when I first received them. After I had them about 6 months the knots tarnished. The posts stayed a pretty silver, maybe the description only said the posts are sterling silver. <end>
 B00023K8NO  Sterling Silver OM Hindu Symbol Dangle Hook Earrings ||	  great ohm/om symbol earrings....  Simple, elegant, and meaningful earrings. That also happen to look great with just about everything. I've had strangers come up to me and actually compliment these earrings! <end>  I'm jealous, it's a gift  I bought this for a gift for my girl-friend, she'll love it.Nice quality earrings. <end>  Beautiful and well made!  I love these earrings so much I am giving them to my best friend as a special gift (even though I ordered them for myself!). Now I need to order myself a pair! I love the symbol om, as it represents the sound and vibration of everything. A sign of peace. Wearing them is a wonderful way to share this message with others! <end>  Exactly what I wanted  I ordered the earrings as a gift for my daughter. They were packaged well. They look even nicer than the picture suggests. Excellent value for money - and my daughter loves them!!! <end>
 B00023K8NY  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Green Malachite Inlay Heart Earrings ||	  Big & Beautiful!  I purchased these earrings, the matching ring, and the matching necklace...stunning jewelry. I get so many comments about how gorgeous these items are every time I wear one. I have purchased these items as Christmas presents for family members who loved them as a surprise. They are all sturdy, high quality items that I am proud to wear. I could not recommend them more highly, and, the price is unbeatable! <end>  Lovely  Very happy with these earrings. They are much nicer than the picture - glossy and shiny. <end>
 B00023K8O8  Pig Sterling Silver PIGGY Post Stud Earrings Happy Pigs ||	  Cute little piggies!  I bought these earrings for my friend who LOVES pigs. They are very small, but totally cute! My friend loved them! <end>  Pig Lovers!  These earrings are great for anyone who collects pigs...they are tiny, but they are pigs. <end>
 B00023K91A  Sterling Silver Poison Pillbox AMETHYST Locket Pendant ||	  Broken Pendant  I ordered several of these pendants back in March for gifts. I've given them all away now except for one, and I'm dismayed to find that the top is not connected in any way to the bottom. I didn't even think to check the merchandise when it arrived because it all looked perfect. The top is not connected to the "loop" that is on the bottom part of the pendant. There are 3 loops - the middle one that should be connected to the decorative top and allow it to "open" seems fused to the outer loops.Would it be possible to exchange this pendant for one that isn't defective? <end>  Beautiful keepsake  Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. I wanted her to have something that she could have forever, and that was real silver with semi-precious stone.It's beautiful, and she was absolutely thrilled. I would buy one again. The only complaint is that the hinge joining the two pieces broke. It's still very good and functional.... <end>  not very functional  Opening this locket is difficult. There really isn't a clasp to help you separate the two halves, you just sort of pull them apart. The inside is just like an empty box there's no slot for the pictures. As a pendant it's very pretty, but not a very functional locket. It also does not come with a chain. <end>
 B00023K9DS  Sterling Silver Garnet Celtic Knot Bangle Cuff Bracelet ||	  Sterling Silver GARNET CELTIC Knot Bangle Cuff Bracelet  I'm very pleased with this item. It is as described, very good quality and workmanship. The stone has a rich color and is securely set. The pattern is even and well proportioned. The silver is highly polished, heavy,and yet delicate in appearance. <end>  pretty, delicate design, nicely crafted  The bracelet didn't look as I expected from looking at the picture, but is very pretty. I didn't realize it would be so delicate-looking, because there is nothing to compare it to in the image. It is very nice, though. It is small/thin, the kind of thing you might wear with a dress, yet seems strong. The metalwork seems done well and I think it's a bracelet that would be right for wearing someplace special. <end>  flimsy  Bought this bracelet as a companion to their very nice Celtic garnet ring. However, this piece is very thin and flimsy with a small stone. Also, the latch mechanism design is almost impossible to connect without someone else's assistance. <end>  Nice  While a nice little bracelet, it is not adjustable and is a bit too large for my wrist making the clasp pop open at times. Too round, needs to be more oval to fit the writst better. <end>  Nice looking but be careful  I like the look of this Celtic bracelet on my girlfriend's wrist. But several times it has come off. The latching mechanism needs to be more secure to keep it from coming off. I "bent" mine and it seems to stay on better. <end>  Silver Garnet Celtic Knot Bracelet  Bracelet bends too easily. After two weeks the stone popped out. Still cannot find it. Would not recommend buying this bracelet. <end>  Beautiful  The bracelet is very pretty. Simple - just like I like. The clasp pops open sometimes but it fits my wrist beautifully. A very nice addition to my daily jewelry. <end>  Decent.  The bracelet is a lot smaller and more delicate than the picture leads you to believe. However, it is a nice piece of silver. <end>  simple beauty  I bought this bracelet as a gift for my sister. She doesn't wear much jewelry so I was looking for something simple but elegant. When I saw it I thought it could barely fit a baby but then I put it on and to my surprise it fit my wrist...I do not have slim wrists so I was very surprised it fit. It is very simple and you could wear it dressed up or with a t-shirt and jeans and it would look good. She loved it and now I am considering buying one for myself and some friends of mine. <end>
 B00023K9GA  Nice SEA TURTLE 7" Sterling Silver Bracelet of Turtles ||	  cute,but dangerous  The turtles limbs get caught on things, creating pulls and rips in sweaters and blankets. Too bad, a cute bracelet at a fair price. <end>
 B00023K9J2  5mm Diamond-Cut Sterling Silver Rope Chain 24" Necklace ||	  Sterling necklace  Very nice quality. Will have no hesitation to purchase from this company again in the future. Good product quality and prompt service. <end>  Nice peace.  So far so good, not sure what I can clean it with so I don't wear it much.But it's the bling of bling in a rope that shines and feels good on you.Kind of pricy, but I believe if you wear it sparingly, watch what you clean it with, and don't swim or shower in it, it will last. <end>
 B00023K9TW  Sterling Silver Ball Ends Charm Bangle Cuff Bracelet For Charms and Beads ||	  Wonderful additonal to your collection  I love charm bracelets, but was sick of having one just like everyone else. I found some WONDERFUL sterling silver beads at a beads store near our house, and added all my cahrms to this bangle. I get SO many compliments on it! <end>  Bangle Cuff Bracelet makes it easy to build a bracelet  This bangle is great...much easier than a traditional chain charm bracelet for creating your own charm bracelet. I highly recommend it. <end>
 B00023KAG4  Classic Christian Fish Sterling Silver Charm Pendant ||	  Silver pendant  Nice fish pendant, but not what I wanted. Wanted for a necklace. Would be nice is it was smaller, more delicate. <end>
 B00023KAGE  Sterling Silver 5-Stone RAINBOW MOONSTONE Necklace ||	  A child's necklace  I didn't realize at the time of purchase that the size of this necklace is so small. I ended up saving it for a present to a small child. It is pretty, just not what I had wanted.Ordering and shipping was fine. <end>
 B00023LTIW  White Gold Diamond (.06 ctw) Star Pendant with 16in. chain ||	  nice, but overpriced  I own this piece of jewelery and ordered it 3 years ago. I enjoy it, but i did not pay over 150 dollars for this. its not worth more than that anyway as its is not that big as far as shape and diamond weight/quality. <end>
 B00023LUWM  Diamond Initial Pendant "I" in 14k Yellow Gold ||	  "I" of the beholder  Now, you mays be wonderin why a man named "cousinpaco" would strut around wearing the letter "I" around his neck. After all, it's obvious that "cousinpaco" starts with the letter "c."Well, let me tell you, holmes.When people axe me about it, I simply points to my chest and says "'Cause I is the greatest!"The bejeweled capital letter can also double as a Roman numeral, signifying that cousinpaco is Number One. Numero uno. And that's who cousinpaco always looks out for.Some might call my attitude "sef-absorbed," to which I reply  "Then I guess that makes me super-absorbent Bounty, the quicker picker-upper." Since I's also good at pickin' up the ladies, that statement makes double sense. Of course, that would mean I should gets a "B" necklace, but I don't wanna be confusin' peoples.It's all about the bling.Word. <end>
 B00023RRPQ  X - Sterling Silver Turquoise Bead Comfort Coil Bracelet ||	  Beautiful Bracelet  This is a gorgeous bracelet. The colors are varying shades of blue and green turquoise. It really is comfortable as advertised. I have gotten many compliments on this bracelet. If you like coil bracelets, buy this one! <end>

 B00024ODXY  Amazon.com  Jewelry Roll by Lewis N. Clark  Clothing ||	  All the right pockets  This is a great alternative to the higher priced Jewelry Portfolio from Red Envelope. I highly recommend this product as it has all the right pockets, a roll for your rings and a perforated strip for all your post earrings. <end>  Great Product  Ordered 4 of these as bridesmaid gifts. They are beautiful and practical with zippered pockets and even holes to hang earrings. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice travel jewelry roll. <end>  jewelry roll by lewis N. Clark  The item was not as pictured. It is funky and of poor quality. The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this. <end>
 B00024VR9M  Sterling Silver Mezuzah Pendant w/ no parchment, 2 inch (51 mm) long ||	  It Is - what it is  The beauty and simplicity of this necklace has been very satisfying. It has maintained it's beauty for 3yrs. No you can not put an entire scroll but I did get the words "Shema" Deu 6 4-9 on a piece of 3X5 card and stuffed it in there...Oh well. The Price was the best for what I could find at the time. Now there are many other Mezuzah charms available and this one is too expensive for the market. <end>  Excellent necklace, but overpriced now  I bought this necklace back in 2006 and have worn it everyday ever since. I've wanted to get a replacement because I've accidentally messed it up while trying to clean it. However, the price shot up from being 24 bucks to over 60. I have no idea what these people are thinking, but since they don't even provide a chain anymore (they did back when I bought it!) this isn't a good deal unless the price goes down. <end>
 B00025O4VE  Amazon.com  Snow Globe Ring Size 6.5  Clothing ||	  loved but defective  I love this ring and have been wearing one for almost a decade, this is the thrid one i've purchased, all drom different vendors. So when my last one broke i was pretty thrilled to find another one so easily. But i have to say that the dealer hasn't been very responsive. Just two days after getting the ring the liquid started to drip out, and now it's completely dry. I've emailed Carolyn but she never responded about replacing this defective product. So buy this ring from another vendor. <end>  Leaked Too  We loved this ring, but it started leaking with a day or so of receipt  -( <end>  Cute, but leaky  I've now worn this ring twice. The first wearing it was all "snow-globey", but after about 3 hours of wearing it the second time, all the liquid leaked out. It's cute & cheap so I'll buy another one, but beware  it's faulty. <end>  loved but defective  I love this ring and have been wearing one for almost a decade, this is the thrid one i've purchased, all drom different vendors.

 B0002601YC  Earcuff 9SQLSS Sterling Silver for Left Ear ||	  Love'it!  Simply put, this a a lovely product that isn't too flashy yet very attractive! Bought this as a gift and wasn't disappointed for the purchase. Defiantly recommend this for ladies who have an Industrial bar in the Right Ear, along with a few piercings in both ears, especially if your looking for something to bring balance without adding a long wait on healing for a cartilage piercing. <end>  awesomeness!

 B000279C8M  Tommaso Design(tm) 8x6mm Octagon Emerald Cut Genuine Aquamarine Pendant in 14 kt White Gold ||	  Beautifully presented  I ordered the pendant with trepidation since I like to be able to "see" what I buy. The picture convinced me to purchase it however. It was boxed very well; shipped immediately BUT the pendant was almost colorless. It was MUCH paler than shown and the chain on which it is pictured is not the one I received though it was acceptable. I am pleased but more clarification would have been appreciated. <end>  Aquamarine Emerald Cut Pendant from Fine Jewelers  I have ordered several items through Amazon.com from FineJewelers and each have two excellent reasons for continuing to do so  Price and Quality. An additional plus is the excellent product review visually and descriptive on the Amazon.com site combined with safe speedy ordering. <end>  1.50cttw Genuine Emerald Cut Aquamarine Pendant  I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She said it was extremely beautiful and that it came in a beautiful box and velvet bag. She has not taken this pendant off since she has received it. I just recently seen it upon her visit. I agreed that it is elegant and delicate and very beautiful piece of jewelry. The only thing is   that the pendant looks more clear than Aquamarine next to the body. If you hold it up in the light then you can see the Aquamarine color. Again it is worth the price of this beautiful piece of jewelry.Debbie <end>  emeral cut auqamarine pendant  The necklace is very beautiful - exactly as pictured- also very fast shipping.

 B00027CUR2  Tommaso Design(tm) Genuine 3 Stone and Diamond Mothers Ring LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  Very nice ring for the price  I am completely satisfied with this ring. It has bigger stones and a nicer style than comparably priced rings. If you are looking for a 3-stone mother's ring, this is by far the nicest I found. It came beautifully presented in a wooden ring box and velvet bag!I am impressed and very pleased. <end>  Don't be afraid to order online.  I was, like most people perhaps, a little apprehensive about ordering jewelry online. I read the reviews from other's who purchased this ring and felt a little more confident.I am happy to say that I am very pleased with the total experience from this vendor. The ring isn't "cheap" looking at all. It has some substance to it and the stones they used are very nice indeed. It comes in it's own wooden gift box, inside a plain white box, inside a nice blue velvet bag, nice. It's a beautiful piece of jewelry at a very reasonable price.The staff at finejewelers were easy to work with. Communication was great and the turn around time was excellent! I read that they will call you but I emailed them first. They returned my email very promptly to confirm my stone choices and emailed me when my order shipped. Excellent. Thank you FineJewelers! <end>  MOTHERS RING  THE RING IS EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED, THE FIT IS PERFECT, THE STONES ARE GORGEOUS, AND THE SETS ARE TIGHT.THANK YOU FOR READING THIS REVIEW. <end>  Perfect, just what I have been looking for!  The ring is just beautiful, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Thanks so much! Love it!!!!! <end>  overall a positive experience  I too was skeptical about purchasing jewelry online. However, I also struggled to find a substantial mothers ring anywhere at a reasonable price so I gave it a shot. The ordering process was easy and the ring came very quickly. In general, I am happy with the experience. The stones are a nice size. One of the stones is set crooked so I will have to have it re-set since I don't have time to send it back to the company before I give it to my mom for her birthday. Overall, I don't think you can do better at this price point for the size of the stones, the fact that they are genuine, and that it has real diamonds. <end>  Excellent Mother's Ring  I absolutely loved this ring and received it VERY quickly. Most jewelry stores take weeks to deliver a ring like this. Not to mention the prices are ridiculous and most are only 10kt gold with synthetic stones. I would recommend this ring to anyone! My mother absolutely loved it and how unique it is from most Mother's rings. I'm a very satisfied customer! <end>  Very happy  Absolutely satisfied. Also, if you're wondering how you pick the stones after you place the order they email you asking for your stone choices. That confused me at time of order. <end>  Mother's Ring  A beautiful piece of jewelry. Quality product and responsive customer service. My wife really appreciates it as a gift. Thank you. <end>  Great company  It is lovely, it has not been off my finger since I received it.It is actually more beautiful on my finger than on the page.Very nice professional establishment to work with.Thank you. <end>  Superfast, and beautiful quality  Turnaround in under a week! Super quality! Thanks so much!!!! <end>

 B00027E7J6  Karina B(tm) Genuine Sapphire Band LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  Beautiful ring  I received this as a gift from my husband (after much hint-dropping) and could not be more pleased. The quality of the stones is excellent  the deep blue of the sapphires is perfectly offset by the bright diamonds. According to my husband, the ordering process was very easy and the ring was easily returnable (that is, if the price tag was not removed). My setting is in white gold, which has retained its color and has stayed shiny since I received it about 8 months ago. Highly recommended. <end>

However, the ring was smaller than pictured, not mentioning the 0.2 carat stone as stated in description but the band is really thin. I am near 5'2 asian but my sis still thought it's a bit tinny. The pictures shown could be a smaller size with thicker band. Mine is a 6. <end>

 B00027LUIW  14K White Gold Oval Genuine Opal Filligree Ring ||	  --- 5 Year review --- Still a great ring after stone replacement  It is a very nice looking opal ring that is not too small or too gaudy. I like the fillagree style and colorful stone. The diamonds are too small to really make a fuss over, but does give a nice sparkle touch.I ended up getting a full size too large, which may have helped me because the band is really thin, and making it smaller I beleive thickened it.Overall I am very pleased, the jeweler complimented on it and I dont think he would have guessed it was at this price.--- 5 year review ----The ring is still worn from my then girlfriend to my now wife, whis was only a birthday ring at the time and she still wears it. The gold has held up very well, no need to re-plate it yet but the opal unfortunately popped out at the "two-can" house at Litchfield beach couple years ago and we replaced it with a sapphire. the fittings were still tight so I assume the opal fractured and fell out. I learned that opals are a soft stone and can fall out or break more easily than other harder stones.5 stars, opals can break.. ring still great. <end>  Colorful opal  This ring gets mixed review from me. The opal does have nice color and seems to be of decent quality. The filligree is nice and adds to the visual appeal. As noted by other reviewers, the diamonds are small but nicely frame the opal. Unlike another review, the band on the ring I got wasn't thin and seems to be nice. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the opal/set. The ad made it look bigger. It is still a pretty ring but expected a bit larger stone. <end>

 B00027VU46  14K Yellow Gold Emerald-cut Genuine Garnet Men's Ring ||	  looks nice, not the best quality.  The ring actually looks nice, but the picture is a little misleading.

I'm considering returning this. <end>

 B00027VWV2  14K White Gold Emerald-cut Genuine Opal Men's Men's Ring ||	  Enjoyed the ring at first, However.......  I've selected this ring for the beauty shown on display on Amazon. The Opal stone does NOT look like the picture. It's more opaque looking than anything. After a few months of wearing the ring the corners of the stone chipped away and are now loose inside the ring ready to fall out. I would not recommend this ring. <end>
 B00027WH6Q  14K White Gold Round Genuine Aquamarine Men's Men's Ring ||	  It's Ok, but don't expect any weight  This is a nice ring, but do not expect it to feel like it is on your finger.

 B00027WH8O  14K Yellow Gold Round Genuine Amethyst Men's Men's Ring ||	  Should be better  This ring is a nice piece only due to the fact that the Amethyst is a red-flash, "Siberian" stone, and is natural. The diamonds have a pretty good cut and are OK for what they are. The amethyst suffers due to a very poor cut. The table is much too large and none of the meet-points of the facets are even near correct. The critical angle required for maximum fire and color was lost because of these factors.The setting (finding) has a nice appearance but is hollow cast. This was not evident in photograph published.Overall, one can say "good" but, for the price the quality should have been much better. <end>

 B000289U9C  Tommaso Design(tm) Genuine Emerald and Diamond Ring in 14 kt White Gold Size 7 ||	  A nervous buy that worked out great  This was my first jewlery purchase online. I bought this ring as a wedding gift. Shipping was very quick. Upon arrival I opened it and was very pleased. My wife loves it and emerald happens to be her birthstone. Remember that your created stones will be a much clearer prettier stone but I think they look too good and fake. Really, what woman doesn't want the real thing and this is a great value. <end>  amazing engagement ring!  My fiancee gave me this ring for our engagement! The color of the emerald is exquisite, with no cloudy spots. The diamonds are small, but give it a nice sparkle without taking away from the elegance of the emerald. Very luxurious, small ring which works well for an engagement ring because it is comfortable enough to wear all day long. This ring is exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased with it! The shipping was fast and the service was wonderful, as well! <end>
 B00028CVX4  Karina B(tm) Genuine Sapphire Band LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  Beautiful ring  I received this as a gift from my husband (after much hint-dropping) and could not be more pleased. The quality of the stones is excellent  the deep blue of the sapphires is perfectly offset by the bright diamonds. According to my husband, the ordering process was very easy and the ring was easily returnable (that is, if the price tag was not removed). My setting is in white gold, which has retained its color and has stayed shiny since I received it about 8 months ago.

 B00028DP7A  2mm Sterling Silver Diamond-Cut Square Magic Snake Chain Necklace 30" Length ||	  sturdy jewellry  This is the second one of these I've had, and I like it. It's strong enough to hold heavy pendants and it also looks good enough to hold large pendants - its the right proportion. I put smaller pendants on thinner chains. If you want something to stand out, its this. <end>  Silver chain  I ordered this chain to wear with a new pendant. Nice sparkle, nice chain. <end>
 B00028MCF6  Pearl Diamond Pendant ||	  So sweet, gorgeous and innocent looking  I ordered this necklace as a birthday present for my 18-year old cousin. I was looking for something really small and "innocent" looking. And I've found just that. The picture show here doesn't do the necklace justice. It is really beautiful, with a really thin and smooth golden chain. The pearls are very lustrous, but the diamond is not the whole "dot" that you see in the picture here. It is surrounded by white gold(?) metal accents to look bigger, but is still very attractive. Combined with the matching earrings, this is a perfect addition for anyone, especially those who are looking for small, not "yelling-at-you" jewelry. <end>  Great price for a great quality!!  I just bought 3 necklace for my nieces and i couldn't be happier! The pearls are all prefect and the whole necklace is very well made. The diamond is tiny, but still very nice! It's a prefect gift and I think a wonderful buy! <end>  Love this pendant!  I am so happy with this purchase-the pearls are beautiful and the chain is easy to put on.I really like the choices given in the lenght of the chain.I'll be back! <end>

I purchased this ring from Kay jeweler for $400 about a year ago, it was my engagement ring. I didn't want anything large that would snag on a sweater or clack against hard surfaces... Just recently I bought a 3 stone ring to fuse with this one. It is 1/2 carat middle sapphire and 1/4 carat total diamonds on either side. It looks great together and definitely one of a kind. <end>

I never take them out. <end>  ....  item was not what i expected at all....it is slightly bigger and the quality is not all that great. i didn't like how it bends because that means it's easily breakable.

It was a great match to the Tanzanite ring my wife has. Shipping was very fast and the packaging was very professional. This was a Mothers Day gift and my wife loved it. <end>  Nice earrings  Only problem is all the branding on all the stuff. It would be much nicer if finejewelers wasn't on the bag, box, and then on the inside of the jewlry box. <end>  lost already...  -(  I bought the earrings for my wife for our anniversary. They came in the mail very quickly. She had them for three days. Then one of them fell out. She doesn't know exactly when and where, but one is gone. The back, she tells me, does not clip on too strongly, so they fall out quite easily. They are beautiful for sure, but to lose one only after three days was quite dissapointing. <end>

 B0002C76SU  Tommaso Design(tm) Genuine Aquamarine and Diamond 3 Stone Ring LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  Perfect!  My husband gave me this ring first as a promise ring while we were dating, and I loved it so much that it has continued on as my engagement ring and now wedding ring. It is absolutely beautiful and a fantastic deal for the price! We had looked long and hard for a ring with my birthstone and it is just too perfect for me to part with it. The stones are larger than I expected and as long as you clean the stones occasionally (I rarely do) the blue is absolutely stunning. If we had to, we would make the purchase all over again and I would recommend it to anyone. <end>
 B0002C77G6  Tommaso Design(tm) Oval 7x5mm Genuine Tanzanite and Diamond Ring LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  Good stone, but bad band  Received the ring in a timely manner.The stone is lighter and more purple than the blue shown in the picture, but very pretty nontheless. I have not had it appraised and checked by my local jeweler yet, so cannot speak to the quality of the stone. To my ametuer eye, it is satisfying.However, the craftsman work on the band was the crudest I've ever seen. Not sure if it is due to the re-sizing, but I've had rings re-sized before and none came back asymmetrical. <end>

 B0002C81BQ  Freshwater Cultured Potato Pearl 9.0-10.0mm Necklace, 17", and 9.0-9.5mm Stud Earring Set ||	  Nice gift.  I really liked the pearl necklace, it's nice and affordable. If you're looking for the finest pearls or are a pearl expert, well, I'd advise you to seek a specialized jewelry store but if you're just browsing for a nice affordable gift, this is the right place. I like the necklace and earrings and the look pretty well on my girlfriend. Thanks!. <end>  Gorgeous Pearl Set!  These are gorgeous! They are heavy weight and have the look and feel of a much more expensive set. I am not an expert but have worn and owned cheap imitations and these are the real deal and look it. I highly recommend this as a lovely set if you like pearls or even if you are an expert with pearls, you will enjoy them. They have minor blemishes and that makes them unique and real and those are not that noticeable. A great bargain.! <end>  Made my mother happy!  Bought a set for my mother, and she loved them. Perfect present. <end>  Wife Loves These Pearls!  Wife of 17 years all smiles with this gift. Lots of compliments. Great gift for under $50! <end>  Beautiful  The length of necklace and size and luster of the pearls is just perfect. The earrings are classic. Beautifully packaged for gift giving, and reasonably priced. Every girl should have a set of pearls! <end>  Great Gift at affordable price  Amazing gift and comes in cute pouch.It is really heavy and Looks like an expensive gift. <end>  Great product!  This was a present for my wife and she absolutely loved it. I like the potato shaped pearls, too - pretty cool. <end>  Amazing necklace!  I love this necklace which was purchased as a gift because its pearls look very beautiful- even color and luster. Recommend it. <end>  Fabulousity!  My husband bought these as a wedding gift for me. They are beautiful, heavy, and lustrous. You will be amazed at what you get for the money. I was skeptical, but they are gorgeous! <end>  Beautiful!  These pearls are beautiful! They aren't perfectly smooth or round, but they have a great shine to them and they feel heavy in a good way. The pearls are an ivory color. I am very happy with them! <end>  Sister loved them  I never saw them to be able to respond to specific criticisms, but my sister loved them and that's the most important thing for me. She thought they were a lot more expensive than they were, so I guess that means it's a great value, too. <end>  Very nice, wife was pleased  Very nice, product as described. My wife likes them and you can't beat the price. <end>  Bible code  This is a great one of a kind product from a respected company. The international shipping was reasonably fast. I would like to do business with this company again, Thanks. hjh <end>  Just got it....awesome present  needed to get a present for my woman for christmas...this was a greeaaaat idea. It was mad heavy and inexpensive. the pearls are great! i would buy them again. <end>  Great for the price  It is a nice piece of jewlery. Pearls are not too big but not too small either. The clasp is a bit tricky and feels quite flimsy. My girl friend loves it and has gotten many compliments but she can't wear without someone's help. Over all great for the price. <end>  VERY heavy pearls  For the price, I got what I paid for. VERY heavy odd shaped pearls but once on the neck the look great with heft !!!!! These make a great gift !! <end>  Great Set at a Great Price  I recently ordered these on the Lightning Deal and my girlfriend loves them. Granted I'm not familiar with other sets of pearls, but they have a great look and feel to them. The earrings seemed a little big, but not too bad. I'd recommend this to anyone, especially younger people looking to get their first set of pearls, as I can't speak for anything in a more expensive range. <end>  Good buy  This set is very nice and worth every penny of the price.One thing I am not quite happy is that the clasp couldn't latch. I can still wear it but people could see the open clasp if I don't put my hair down. I feel bad for that because the pearls are so pretty! I wish they have better quality claspes. <end>  Great...esp. for the price!  I bought these for my bridesmaids and they are perfect. Nice size pearls, pretty color, and the price was the best part! Sure they are not perfect, but for $45 - they are better than I could have hoped for! <end>  Better than a bargain  I admit I don't know a whole lot about jewelery, luckily it wasn't a diamond, but using some of the previous reviews helped me to finally decided on this set. My wife really like them, love? I don't suppose but that's what diamonds are for I guess. They have that weight to them that I've been told is important and they look really great on my wife. She's gotten numerous compliments so I guess I must of done good. <end>  Excellent Value for a very Happy Shopper  I know the difference between akoya (round, perfect) and freshwater (potato-shaped, irregular) pearls. I purchased this SET (necklace and earrings!) hoping to get a decent set of pearls  I underestimated Amazon.com. They knocked the ball over the wall on this set (earrings & necklace for the price !)Weight  Necklace  HEFTY. You feel this baby in your hands. Hand-knotted, gorgeous clasp.Earrings  You will see them on your ears girls!Color  Soft ivory &gt; white. A sheen on them that notes them as real.Surface  As in freshwaters, irregular. They are quite perfect and large in size (very unusual to find anything beyond teensy) for freshwaters.I've purchased a 2d set for my niece who just went off to college. I'm now thinking I should doublecheck my Holiday list too.This is a gorgeous set, arrives in a nice dark blue velvet pouch. Am certain this will bring a big twinkle to my eye for years to come. <end>  I did good  I was a little concerned ordering something as a gift for my wife called, &quot;Potato Pearl Necklace.&quot; But I wasn't concerned after it arrived at work and I showed it around the office. No one I showed it to could believe how much I payed and after they found out what the offial amazon name was, a number of them ran back to their cubes to order it themselves. Bigger success at home. My wife thought they were great, hefty weight to the strand, feels like it must cost more, and the she wore them to work the next day where she was a hit. I'm terrible at jewelry and saw a review on this and thought I'd check it out. I did good, and only $30 <end>  Simply fabulous!  Wow - This necklace and earring set is a tremendous value for the price. They are simply beautiful! I've received many compliments on their unique look and luminosity. This set would make a terrific gift - No one would ever guess the price, and I'm certainly not telling. How do they do it? I am extremely pleased. <end>  Buyers Luck?  I own two sets of these pearls and I am hoping to return the second set. The first set was great, but virtually every pearl on the second necklace has a deep ridge which bisects the pearl. It almost looks as if a poorly made miniature plastic Easter egg was put in an oyster for a short while to develop a thin nacre. I was hoping to give this set as a gift and am disappointed. <end>  Great gift, great value  Based on the strength of the other reviews, I bought these for our babysitter, who wants to start a more adult collection of jewlery. When they arrived and we looked at them, my husband looked at me incredulously and asked, "And you're really going to give these to her when you could keep them for yourself?" We did give them to her, but I suspect I may see a set in the near future from my husband, who was clearly impressed with the quality and value. They look far richer and distinct than the image shown, and the weight is solid. The velvet pouch and included care instructions are also nice touches. <end>  What a Deal!  These are &quot;Big Fat Pearls&quot; for an incredible price! The &quot;lumpy&quot; shape is what makes them inexpensive but it also what makes me like them. They can be worn more casually than a traditional string of pearls, i.e. with jeans, etc.They have a &quot;natural-artsy&quot; look to them, akin to the designs you see in &quot;SUNDANCE&quot; catalog but for a fraction of a fraction of the price (not a typo!!).I'm considering buying a set for each of my sisters. They are quite beautiful.I give them a 2 thumbs &quot;way up&quot;. <end>  Big bang for the buck  I've a passion for pearls, have learned much about them and own a few strands--including a wonderful 30" strand of Akoyas. Those are my "dress" pearls; not what I'd consider every day jewelry. I saw these, put them on my wish list, and sent a hint to the DH. Received them for Valentine's Day. The irregular (yet well-matched) shapes are casual enough for every day, luster is good, size of the pearls impressive. A local pearl shop sells something similar for about $100. So if you're looking for a wearable set that's not too dressy at a GREAT price, buy these! Nice packaging, too! Very giftable!! <end>  Lives up to its reviews  Reading the previous reviews of this set, I wondered if I had stumbled upon the net's newest urban legend. I bought it anyway, and am happy to say it lives up to its past reviews. This necklace is quite heavy, and has a beautiful lustre. I've had it three days and have already worn it two days to work. The earrings are very well-matched and look great. Can't recommend it enough. <end>  Huge!!!  Not really the seller's fault so I gave 5 stars, but these pearls are huge! Wearing them makes me feel like Wilma in the Flinestones! The earrings are so big that they overwhelmed my earlobes and kind of drooped. Beautiful though and the presentation was nice with the bag and box. I would recommend only if you like huge jewelry. <end>  Best Amizon Purchase ever!!! (and I own over 180 items!!!)  I just received this set yesterday, and to say the least I was shocked! They are HUGE and beautiful. The only down side is that I think people will think they are fake due to their size and uiniformity in size and color. When you look at them on your neck in a mirror you can hardly even tell they are baroque! <end>  Barely Acceptable  I read couples reviews before I made the purchase, and I was disappointed when I pulled it out from the pouch. It might be just the one that was sent to me is not in a good shape, the majority of the pearls are not smooth, distinctive lines across each pearls. <end>  Does not impress the ladies  This was on sale when I bought it and it looked ugly. It was the bug fake pearls that I gave to a date of mine and she hated it. Buy the real stuff. <end>  To Big for me  They were really pretty but to big for me. I returned them <end>  Love this necklace  I was surprised at the size of these pearls when I first opened the box. These are big pearls! Then I put them on and thought "I look like a million bucks". They are absolutely magnificent. A creamy white color with a beautiful glow, weighty but extremely comfortable, cool at first then they warm to your body temperature, and the most perfect length. This strand of pearls looks stunning with a winter-white or black top, but i'll be wearing them with everything. <end>  Lovely Wedding Gift  These pearls were beautiful, I purchased them for my bridesmaids to wear at my wedding with their rust-colored dresses and they were absolutley beautiful. The pearls were slightly flawed and uneven but nothing very noticable. They had a great luster and looked very natural. The biggest problem was I ordered 3 and couldn't get a 4th. Disappointing! Other then that they were a great purchase, I was impressed. <end>  A Great Treat at a GREAT bargain! Double bonus!  Buying jewelry online is a hit or miss, and I wasn't expecting much at the great price during a gold box promo. Also, I tend to be on the pickier side.When I first got this, at first touch it felt nice and cool in the hand as all pearls does and should; the weight was very substantial, and the earrings, a little flatter than round was well made.However, boy did I STRUGGLE with the clasp! And usually I have no issues with fishhook clasp. I literally played with it for at least 30mins, as I was trying hard not to put any strain on the delicate strand. However, once I figured it out, it's pretty easy now and I can easily get it on and off.The pearls themself has a nice sheen to them, is a creamy white color and is pretty uniform in size. However, there are blemishes, but I like that as it makes it more unique. (I also have a few other strands, one being from over seas given as a gift from a soldier when he was there that was very costly, but unfortunately, the strand broke and I've been procrastinating to get them restrung.) The blemishes are 'natural' looking and not the fake plastic looking flaws some pearls have, and at a distant, you can't really see they're baroque.I'm only 5' barely weighing in the triple digits and am 27 years old, so these are pretty big on me, but I like unique big bold jewelry, and this definitely screams that, and that's not really something someone says about pearls! So I'm very pleased. The 17" is very nice! I love the length! It's just perfect! Since the pearls are so big in size and heavy in weight, 16" would given me that 'suffocating' feeling which I can't stand for more than say an hour, and 18" would be wayyyyy to big for this type of jewelry on me. So this sits perfectly on my neckline. However, my mother, who is 62 and a bit on the heavier side, did not appreciate the length at all. So be weary with that. That being said, it looks great with all types of shirts such as boat, crew neck, v-neck etc. Also, the color and sheen to it looks wonderful with any color combination! These can be dressed up or worn casually. I can pull this off with jeans and a nice shirt, but would have no problems wearing this with a dressier outfit. (However, usually when I'm really dressed up, I tend to go for diamonds...but that's just me =)The earrings are very BIG! So big that when I wear them, I have to take out my second piercing, otherwise both earrings would be smushed together. Then again, pearls look classier by themself, then with all my earrings in my ears. (I have a total of 7 ear piercings, 4 on my left, and 3 on my right, and 3 of them are cartiledge piercings.) Like I said above, the pearls on the earrings are 'flatter' but that's also a good thing as it doesnt sit too high up on your ears, but just perfect since it doesnt get in the way or feel uncomfy. These earrings are also well made; no glue or nothing to be seen!All in all, these were a real bargain for the price! I would have been happy with just the necklace, so I view the earrings as an added bonus. I would NOT be surprised if I saw just the earrings alone for the price I paid, as this set is realy well made.I am very happy with this item and will definitely recommend! However, I wouldn't purchase this for anyone I know...just because I like to be the only one with pearls this big and awesome looking! lol j/k...kind of.ETA  If these ever go back down to the sale price I bought it for, I am DEFINITELY going to pick up at least another set or two, just in case something happens to this one. I wore it earlier with a black cowl neck shirt, and the pearls looked dazzling and just the perfect length! <end>  Stunning- both in appearance and in price  I've been looking for a set of inexpensive pearls for formal occasions for a while. Since I'm a college student making no money right now, I'm on a pretty tight budget. I found this pearl set on Amazon and read all the glowing reviews, and decided to go for it. The pictures on here do not do the pearls justice. They look about 20 times more expensive than they actually cost. True, there are flaws such as ridges and small flecks, but they are not visible unless you hold the pearls really close to your face. The flaws do not detract from the beautiful shine and smoothness of the pearls at all. The pearls on the necklace are huge, shine beautifully, and very uniform. As beautiful as the necklace is, it's the pair of button pearl earrings that I wear everyday. They go with everything I wear (even jeans and sweatshirts) and on days when I wake up with only 3 hours of sleep, putting the earrings on makes me feel awake and put-together. If you are hesitating about this set, definitely go for it. It's inexpensive, but quietly elegant and so classy. Treat yourself with this stunning set! <end>  Tres Chic!!!  Very nice size, almost perfect shape, beautiful luster and color. Great to wear with almost anything. They are very chic and classy. I'm very happy I bought them!!! <end>  beautiful but tough to work  Lovely jewelry, great price, but the clasp is pretty tough to work. This is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers. I'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. It's probably a great choice for very occassional use, though with the quality and price, it really is a regular-use type of necklace. I think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered, traditional-fashion person. <end>  Potato Pearl Review  This is a beautiful matched set. Unfortunately, the pearl strand was too short and had to be returned. This would be a very fine gift for a young girl; or, small women. <end>  Beautiful Freshwater Pearls  I had always assumed that freshwater pearls were oddly shaped and not as attractive as their saltwater cousins. This set put my assumptions to rest. It is a beautiful set of pearls at a very competetive price. <end>  Great gift!  I just got this set for xmas. The pearls are very beautiful, very well matched, and the baroque look is very flattering, even though they look near-perfect.Don't be fooled by the picture- these are BIG! You can definitely feel them on your neck.A great gift for any girl! <end>  My Wife Loved Them  I was a little worried when I purchased these that the pearls might be different sizes, or because the price was so low that the quality would not be there. My wife absolutely loved them. She was speechless, and when I first saw them, I loved them too. They go great with my wife's wedding dress. She may not even wear the earrings, but just the necklace is worth is for the price.I would easy recommend these to EVERYONE who is in the market for pearls. They are great (and the price was even better). <end>  Freshwater Potato Pear  Great product for the price, espeacially for a starter set. Fear not, you cant go wrong here... <end>  Good Stuff  I odered this for my friend and she loved them the second she got them and they came right on time and they gave her this really pretty case that she uses to store them in. They look real and the earing and necklace together buy is a really good offer that i wouldnt pass up. <end>  Smart Idea  If you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and don't really have a good frame of referance - these are for you. My wife was a jewler and she likes pearls. I bought these and got positive feedback. I was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great. You will be OK if you go with these. <end>  Nice Pearls!!  These pearls are well matched in both size and colour. They are elegantly packaged. The size is rather large for younger ladies or those who are petite. I wish the set had a matching bracelet!!! I have been quite pleased and am complimented each time I wear them. <end>  a wonderful purchase  I bought these pearls for a best friend who had wanted pearls forever, but had never gotten a pair. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the pearls. They were beautiful and for a great price. She was extremely thrilled with them. <end>  a good buy  The necklace and stud earrings are of good quality. I found the clasp tricky, but manageable. <end>  Pearls for Mum  I ordered this gift for my mother in law for her birthday, the pearls were beautiful and of great quality. The service that we recieved was outstanding and I would definately order from amazon again. I am currently shopping on the site and considering a set of the pearls for myself, they go great with any outfit! <end>  The Perfect Gift  These pearls are really great! They are the perfect gift for any occasion. They look even better out of the box than they do on these pictures. A Great Buy! <end>  okay but not great  I read the reviews and decided to try it out. Perhaps my expectation was a bit too high...The earing set is terrific, beautiful pearls, perfect uniformity -- only that I don't wear earings...I bought the set solely for the necklace, and the necklace didn't meet my expectations. Almost all pearls have lines/ridges across across them. Low/medium luster. Disappointed. Anyhow, I love pearls, so for the price it's still worth it, I think. I'm keeping it, and, given all the reviews, I may try my luck again sometime later. <end>  QUALITY NOT CONSTANT in this necklace  I purchased one of these sets and liked it so much that I ordered a second one for a gift a few months later; it was also quite beautiful, hefty, substantial, with good lustre and fairly similar potato pearls. Then I thought of buying two more and having them re-knotted to make them into ONE long necklace, but now that I received them, one is as nice as usual, BUT the other one is horrible, with pearls of quite different shapes, qualities and sizes -not graduated, either-, asymmetric, with their perforations off-centered, impossible to turn into ONE longer one. Too bad I don't live in the U.S. otherwise I would most certainly return the defective one. <end>  I love this set  This is a stunningly beautiful earring and necklace set! Pearls look excellent next to bare skin, and this sets off whatever you are wearing. The slightly odd shapes of the pearls are quite interesting, giving the jewelry a more natural look. The man who gave me this set earned a great big thank-you! I love this set, and wear it every chance I get.(Review of Freshwater Cultured Potato Pearl 9.0-10.0mm Necklace, 17", and 9.0-9.5mm Stud Earring Set) <end>  real authentic look and feel  I bought these for my wife on Valentines day. Sadly she was in the hospital for a surgery and came back home on Valentine's day, and when I gave her this gift - her smile made my day.She was floored by the pearl string - flat out. The weight and feel of the real odd shaped pearls is really flattering on a womans neckline. The "potato" oddness of the imperfect round shape adds more authenticity to the individual pearls.A very good buy for the value.At least for me, who never can tell a perl from a similarly glistening worthless stone, this string of pearls and the ear buds made my wife wonder how could I have selected such a nice choice... <end>  Decently satisfied  I ordered this set for myself because of the amazing reviews I had seen. I am not a jewelry expert, however, I was somewhat dissapointed with the quality. The earrings would be absolutely fabulous but one of them has a large blemish right on the front and a deep ridge in it above the stud. The necklace looks fantastic from a distance! Although when you look at it from less than two feet away, you start to notice the ridges and blemishes in it. I think that the clasp is absolutely terrible! It is almost impossible to use with fingernails and I could only imagine the difficulties that I would have if I was an elderly woman. I would recommend buying this for everyday wear and not for an event that you would really want to stand out at. I am keeping my set, and I would recommend these to anyone that wants a decent set of pearls at great price. I would not recommend these for anyone who is looking to knock some socks off. <end>  These Pearls are Amazing!!!  I have to admit, I was skeptical of all of these 5 star reviews, but they really deserve the high ratings! These pearls are huge!! They have very mild flaws and abnormalities which are barely noticable. This is an amazing deal and I really recommend these pearls. They would make a lovely gift (or a gift to yourself).I am considering wearing these at my wedding next year... They look nice enough to wear with formal dresses. The earrings are lovely too by themselves and I'm looking forward to wearing them with jeans and casual wear. Couldn't be happier!Only drawback - they are a quite heavy after wearing them for a while!Overall - these are great! Guys - get these for your lady, she will love them!! <end>  Birthday Gift for Mom  I bought the set as a birthday gift for my mom. This year instead of sending flowers I wanted to send something a bit more lasting and I have to say that they went over very very well. My mom was extremely pleased and impressed. The price of the set was a bargain for the reaction they recieved. Also I ordered them on 1/30 and they got to my mom on 2/1 which is fast. All in all very worth my money and both my mom and I are very pleased. <end>  Good Value  This necklace has a high luster because of its large size of pearl. And they look beautiful on the neck although they are not that round, because they are shiny and have a pretty good uniform. 29$ is a good price. <end>  Awesome !  I gifted this set to my aunt in US and she absolutely loves it ! Looks like a great deal for the price you pay. Thanks Amazon ! <end>  Better than expected  I would by a half dozen sets of these pearls if they were at the lightning deal price again. Even at the $45 price tag, they are a great buy for a lovely set of nicely strung, well matched, almost graduated pearls of a huge size. I was concerned that the strand might be too short at 17", but it is perfect due to the 9-10mm size of beautiful baroque pearls. I haven't even taken the earrings out of the bag yet because I'm too excited about the strand around my neck. If you are looking for perfectly round blemish-free pearls, this is not the set for you. If you enjoy irregularity in shape and savor the idea that each pearl has been formed individually and is strung so that it is protected from the adjoining pearls by a nice knot, then this strand is for you. Because I have many pearl earrings, I likely will present the earrings that do match the strand in color and luster as a gift so that someone else can share in their beauty. People have criticized the clasp but I have no problem at all with it since I'm familiar with the style. It's construction actually acts as a double safety since if it opens, the hook will keep it around your neck and not on the floor. On my strand, one of the two largest pearls that are at the center of the strand is the most malformed and that's the one I enjoy the most. I can roll it so that it shows or have it against my skin. One more thing, these look great on camera. <end>  Great Buy  I bought this set for part of my fiancee's Christmas, and she loves it! The pearls are a very nice size. They really are heavy and shine beautifully. They are definitely worth the price! <end>  Made a memorable Valentine's Day for my 16 YO  I got these for my daughter for Valentine's Day, thinking when she's loses them I will have only lost $29...They are beautiful, striking and made her day. They are a great value, a highly recommended purchase. <end>

Nice stone set in quality gold. I got exactly what I was looking for. <end>  Beautiful earrings  The earrings are beautiful, well made, look like real diamonds. My only complaint is that the backs are a bit loose. But those can be replaced. <end>  Bait and switch  I noticed while looking at a different item that this and other pieces offered by this seller in the product's name advertise that the piece is Zircon... It is not! It is Cubic Zirconia!CZ (cubic zirconia) is a man made diamond simulant. Zircon is a natural stone. They are not the same.It is against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines for the jewelry industry to sell a simulant as any natural stone or under the name of a different stone.[...]Zircon is the mineral zirconium silicate ZrSiO4I can't tell you if the CZ or the setting are any good but I can tell you I don't trust a seller that repeatedly uses false advertisement. <end>

 B0002D9DH6  Ladies Ruby and Diamond Ring ||	  A wonderful ring  At first when i got the ring, it seemed a little small, but when i gave it to my girlfriend, she absolutely loved it. She told me, that she doesn't like big rings, and that one was perfect. She wears everyday now because she says it's her lucky ring. Im glad i picked it... <end>
 B0002D9Q5U  2.4MM 14kt Gold Flat Diamond Curb Necklace ||	  Great value for what you get  I had a hard time finding an affordable curb chain that wasn't too chunky with the right design. Most of the smaller chains seemed overpriced for their size, or look bad. I looked around for a long time at jewelers and other websites, and this is the best deal I found. The seller delivered the item overnight (which was impressive to me), and I received the item about three days after placing the order. The item is exactly as advertised and even better in person than I imagined. I would definitely buy again from this seller. <end>

 B0002E1POE  18" Braided Leather Necklace with Simulated Onyx ||	  nice product, but it needs a better clasp  I do really like this necklace. It is very attractive and goes with so many things. The only problem is that I have to be very careful of it because the clasp comes undone very easily. It comes off practically every time I lift off a scarf, for example. <end>
 B0002E1PRQ  7" Braided Leather Bracelet with Simulated Turquoise ||	  Garbage!  This purchase was my most disappointing purchase ever! It's not Sterling Silver and it's Chinese Turquoise. It's also not real leather. So it's worth about $5 and is selling for 5 times that much. I do NOT recommend this product! <end>

I've received lots of compliments and many wanted to know where to get an ankle like this from. <end>  Look so beautiful and sound so enchanting  An anklet can be a sexy addition to your wardrobe, drawing the eye to your footwear, and giving that hint of the exotic. This fun little anklet is silver with an array of little silver bells that jingle with each step. Wear it with dress shoes, sandals or bare feet, and you will be noticed!Ladies, during those intimate moments, when less clothing is the name of the game, jewelry comes into its own, and nice anklets (such as these) are a must. I think that these anklets that look so beautiful and sound so enchanting are great fun, and I highly recommend them!(Review of Sterling Silver Jingle Bells Anklet) <end>  Lovely anklet worth the money  This anklet arrived as pictured marked 925. It tinkles nicely and looks very fashionable on. The seller shipped super fast and packaged it in a cute silver box. Would do business with this seller again. <end>  Lovely!  I ordered 2 of these ankle bracelets and they are lovely. The sound you get from the bells is great! <end>
 B0002E479Y  Sterling Silver Saint Michael Medal 3/4 inch Round Antiqued Finish, Free 24 inch Surgical Steel Chain ||	  St. Michael  The item is exactly as described. I had purchased one several weeks ago from a different vendor and the loop that the chain passes through was so small, that it was barely large enough to pass dental floss through. This pendant is pefect and will fit a nice sized chain. <end>  good value  Good necklace for the price. My teenage son really liked it (although he would have preferred a slightly thicker chain) <end>

 B0002E47JO  Sterling Silver Flawlessly Finished Huggie Earrings Round Shape, 5/8" tall ||	  Beautiful Earrings Wonderfully Made At a Great Price  Buying earrings online is difficult. Unlike rings and bracelets were all you need to know is the size in inches - earrings present a bit of a challenge.One of the most pleasant parts of this purchase was how quickly the seller responded to my questions which were many. I had decided to go with the same style at a half inch but took their recommendation of going a bit larger with a 5/8.They're just beautiful. Solid, gleaming and just the right size. Not to wide, just right.The craftsmanship is outstanding in every way. The hidden hinge opens completely so they're hassle free to put on. The locking mechanism is equally well made and they close with a reassuring click.These earring have a wonderful weight to them and the finish is simply gorgeous - when they say "Flawlessly Finished" I can assure you, that's exactly what they are. The look is elegant and timeless - they don't scream earrings but rather compliment any other pieces you wear, especially silver. The earrings arrive with each one in a sealed zip locked little bag, inside a silver presentation box which is nice enough for gift giving.Shipping was surprisingly fast and well packaged - the little bags are a thoughtful touch because this would prevent them from getting scratched as they bump into on another during transit.Truly unisex as both men and women can wear these in full and total confidence. Plus the huggie style is a refreshing change from the usual hoops.In short - beautiful, high quality earrings at a great price from a very helpful seller.If you're on the fence about them I can assure you you'll be more than pleased. <end>  Beautiful  This is the best buy ever! They are so beautiful and just the right size. <end>

You have to take them off if you want.They fit so comfortably and snug.They are very small as you can see it on my video.Nice for everyday or with other earrings if you have more piercings.If you like simplicity in jewelry, you'll love these earrings,they are a classic.Highly recommended. <end>  Perfect.  Love, love, love these earrings. This is exactly what I was looking for. The thin part of the earring that slips into your pierced hole does not peek out, just the thick part, so it doesn't look awkward. My skin is super sensitive to lesser quality materials, I have had zero issues. Incredibly happy with this item, I haven't taken them out since receiving them. <end>  Great Earrings!  The other posters are right, these earrings rock! They have a snap clasp so you always know when they are securely on. They are also of good quality and are the exact small size I was looking for. <end>

 B0002E50OA  Faceted Oval Citrine Ring (size  8) ||	  It's not nearly as pretty in real life.  The stone is way more yellow and less November birthstone in real life. I never wear it because it's just not that pretty in real life. <end>

At the end of the tour, I reward each guest (but only the attentive listeners) to this pin. They love it, and I love giving it to them.The pin is actually quite small, but it is well made and attractive.The pins came in good condition and at the advertised time (I got them within five days). <end>
 B0002FQBL0  Sterling Silver Mesh Chain Bracelet with Blue Topaz and Heart Shaped Toggle Clasp ||	  Mother's Pleasure  This turned out to be a wonderful gift. I was really pleased with the quality and my Mother was very proud of it. I hasitate to buy jewerly and have it sent directly to my Mother but this was a wonderful surprise and now I will do it again... <end>  Pretty but...  Very pretty and comfortable but the toggle is not a good fit and it falls off my wrist. I have many toggle type bracelts and this is the only one I cannot wear. If it hadn't fallen off where it was noticeable I would have lost it. So now it sits in my jewelry box and cannot be worn. Very disappointing that I will have to pay to have it made to fasten securely or just quit wearing it. Bummer! <end>

 B0002FQCCI  True Sterling Silver Vampires Blood Cross ANKH Charm Pendant ||	  Nice piece of jewelry  I was pretty impressed. It's a very solid piece, thick, with a tiny bit of weight to it so you know it's there when you're wearing it. The ankh itself is approximately 1-inch, not counting the loop/clasp (which seem fairly sturdy.) The loop/clasp are solid, so you'll need to find a chain that will pass through it.The thing I like the most is the design - it's not your conventional ankh. <end>  sterling silver ankh pendant  I love this ankh! The design is like no other I've seen. It just feels good on. It is fairly heavy and of good quality. <end>  Pleasantly pleased with product  I absolutely love this Ankh! I was looking for something unusual that nobody else had and I found it with this piece. The size & weight are perfect for the chain I have and I haven't taken it off since I received it. The price can't be beat, either! <end>

 B0002HFI0I  Magnolia Titanium Wedding Band Set. Choose your Color for Free! ||	  I loved these at first!!!  My husband and I were a week away from getting married and still could not agree on our wedding band set. We came across these and instantly fell in love with them.. I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched.. I thought titanium was the strongest metal and that if wouldn't scratch... The seller is trying to work with us to make us happy.. I guess we'll see. <end>

I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched.. I thought titanium was the strongest metal and that if wouldn't scratch... The seller is trying to work with us to make us happy.. I guess we'll see. <end>

 B0002HHYZU  Una Titanium Band with Black Stripe. Choose your Color for Free! ||	  "Man"gagement Ring  When we got engaged, the future hubby wanted a ring to wear of his own. We looked a lot of places and decided on this one - when I contacted the company they were quick to respond and allowed us to customize our order through amazon. We got this ring but with a blue acrylic inlay stripe. He loves it - and it came quickly. The acrylic will wear out but the company will refill it for the cost of shipping. It's light and it sings when he drops it in the kitchen or on the table - We're definitely happy with it for the price. <end>

 B0002HIJH2  Guru Titanium Ring with Tension Set Garnet ||	  Stylish and strong but not chipped resistant  I bought one of these rings for my husband as an engagement ring. (I asked him, I figured it was only fair.) After four years together he still is very happy with the ring but we now have to replace it. While the strength of the tension has held the stone perfectly the garnet has chipped in 3 places. My husband does not do a lot of manual labor kind of stuff. His job is a software programmer and he never works on cars or other type activities that are rough on jewelery. We will most likely not replace his current ring with the same kind. <end>  Still In Love...with this ring  My husband and I purchased this ring as his wedding band. My husband spent a very long time picking out this ring and he still loves it after 5 years. We purchased the ring from the wonderful people at DiMarco Creations through Amazon. They were wonderful to work with and I will keep them in mind for my future jewelry purchases. The ring is very unique and many people comment on it. The setting is very squared on the sides so it does sometimes catch on things or scratch things if my husband is not paying attention, but this is something we expected due to the shape of the band. We have been very satisfied with the purchase of this ring. <end>

 B0002HIUB2  Mahala Titanium Ring with High Polished Edges ||	  Great Product at a Great Price!  This ring looks just as good on my finger as it does pictured above. I've only had it for a day and already I have received a fistful of compliments. It's elegant but rugged, lightweight, and very comfortable to wear. You'll love it; trust me. <end>  perfect  The ring is very light. It's not as heavy as it looks. The two tone on the ring is perfect, and it complements itself <end>  Good product, but gray band  The ring is nice, but in the picture, the band appears to be black, which is not true. Of course, in dim lighting, the band appears to be somewhat black, but in direct lighting, the band is a light gray. Overall, though, the product is high-quality metal. <end>  Tricky Color  This is a nice ring that my fiance actually wanted to have for his wedding band. It looks darker then it is...its actually light gray in the middle which he didnt really like. Lucky me the store was actually in my city (otherwise you can ship it to them) so i brought it back and they tried to make the middle part as dark as possible. No big difference but it was a little bit more then at first. The ring was a bit to big so we exchanged for a smaller size (no fee for all that)and since i was the one picking it up i actually engraved an inscription on the inside 15$ <end>  Very lightweight  This item looks like it would be a heavyweight metal, when, in fact it is not. It almost has a 'plastic' feel to it. Other than that, the ring looks like the picture. <end>

The ring was a bit to big so we exchanged for a smaller size (no fee for all that)and since i was the one picking it up i actually engraved an inscription on the inside 15$ <end>  Very lightweight  This item looks like it would be a heavyweight metal, when, in fact it is not. It almost has a 'plastic' feel to it. Other than that, the ring looks like the picture. <end>  Great Product at a Great Price!  This ring looks just as good on my finger as it does pictured above. I've only had it for a day and already I have received a fistful of compliments. It's elegant but rugged, lightweight, and very comfortable to wear. You'll love it; trust me. <end>  perfect  The ring is very light. It's not as heavy as it looks. The two tone on the ring is perfect, and it complements itself <end>  Good product, but gray band  The ring is nice, but in the picture, the band appears to be black, which is not true. Of course, in dim lighting, the band appears to be somewhat black, but in direct lighting, the band is a light gray. Overall, though, the product is high-quality metal. <end>  Tricky Color  This is a nice ring that my fiance actually wanted to have for his wedding band. It looks darker then it is...its actually light gray in the middle which he didnt really like.

 B0002HJOUS  Leala Classic Titanium Ring with Grooves ||	  Beautiful ring!  I got this as a surprise gift. I was worried about the sizing, but it fit perfectly and he absolutely loves it.

I assumed that titanium was more durable than gold or silver but I quess not. <end>  One ring to rule them all!  This ring is even more beautiful and distinguished looking than its picture. Be forewarned--titanium CANNOT be sized, so it is imperative that you get sized at a jeweler to make an accurate selection. Seller also shipped item sooner than anticipated.

Only 10 days to get a refund and a 35% restocking fee.

Even more so when I tried to order another and it was no longer available. May be next time. <end>

 B0002IBKJ0  Sterling Silver and Crystal Heart Earrings by Paris Hilton ||	  Good Quality and Style  I had received these earrings for my birthday. They looked cute on the site, but I'm always concerned with the quality of jewelry when purchasing online. However, when I received these, not only did they look amazing, but the quality was very good as well. They were a nice weight. Not the cheapy light weight that you would find in the cheap boutique type stores. I've received so many compliments on these earrings already and I've only worn them once! The nice thing is that you also receive a small pamphlet on how to care for them as well. Very nice and very feminine! <end>  Heart Lover  I wear these earrings EVERY day! They are beautiful....much more so in person. They are worth every penny! <end>  Think in pink  My wife loved the earrings. She liked them because they are pink, and they match everything she uses. She liked the quality too. <end>  Crystal Heart Earrings by Paris Hilton  It's really fit me . I love my new earring!!! <end>  Great earrings/reasonable price  I bought these earrings because I needed something pink... I have gotten loads of compliments on them. I wear them to work and no one has recognized them as a Hilton product.No problems with the crystals and they look really great.I would recommend them for any age wearer.... and I am old enough to know better and young enough to still try!!  -) If there were similar accessories available I would look at purchasing them too.Very pleased with the quality of the items. Thanks Paris. <end>  These are really cute!!!  I just purchased these Pink Heart Paris Hilton earings and I just love them!!!!! The color is perfect, the size is just right, and they glitter and shimmer! Paris has done a wonderful job creating this line of jewelry. I can't wait to buy more of her jewelery!!! These are the perfect earings for any girly girl or princess. <end>  Very nice earrings  Nice Design, looks really charming when put on the ears! Very easy to match casual wear or semi-formal wear, and I think is best wear at nightime especially!!! <end>  Very cheaply made, can't believe it cost so much!  I bought these earrings for my niece recently. As soon as I opened them, I knew I had made a mistake. I should have looked at the pictures better! On most/all of Paris' jewelry, the crystals appear to be glued on, they are NOT set with prongs. This means the crystals will inevitably fall out at some point, and from some of the reviews of her other jewelry pieces, they sometimes ARRIVE with crystals missing.The fact that this so cheaply made would not bother me, if it weren't for the ridiculous prices of her items. These earrings should cost twenty bucks AT MOST. But for $40, I expect not the best quality, but at least decent quality!They are very cute, I like the design. However I just can't get over how this cheap crap is getting priced so high, and this is one of her "cheaper" pieces. Do not buy unless you have money to burn and don't care that they will start to fall apart in a few months, if not sooner. <end>  The GF loves them  Bought these for my girlfriends 23rd birthday. She loved them! Very pink and sparkley <end>  Prettier in person  These earrings are even prettier in person. They really shine and sparkle. They are a nice weight. Very high quality. Good value. Thanks, Paris! Now, pleae design a bracelet and necklace to match them!!! <end>  Paris is in the Pink  I got these earrings and am very pleased with them. There are exactly as stated and pictured. They are very pretty and I love to wear them. Paris did a good job with these. I would like to see a necklace to match these earrings. <end>  PRETTY IN PINK  When these earings arrived this week I was more then happy withthem, they are two beautiful shades of pink crystals, and let meassure you they shine. Paris has really done an amazing job.They are very comfortable as well.If she makes a matching necklace I will buy it.Thanks Paris, they are hot Thanks Amazon.Com <end>  Beautiful!!!!  These earrings are really pretty and I received many compliments after wearing them. The crystals also seem ok and have not come off as many people have mentioned in other reviews. It is pink and very girlie but not very showy and overall it is cute. Hats off to Paris Hilton for doing such a wonderful job with the earrings! <end>  Adorable!  I got these earrings a few months ago, granted I've only worn them twice thus far (just because I have so many different pairs of earrings), but I absolutely adore them. They're not too heavy and they're so shiny. I love them! <end>  Paris Hilton's Puffed Heart Earrings ~ It's a little glitz and glamour yet feminity  First of all, I am totally amazed by Amazon! I did not know that I would find jewelry being offered by Amazon and that I could get free shipping for my orders over $25.00! What a wonderful incentive to buy here. And, I was duly impressed by the speed with which my order arrived.These beautiful earrings are so precious in person. They are beautiful enough to give as a gift. Especially considering that they come with a signed certificate, blue pouch plus pretty box.Amazon is super! <end>  Love paris & collection!!!!!  OMG this earrings are the best.They shine real good & espicially in the light.With these earrings i have people saying woah i want this earrings.If u buy this earrings you are going to have people hating everywhere. <end>  Sterling Silver and Crystal Heart Earrings by Paris Hilton  These earings were very poorly made.I returned them.The stones were put in very sloppy.They look very cheap. <end>  Biggest Disappointment in an Earring Set  I was aghast when I opened the package to see the cheap look of these earrings. It was even more astonishing knowing that theParis Hilton name was behind it. Those stones were beyond cheap looking and had no glitz or sparkle! I immediately packaged them up and took to the nearest postal service for return.They sure had potential and I had every intention of buying as gifts for others if the set I received were as nice as I had thought theywould be. I did take the time to review the comments at Amazonwhich is a wonderful option, but in this case, somehow I didnot agree with the majority of the reviews. I guess it is true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Perhaps it was justbecause it had the Paris Hilton name that was the draw. Too bad they didn't work out as they could have been worn dressed up or down ! ! <end>  valintines  I PURCHASED THESE FOR MY 40 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HER BIRTHDAY IN ON VALENTINES DAY. SHE REALLY LOVES THEM. <end>  Bling Bling  These earrings are really cute---it is obvious that people who put down Paris Hilton are jealous of her. Hey--some people are just luckier than others---get over it. <end>  Totally cute & Ultra feminine!  These earrings and their sassy shade of pink will allow any glam girl to shimmer to her fullest! <end>  "PARIS HILTON HAS AN EXCELLENT STYLE!"  These earings make an excellent date, Christmas, or special ocassion gift! People would love to own one of those beautiful earings! I am the reviewer of Cold Mountain and Sony Video Camera. I like these as much as someone else would!

This was a birthday gift for my daughter and received it promptly and in perfect condition. <end>  Cheap, tacky, overpriced junk  I saw a chain just like this in Claire's the other day. It cost $15, and I'd bet any amount of money that it would last longer than Hilton's line - and this is from a store known for its cheaply-made costume jewelry.Guess what, girls? A 3-and-a-half-foot long sterling silver chain with glued-on "crystals" (read  cubic zirconia at best, plastic at worst) doesn't cost $95 to produce. It costs maybe - maybe! - $10, and that's assuming the factory's in the US. Don't throw any more of your money away. Why mothers would even allow, let alone encourage, their teenage daughters to idolize a trashy, spoiled, vapid waste of space like Paris Hilton is beyond me. <end>  WAY overpriced peice of JUNK  Honestly, who wants to hang a chain around their waist? No, seriously? Can you imagine how that would even FEEL?! Ugh, to me, this is the biggest waste of money if i've ever seen one. 100 dollars of CRAP!! You can buy those fake rhinestones in the craft store, stick them around your waist, and they'd look just the same, not only cost about, hm, FIVE DOLLARS, at the most!!! Don't buy this, it's honestly a COMPLETE waist of money. <end>  puuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrfect  This piece of jewelery is really hot. Lolz newaii u noe wat? when I first brought his I wasn't so sure about the quality it looked kind of fragile online but once I opened this it turned out to be so amazing. No I'm not lying. It was mostly gold with a touch of pink Swarovski heart crystals . It looked really glistening and I wore it to the spring dance. It was wonderful and stable but If your on a budget I'm not sure if you should buy it. Although it really is very princess like and strong <end>  This belly chain is gorgeous  I think this belly chain is really nice, it is a bit expensive for me as I am only 14 but I think it is really pretty, it is kind of hippy chick. I think this belly chain would suit anyone whether you are a fashion follower or a hippy chick. <end>
 B0002IGHSE  Sterling Liquid Silver and Gemstone Beaded Anklet ||	  Liquid silver anklet  Simple and beautiful. Beads and silver are a nice combination--they don't over-power each other. <end>
 B0002IHBRA  Starter Base for the Italian Charm Bracelets ||	  Mom loved it  Unlike some others who reviewed this product and others like it, I found the mechanics of adding charms to this bracelet fairly simple and obvious. You just slide one of the links out to full extension, at which time an opening on the bottom becomes visible and the next link just hooks on through that opening. No sweat! This was a great gift for my arthritic 70-something mom who has trouble fastening and unfastening most jewelry. Since this bracelet is stretchy, she can just slip it on and off. She loves it, and therefore so do I. <end>  Lovely starter...and VERY FAST SHIPPING!  I absolutely can't wait to start adding links to this lovely bracelet! It's positively beautiful.Great value, too. But what's astonishing is how FAST it arrived! I received it within 2 (business) days of ordering!Great seller, would highly recommend doing business with! A++++ <end>  Love it!  I tried looking for a starter base at many of my local shops to no avail. I was very pleased to find it here. Super fast shipping. Bracelet is nice and shiny. Very happy. <end>  cute brazalet  This brazalet is a nice one and its very affordable, i recomend this one if you dont want to spend too much money in a brazalet. <end>  Starter "Base" for the Italian Charm Bracelets  20 link Starter "Base" for the Italian Charm BraceletsI ordered the offer of the 2 Starter "Bases" for the Italian Charm Bracelets on Saturday and received them on Wednesday! I'm absolutely thrilled at how fast the product arrived and I received exactly what I expected. I will definately tell my friends about my experience with Sabrina Silver and won't hesitate to order from them again in the future. I only wish I would have found them sooner, I wasted a lot of time checking at local stores trying to find these bracelets. <end>  Starter Italian Charm Bracelet  The bracelet came in a timely manner and was well-packaged. However the bracelet did not have enough links on it especially if you wanted to start with only one charm. Moreover, instructions for adding and taking off links and charms should have come with it since people like me don't know how these bracelets are constructed. <end>  Perfect  It came quickly and was exactly what I thought it would be. gives me plenty of room to add charms. Thanks! <end>
 B0002ILJF0  14k Diamond Butterfly Necklace in White Gold ||	  My new favorite necklace!  This necklace exceeded my expectations! The pictures show a lot of the detail, but they just don't capture how beautiful this necklace is. The chain and the butterflies have much more shine and sparkle than I expected. It is also a perfect length at around 17 inches. I haven't been able to find another unique necklace like this for this price. It is a perfect necklace if you like dainty and feminine! <end>  Pretty good  Girlfriend liked it. Her friends liked it even more. Can't really see the diamonds too well, but they at least give a nice glimmer. I payed $119.00 for it in August 2007. <end>  Really Sweet Necklace  I bought this necklace a couple of years ago. I paid less than the price shown, but would gladly have paid more. It is one of my favorite necklaces ever and I wear it all the time. There is quite a bit of gold in the necklace. You won't be disappointed if you like butterflies or if you like staion neclaces. <end>

I ordered this ring on Sunday night around 11pm and it arrived on Tuesday. Very fast shipping. When I opened the package the ring box was wrapped in the Katarina paper (looked nice). I am very happy with this ring. Just what I hoped for &lt;3 <end>
 B0002J2V9W  Stainless Steel & Genuine Zoppini 18K Gold Italian Charm Initial H ||	  Charming Charm  This slide charm was a gift for a coworker. It arrived in a timely way and its appearance was as described. The combination of the stainless and gold gave it a modern style yet it didn't look inexpensive. I was pleased with both the product and service. <end>
 B0002J2VNI  Stainless Steel & Genuine 18K Gold Italian Charm Hanging Initial B ||	  Not Bad and Not Great!!!!  Charm looks much better in the picture, of course I understand that it's much smaller in person. The quality is not that great, unlike the description. I've seen much better in the stores!! I will not return it because the shipping will cost me more than the charm is worth. Too bad for me, I've learned my lesson! Thanks anyway - my fault! <end>
 B0002J6QG6  14K White Gold Round Created Alexandrite Men's Men's Ring ||	  Not exactly  Its very nice, and I do like it. However, it is not exactly like the pic. Maybe its the lighting or the angle, but the one in the picture looks much better. Mainly the stone. There is a visible difference in the size/setting. <end>

 B0002J8F5Q  14K White Gold Heart Genuine Black Onyx Ring ||	  Diamond fell off  I used this ring as an engagement ring. It's a very beautiful ring but I did have an issue with the one I recieved. I couldn't of had it for over a month before one of the small white diamonds beside the onyx fell off. I had no problem reaching Jewels For Me though. I sent it back no charge and it was fixed and back to me in maybe 2 weeks. <end>

 B0002J8Z2Y  14K Yellow Gold Heart Genuine Black Onyx Ring ||	  Gorgeous!  My ring came in the mail today and I was thrilled. It came with a little bag and a small teddy bear. I have delicate and small hands so I do not mind the size of the ring...actually I think it is perfect. I've always hated wearing gaudy rings, feeling like they looked ridiculous and wrong on my finger. For a while, I wouldn't even wear rings because I thought they'd look wrong on my fingers just because of sheer size! This ring is perfect! I love the little heart shaped onyx. The small diamonds are beautiful. I feel that it is very feminine and just right for a woman like me. <end>  slightly disappointed  Yes, it was alright, but I thought it could have been a little bigger. I do not know much about black onyx so maybe the price was right. I could not find a womens black onyx ring in any stores where I am from so it may my search easier. Also, my wife loves heart shaped things so it should work out. I am gving it too her for Christmas. <end>
 B0002J8ZE2  14K White Gold Heart Genuine Black Onyx Ring ||	  Magnificent  I love this ring! It is beautiful, pretty durable (thus far ;) ) and one of a kind. I am very happy that I chose this ring as my engagement ring. My fiance also chose a black ring with "cable wire" around the middle of the ring from Amazon ^-^ But, like all rings, if your hands are dry, it spins. I hate that! LOL! <end>

 B0002JKK5O  Pearl and Diamond Hoop Earring in 14k Yellow Gold (closeout) ||	  holding up well over time  These earrings were even prettier 'in person' than in the photo. When I first bought them, I had serious concerns. The hinges seemed to have too much 'play' in them. I also had to bend the prong down gently to get it to slip into the hole. I worried about the earrings falling off, or the hinges falling apart. I've had them for quite a while now, and they have held up just fine. They haven't come open unexpectedly, and they still look beautiful. I'd upgrade the star rating if Amazon would let me! <end>  beautiful earrings, loose clasp, $99  I bought these earrings for about $99.00 - I don't know why they cost so much more now. They are truly lovely, but the clasp on one of the earrings is very loose. One of the earrings fell out of my ear and I thought it was lost forever. Fortunately, it turned up MONTHS later. <end>
 B0002JLQF2  Anklet, 'Floral Scrolls' 10" L ||	  My Fave Anklet  I love this anklet! It's just the right combination of exotic and understated and it goes everywhere so I've worn it all summer. Definitely a great find. <end>
 B0002JOCN0  Sterling Silver Victorian Dark Garnet Choker Necklace ||	  Elegant piece of jewelry!  I was very, very pleased with this necklace! It is absolutely gorgeous! The only thing I don't like about it is that it's kind of heavy and the hook clasp isn't like any "normal" necklace hook clasp. <end>
 B0002K8TIS  10.72 TCW Oval-Cut Mystic Fire-Colored Cubic Zirconia 18k Yellow Gold over Sterling Silver Ring ||	  FIVE STARS PLUS THOUSANDS  This ring is gorgeous. It looks tremendously expensive. The colors sizzle and I believe it could be worn with any color to perfection.There are blues, purples, greens, rose, and fiery black shades at some angles it appears to be sapphire, at another it appears onyx, at another emerald, etc. I love rings on each finger and now I cannot do that when I wear this ring, because everything else next to this looks meaningless. I have rings much more costly and they are just lost beside this ring.This ring is large and beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about it...BRAVO! I would wear it with my best formal wear or my daily jeans and not be worried it can carry any look with success. <end>  THE RING THAT WILL MAKE YOU GASP!  When I first opened the box to see the ring, I actually did gasp! I was in awe of this ring's dazzling beauty. I love cool jeweltones, so the purples, blues, pinks and greens that twinkle from this ring while being surrounded by cubic zirconias are just gorgeous. I have a lot of nice rings, some real and expensive, yet this is the ring that I've gotten the most compliments on. <end>  Nice ring...  This ring is beautiful and especial but is bigger than I thought ...so it looks heavy in my hand...I would have appreciated more a size more delicate....like it anyway..... <end>  5 Stars are NOT enough!!!  While I don't own this ring (but I soon will), I've seen it in person and it is indeed a lovely ring. The picture does not do it any justice. And as a previousl reviewer indicated - you can't tell if it's a sapphire, etc. When it hits the light there are so many different colors to this ring...simply gorgeous! And it can definitely hold it's own against more costly rings! <end>
 B0002K8U64  PalmBeach Jewelry Sterling Silver Hoop Earrings 35.64 mm Diameter ||	  Looks Are Deceiving  I received my earrings in a timely manner, however, the packaging was not secure enough to prevent the earrings from arriving with scratches. Not only that, but the image is deceiving. I didn't anticipate these earrings being so large! I felt like I was transported back to the 80's!! The design is pretty, but the clasp makes the earring pretty difficult to easily secure. Not a good choice. <end>
 B0002K9L7G  PalmBeach Jewelry Cultured Freshwater Biwa Pearl with White Topaz Accents Sterling Silver Ring ||	  More than picture shows  I purchased this ring as a present. Great communication with seller, fast service, but more importantly - it is Beautiful!! So much nicer than photo shows. The accents around the pearl just set off the color and finish. Looks as though it costs 5 times more than I paid. Outstanding ring that I love and will love giving away. I will definitely be back to purchase more from this company. <end>

Thanks Amazon! <end>
 B0002KNLS6  Coaster Jewelry Armoire, Ivory Finish Wood with Hand Painted Roses Floral ||	  Beautiful Piece  I bought this as a Christmas present for my young daughter. The armoire is exactly as described. It is easy to assemble (just screw in the legs and hinged top) and even came with a kit to screw it into the wall to prevent it tipping over. It's gorgeous and reasonably priced and arrived in perfect condition. <end>  Awesome product  Very easy to put together and looks better than picture. Roses look pink but they are more of a plum color. Good price for such a beautiful piece of furniture. My Granddaughter will love it. <end>  Great for the price  A beautiful addition to my bedroom. It was easy to put together and came in on scheduled. I receive a lot of compliments on it and I am very pleased with the purchase. <end>  ELEGANT AND BEAUTIFUL  THIS ITEM WAS A WONDERFUL SURPRISE. THE QUALITY IS SO MUCH MORE THAN I COULD HAVE EVER HOPED FOR. <end>  Beautiful  So excited to receive this as an early valentines day gift. My hubby unpacked it the bottom draw was nail wrong and half off. He asked if he should pack it up, I said no way. A little glue and a nail and its perfect. I been looking for a while and always went back to this one. Love the size color only 3 stars because of draw. I feel that error should have been corrected. But would buy again <end>  Very pretty; but cheaply made; but not that cheap in price for the quality  My Armoire arrived damaged. The front of the bottom drawer had broken off & the mirror on the lid is all discolored.The armoire is made a very cheap quality pressboard. I did get a replacement; but the return is bothersome as the Amazon box is so huge & the product is heavy & I can't lift it. My replacement arrived & now I have to figure out how to get it to UPS. <end>  Great gift for anyone  It was very beautiful and well built. Gift for my daughter and she loved it. Would highly recommend it to everyone <end>  My Jewelry Armoire  This was one of my favorite Amazon purchases. It looks just like it does on the page looks beautiful in the room and was so simple to put together. I love it. <end>  Nice product for the price  I bought this for my 6 year old daughter along with the matching vanity. It is a nice piece of furniture for the price and with the flowers girly enough for the young. It is a nice set to move with her into the teenage and adult years. I was looking for something she could use now and take with her when she is older and moves out on her own. For the same price you could buy a kids vanity that would be useless in a few years. It is sturdy and the customer service was great. The top was cracked and they picked up the broken one and replaced it within 5 days. It only took one e-mailed request. <end>  Beautiful But Beware !  I fell in love with this armoir'e the first time I saw it. So, I bought it, I was so excited to get it, and put it together in my room. But then I noticed, there was no hardware inside the box. I tore the box completely apart looking for the hardware that was never there in the first place. I'm still waiting for the hardware to be shipped to me, until then, my armoir'e is sitting in my room, and I'm not able to use it at all. Take about disappointing! <end>  Love it!  I was looking for a jewelry armoire (or really, an armoire for jewelry and all the other miscellany in my bedroom), and this seemed pretty. I was a bit worried it would seem loud, cheap or juvenille in person, but not at all. It really is pretty in person, and is very well made. I am very happy with the drawer space and overall organization (number of drawers, space within, dividers, etc). Overall, very happy with this purchase!! <end>  What a beautiful Armoire.  I'm very please with this armoire it was a bit smaller then the one I had but all in all it was just perfect for what jewerly I had to put into it..After being robbed not once but twice withing 2 months, I wanted something that would brighten up my room and with the beautiful lavender flowers draping across the front of it it did just that. The cream color blended well in my room and it looks just beautiful up against the wall. <end>  Jewelry Armoire of Love  I am glad I purchased this armoire. I like that the drawers come all the way out so I can go through them and I like that the color is cream as the picture seems. <end>  Ordered for my mom  My mom had been looking for a painted armoire for a long time. I ordered this for her and she loves it. It is tall, beautiful, and made as well as any of the other jewelry armoire she has had. It is off white, and the flowers have a lilac, pick color. <end>  Coaster Jewelry Armoire a real jewel  I ordered this Jewelry Armoire from Amazon at about half the price that it was selling for virtually everywhere else. It came packed very well and in perfect condition. It is as beautiful up close as it is in the pictures. My first impression was that it is so very large, and that's nice. It is sturdy, made well and easy to assemble(I just had to screw the mirrored top on and the legs). I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and it was everything and more than she wished for. <end>  HAVE NOT RECEIVE MY ITEM AS YET  My children PLACE THIS ORDER FOR JEWELRY ARMOIRE MOTHER'S DAY AND AS OF MAY 17 HAVE NOT RECEIVE ITEM. I CALL THE EVERY DAY AND THEY GIVING ME THE RUN A ROUND. ICoaster Jewelry Armoire, Ivory Finish Wood with Hand Painted Roses FloralAM VERY DISPOINTED WITH THIS SELLER.WILL NOT ORDER ANY THING FROM THEM AGAIN. <end>  Very nice for the price!  The armoire is solid and very pretty. It definitely is not white but cream colored. I say to the previous reviewer that said it was cheap, it's $125! Not exactly high end furniture prices. The drawers will pull right out, there are no stops on them. I really like the piece and am very happy with it. I gave it 4 stars only because you have to attach the top and it takes two people to get it right. If not careful you can attach it crooked and it won't shut right. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. <end>  Very cheap quality - Don't buy it  I purchased this armoire based on the positive comments from other buyers. I was very disappointed at the very cheap quality of the drawers. When you pull them out far enough to have a glimse of the items in the back compartments, the drawer just falls out. If you ever want to see items stored towards the back of the drawers you will have to pull the drawer out entirely. Very cheap workmanship. Not worth it. If you are a prospective buyer, I'd go for one of the more expensive and durable models. <end>  Floral jewelry armoir  AMAZING!!!!This jewelry box was even better than I ever imagined. I would buy from this company again. Actually, I need one more for my other daughter. Don't hestitate, it is perfect. <end>  Jewelry Armoire  This armoire is a beautiful addition to my bedroom and very convenient to store all my jewelry. Now I can actually find that necklace that I want to wear instead of shuffling through a shoe box.My only concern was that the color was cream instead of the stated white finish. It was so pretty I decided to keep it, but would have preferred it in white. <end>  Top Notch Company and Item!  This was a Christmas gift for my wife, her "big" present for this years holiday. She had been dropping hints for a few years and really did need one to help organize her jewelry which until now was scatered here & there. Her Armoire arrived very quickly and the packaging was constructed like a suit of armour, double boxed and very securely wraped. It was very easy to put together and anyone can do it with nothing but a couple of screwdrivers in 5 min. or less. Look closely for the hardware though. Mine was wrapped in a small plastic bag and taped to a bottom corner inside the box which blends in with the cardboard and is easy to miss. I can see that this will be around for years to come and will probably be passed down to my daughter when the time comes. It is very well made and as my heading states " top Notch" for quality. I highly recommend this item in all respects. <end>  pleasantly surprised  this product was much more than i expected. your photo of it did not do it justice it is a remarkable item i have had nothing but compliments on it. i thought it would come shattered and i would have to send it back but to my surprise it was expertly packed not a dent or scratch on it .i am completly satisfied with the item and no one should be nervous about ordering this and i guarantee they will be completly satisfied. thankyou harriet hachey <end>  Beautiful!  Floral Hand Painted Jewelry Armoire Mirrored Wood BoxI purchased this Jewelry Armoire as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter who wanted one similar to mine, but with mine costing a whole lot more, I was pleasantly surprised at the price of this one! When it arrived I was extremely pleased with the quality and workmanship also! It looks very pretty in her room & there is plenty of room for all of the jewelry a young lady loves & I am sure she will have this for many years! I am very pleased with this purchase & with the quick delivery and professionalism of the seller~ <end>  I Love My Jewelry Armoire  Beautiful!! I actually purchased this back in 2005 and it looks the same as the day it arrived. Very well made. After reading previous comment, I don't know why anyone would have a problem with the drawers falling out?? How does the saying go "A bull in a china cabinet" hahaha <end>  Love everything about this item!  I'm very happy with this purchase. It was down to two jewelry armoires and I chose this one for the price, it was $150 less than the other one. Well, am I glad I chose this one. I'm so happy with it. Not only was it packed securely but it was easy to assemble and all the legs were even when stood upright. I love the mauve, velvety lining since my eyes are not what they used to be and the other armoire had black lining, I prefer the mauve. It matches my decor beautifully since my bedroom has a lot of vintage mauve and is country victorian. Also, it's sturdy and quite heavy. I love it, can't wait to fill it with all my treasures. <end>  Very disappointed!  I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas. It looked so pretty. The first one arrived and the lid was broken in half, so I sent it back. Unfortunately I didn't unpack and really look at the first one (I would not have reordered). the second one was unbroken. The paint job on these is marginal at best. The drawers all were very rough to pull out. Grandpa spent several hours sanding and applying plastic runners on drawers so they pulled smoothly. I do not feel it is of very good quality. My granddaughter is only ten and it will be OK for her &#34;little girl&#34; jewelry , but I am very disappointed. Do not expect much! <end>
 B0002KQQZG  14k Yellow Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1 1/2ctw, J, I3) ||	  surprisingly beautiful  I've been looking for diamond stud earrings for sometime now.I was skeptical about purchasing diamonds over the internet but with the 30 day guarantee I decided to take a chance.Boy, am I glad I did.These earrings are beautiful.The color is on the lower end of the spectrum but the earrings look white and clear to the naked eye.However, when placed next to diamonds in the "G" range, the color is obviously tinged with yellow.The diamonds are clear and the size is amazing.There is nothing to compare these with in the local mall jewelry stores.Great earrings for a low cost---especially with the extra April sale. <end>  Beautiful !  I searched for diamond studs that were a good size (I have long hair and wanted them to be visible). I was a little wary of the I3 clarity, imagining them to be cloudy. Not at all - they are beautiful !We had them appraised - they're I1 clarity, same color as mentioned, and valued at $3,000. I shopped extensively for diamond studs, and never saw anything at this size at anywhere near this price, not to mention the quality. To have them appraised at three times what we paid for them is very gratifying. <end>  Pretty good  I bought these for my wife as a "birth" gift for our second child. I was very skeptical as I have never seen an I3 diamond, which is the bottom of the scale. When I first received the diamonds, I was VERY impressed. The cut, color and clarity at first glance were excellent. Below are my observations, but keep in mind that I am an informed consumer but not a gemologist.First, the cut was fine. I didn't break out calipers or anything but it looked symmetrical to me and I'm a professional engineer.The color was colorless as I was not able to see any hint of yellow. "J" is the last letter on the near colorless scale.The size was excellent!! Think about it, each diamond is about 3/4 carat which is amazing considering the price.Now, the clarity is fine from about 1 foot away or more. The diamonds I received were clear looking, not cloudy. The reason they are I3 was that each diamond had a feather that you could see with your naked eye. You really have to look for them, but when you find them they are noticeable. At least you know they are real. Keep in mind that when your wife is wearing them, 99.9% of most people will never see diamond earrings that close and will not be able to see the flaws. If they do, you have bigger problems.Overall, they sparkle very well, even when I brought them to the jewelry store and compared them to better quality diamonds. You have to ask yourself, does size really matter? I opted for size instead of clarity, especially because they are earrings.UPDATE  I still don't believe it but I just got it appraised for $4,400. I got them reset in a white gold three pronged martini setting, so they were able to get a good look at it. They said it was G color and SI2. Maybe I got lucky. <end>

 B0002KS8T8  3 mm Brushed Center Comfort-Fit Women's Wedding Band in 14k White Gold ||	  Not bad, but I don't think I will buy from SZUL again.  I had placed my order directly from the Szul website (on Nov. 22, '06) as I didn't want to wait for the 3-4 day processing mentioned above. I don't know if this made any difference with the speed of processing/shipping. I just got my ring today.The picture above isn't the best representation of it. In real life, it actually looks a little 'plastic-y'. It almost feels like it too because it is quite light in my hand. However, at least as of now, the ring is comfortable on my finger and I like how it looks. I will be wearing this ring on my left hand ring finger - the brushed center is chafing against my middle finger little, I just hope it doesn't get worse over time.I'm a bit wary of Szul, I read some feedback on Amazon about problems with shipping and customer service. For me, customer service was efficient enough. The thing that got to me was that I was told twice that the item "will be shipping today", they told me this on two different days. First on Nov. 30th.Dec. 5th came, I called for a tracking number, seeing as they had said that it had shipped already. They say that it didn't ship on Nov. 30th because it needed to be resized and that it "will ship today".Of course that got me worried, I didn't understand why they bothered telling me that it shipped on the 30th and no one said anything about resizing.It seems like in dealing with customer service, email wouldn't be the best way. In emailing, their responses were delayed. Basically, you really won't get anywhere if you plan on just emailing them. It's not a problem to call, the people you speak to are nice BUT I don't like that you have to call them to sort of nudge them about your order and having them do something about it. It didn't quite feel like a smooth transaction.Well, eventually they did give me a tracking number. (FedEx 2 day - shipping was free at the time of my purchase) and at least I got the right size and the item arrived the next day after talking with them.I also read alot of positive reviews/experiences about Szul, but it seems like it's almost like a luck of the draw. You may have a good experience or you could be up for annoyance or mishaps. Of all the companies/sites that I have ordered from online, I've never experienced this kind of 'wishy washiness' I guess there's always a first and I know that it's not a perfect world.I don't think I will be ordering from Szul again. I'm still not sure weather I would recommend buying from them.All in all, I think Szul just has alot to improve... <end>

 B0002MR9UK  Signature Tarnish Free Large Hoop Earrings ||	  Great earrings  Fun earrings. A ''tad'' bigger than I expected. But, I got over it, and wear them all the time. Because of this order I figured out how big 20mm, 30mm and 50mm measurements are in regards to hoops! LOL. Basically, this one is about almost 2in. <end>  tarnish free sterling earrings  Easy to care for earrings. No longer do I have dull silver hoops in need of a polish. Also, they have an easy yet secure clasp. <end>  Exactly as Pictured  These hoops are perfect and are exactly as pictured. I love them! Perfect size, not too big, not too small, and great shiny silver. I'm so glad I bought them. <end>  Love these earrings!!  These earrings are just as they were described online. They are shiny and comfortable. Great price for the product! <end>  sterling silver hoop earrings  the earrings was just what i was looking for not to big and not to small .it was a good buy <end>  Bought these for my mom ...  a few days later I asked to see her new earrings."I'm not wearing them" she said."Why not?""They broke."They broke, both of them at the clasp, the day after Mother's Day--the day after I gave them to her. <end>  Unless you are a pirate... buyer beware.  These hoops are flimsy and the clasps are terrible. I was looking for a pair of daily wear hoops. These are not the right choice. The clasps did not stay shut and the earrings would fall off my ears throughout the day, which is not a good look when you are in meetings.Alas, within 2 days of my new earrings arriving, one of them has fallen off somewhere and now I only have one. And since I'm not a pirate, that just won't do. I wasted $20 here and hope you don't do the same. Keep looking. <end>  I [heart] these earrings!  These earrings are just what I was looking for. Make no mistake, they are pretty big, but that's exactly what I was looking for. I've had them for 2 months now and wear them a lot and they are still nice and shiney! <end>  Great earrings!!!  Beautiful sterling silver hoops! Love the hinged closings! Big but not too big even for my 5'2" frame! <end>
 B0002N3ONU  6mm Japanese Akoya Black Pearl and Diamond Stud Earrings in 14k White Gold ||	  Sent the wrong earrings! But very helpful once contacted.  I placed my order on May 1st, in plenty of time for Mother's Day. I received a package on May 4th ... and it was the wrong pair of earrings! I immediately called and was told I could keep the incorrect earrings at no charge, which was nice; and that they would immediately ship out the correct earrings for delivery on Monday, May 9th. Well, it's now Tuesday, May 10th and I don't have them yet. I called again today and was told they're in transit and they'll be delivered on Wednesday, May 11th. I obviously can't rate the earrings I ordered ... but I can say the earrings I received, which are black pearl studs (with no diamonds) are very nice! <end>

 B0002OHPHK  Meia Titanium Ring with Sapphire & Diamonds ||	  The Perfect Ring  This ring is every bit as beautiful as it appears in the picture. The contrast between the brushed titanium center and the polished edges of the ring is very distinctive. Also, the stones are a good size - no diamond "chips", but lovely, brilliant stones, and the stones are slightly recessed into the band, thus protected from damage. No prongs means that the ring will not catch in my knit clothing either, so I will wear it every day. The only improvement I would make would be to have a lighter blue sapphire in the center. Otherwise, the ring is perfect. <end>  Beautiful!  I bought this for my fiance as his wedding band - we both LOVE it, and it is more beautiful than in the photographs, and very heavy and rounded for a comfortable fit.A magnificent ring, for a magnificent man - it was perfect!

 B0002PE61C  Carnelian and pearl necklace, 'Balinese Blossom' ||	  Truly unique  I purchased the necklace as gift for my daughter-in-law. She does not like bulky accessories, so I was hoping the necklace would be okay. As it turned-out, the piece was substantial, yet delicately feminine. She loved it! It has a beautiful and unique design - not your typical "department store stuff." I would like to have one for myself. The craftsmanship is fantastic. <end>
 B0002PEEIM  Amethyst necklace, 'Violet Flame' 24" L ||	  Absolutely Beautiful  I ordered my necklace several months ago, and I am absolutely amazed at it's beauty and the quality of craftsmanship. The pictures shown simply cannot do justice for it. The creator of this necklace is incredibly talented and devoted to her work, and I am very thankful that she has created a necklace that I have come to love so much. I have received so many compliments regarding the beautiful stones the necklace is made with, and how I got the necklace at such a good deal. If you love amethyst, you absolutely must add this to your collection. Also, I commend the company's great care in customer service. <end>
 B0002PEKU4  Necklace, 'Thai Garden' 20" L ||	  Beautiful, solid necklace  This necklace is a very solid necklace, slightly heavy. That is what I was looking for. It feels very comfortable and secure. It is well made, with just enough adornment to give it a little more oomph. <end>
 B0002PR2WM  Silver Forest Light House Earrings ||	  Lighthouse Earrings  These earrings are more beautiful than they look on the picture. I love them! <end>  Lovely for Lighthouse Lovers  These earrings are super nice. They are lighthouses that are not quite so obvious. I really like this company's earrings. <end>  Great earrings  Bought this for a lady who loves lighthouses. Perfect little gift and a very reasonable price. Good workmanship. Would suggest this product for others. <end>
 B0002PR3MQ  Signature Tarnish Free Teardrop Wire ||	  Beautiful Earrings  I got these earrings as a gift to myself from my parents with a g/c from Amazon. They are really great, a bit smaller than I expected at about an inch long. They have a nice weight to them and their simplicity means that they can go with almost any outfit/hair do. They are so comfortable I can even get away with wearing them when I sleep. <end>  Perfect for all occasions  These earrings are extremely light and comfortable to wear. As noted in a previous review, they are a little smaller than I expected, but it doesn't matter. Their simplicity goes with all outfits, whether I'm in jeans or dressing to go out. I've received nothing but compliments! <end>  teardrop wire st. silver earring  Love 'em. subltle & stylish. I am a little concerned about breakage at top where they curve to hang on earlobe, they bend easily there, with care they should be o.k. <end>  Wow, really not that great  These earrings had great reviews for the most part, and, in the picture, they look elegant. I know they are inexpensive, but I did not expect them to look cheap. The silver is uneven and rough in places. The bend is haphazard and different between the two earrings (glaringly so) in both bend width and section length. When in my ears, one hung longer than the other, and one had a longer "tail" in the back than the other. I tried to re-bend the wide bend and the minute I grabbed the two sections, I felt like the bend would break. I wanted some simple, plain silver earrings I could wear with a cocktail dress, but these are definitely NOT them. I wouldn't wear these with jeans out in the horse pasture. I will return them as soon as possible, and I'm sorry I have to pay the return shipping because these aren't even worth that. <end>  Earrings  Way wider than the picture suggests, also the post comes down farther than the bottom of the earring giving an odd appearance to the jewelry when worn. <end>
 B0002PXZ14  Moveable Carousel Charm -K202 ||	  unclear picture  I collect carousel charms made of all kinds of materials. I would like to be able to see what the figures on this charm are, but the picture is so unclear that I can't tell if they are horses or something else. Too bad, if it were horses I would buy it. <end>
 B0002Q2BUY  Ornate Sterling Silver Adjustable Spoon Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11) ||	  Beautiful spoon ring  Love this traditional looking spoon ring. you can wear it for casual to dresser style outfits. It blends to make that prefect look. I wear it at work, going out on weekends, etc. I would recommend it. It's true to size. <end>  Nice ring...but...  Nice...but once you have adjusted I would HIGHLY recommend to bring it to a jeweler and have it soldered. Makes a structurally stronger ring. <end>
 B0002Q91T8  Snake Charm -C1168 ||	  I love this  This snake pendant is absolutley beautiful, but i did find it at another jewelry store for half the price ;) <end>
 B0002QXNBA  Thread Earrings    THLSS    Long Length, Sterling Silver ||	  Not worth the money, get them cheaper elsewhere.  I absolutely love these earrings but they are not worth $39.99, I was expecting a longer stick on each end and a little thicker. These are very light, good for your ears but it makes them swing too much. I bought a similar pair at a mall jewelry store, sterling silver, longer sticks for $12.00 but with a swarovski crystal on one end. I really liked the idea of a stick on each end but I was expecting a little more bulk. These are almost invisible when you're wearing them unless you get up close. <end>
 B0002SPG5E  Barbell - Purple Marble Tongue Ring ||	  Cool Color....  I love the color of this tongue ring and I also like that the ball is not painted (which is pretty hard to find now a days) it's a very cool looking design. <end>
 B0002SPG9K  Barbell - Pink Flower Tongue Ring ||	  Cute Pink Flower Barbell  I would buy this again and I definitely recommend it, looks just like it is in the picture and stays in nicely.  ) <end>
 B0002SPH4O  Glacier Glow In The Dark Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Like it!  I love the color of this tongue ring and I also like that the ball is a see through color. <end>  Excelent Product!!! Buena Calidad!!!  La calidad es buenisima y llego en perfecto estado.The quality of this product are perfect!! <end>  Confused  According to my girlfriend who I bought it for "It doesn't glow bright bright!" I gave it 5 stars she gave it 3. As we all know what the lady say goes. 3 stars it is! <end>  glow in the dark  It' works well and glows in the dark, but it has to be DARK. If you want something more noticeable and bright, look for a Glow Mouth Piece. <end>
 B0002SPHEY  Purple Paradise Hypnotic Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Nice Color Combo  I love the color of this tongue ring and I also like that the ball is not painted (which is pretty hard to find now a days) it's a very cool looking design. <end>
 B0002SPHFI  Radical Red Black Hypnotic Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Looks Pink  I bought this product for the balls. I wear a 14 gauge earring, and I had a set of balls similar to the ones displaced. It is a pretty good product, but has one flaw. The red is transparent acrylic. The balls I had previously looked exactly the same, but were solid acrylic. Unfortunately, because of the red on white, in sun light or florescent lighting, the red looks pink. <end>
 B0002T2GW4  Spiral Twister - Arctic Blast Beach Ball Belly Button Ring ||	  Same as the kiosk in the mall, except for the price  I ordered eight navel rings, mostly out of curiosity Sapphire Blue GEM DRAGONFLY Belly Ring,Spiral Twister - Arctic Blast BEACH BALL Belly Button Ring,White Puprle PANDA BALL Belly Button Ring,Blue DOUBLE CABACHON Banana Belly Ring,Pink GLITTER Spiral Twister Belly Ring,Crystalline Gem DISCO BALL Glitter Belly Ring,Fuchsia Gem DAINTY BUTTERFLY Belly Button Ring, andWhite Clear PANADA BALL Belly Button Ring. Normally I buy them from the kiosk in the mall for $25-30 each. Sometimes the kiosk has a deal for when you spend a $100 or more, but even with the deal, they are terribly overpriced.THESE ARE THE SAME as the kind in the mall. Side by side, they are the same quality. They look the same, they feel the same, they are the same. The only difference is that they have not been handled by sales clerks and strangers in the mall. Oh, and the price is not the same.I've discovered that I go through these like earrings. Either a part falls off or catches on clothing and it's all over. All of my favorite ones have been ruined. One part is gone and they need to be thrown away. It's not good to get too 'attached.'I bought these from Body Candy. They arrived in a few days, much earlier than the date given on purchase, and the prices were excellent. <end>
 B0002TA1US  New Sterling Silver Beach Sand Dollar Pendant or Charm ||	  Good Buy  We received this sand dollar pendant and it is a good size for the price. Only wish it was just a bit bigger, but looks well on a short chain. <end>  Very nice  It's even nicer than I thought. I've bought several items from Silver Insanity and I must say that I'm really happy and impressed with the service. I ordered the sand dollar and two other items on the same day and Silver Insanity combined the order for me (without realizing it, I had placed the orders separately) saving me 15 dollars! <end>  sand dollar charm  This sand dollar charm is very detailed and is the perfect size for my charm bracelet. It is a memory from my sorority reunion on the Puget Sound where there were sand dollars all over the beach in front of our house. <end>  Silver Sand Dollar  This is a very nice piece. I wear it on a black silk necklace. Stunning. <end>  Cute Charm  This is a really fun little piece that looks great on a necklace or a bracelette. <end>
 B0002TIKFG  Pebbles Freshwater Cultured Pearl Earring ||	  My favorite earrings  These earrings have become the ones I wear the most and I ordered them a good six months ago. The picture doesn't do them justice. The pearls are very nice with a lovely fine ear wire with a sturdy rear hinge and a nice design in the front. The detail just above the pearls is a fine gold beading. They are just the right length--not too long. I ordered similar ones with dark green pearls since receiving these and wear those a lot also. If you like pearl earrings with a closed ear wire, I am sure you will be pleased with this purchase. <end>
 B0002TPPJK  Single Silver Rose Belly Button Ring ||	  Wonderful!  I bought 5 of these in different colors for my Wife, aside from the bar being just a little too long for her (she had a shorter one to use) she absolutely loves them and switches them out to coordinate better with her mood and outfit. If there were more colors available, especially black, I would buy them all! <end>  love it  Very cute belly button ring. It came in a sealed bag and shipped quickly. I'm pleased with the product I got. <end>  Awesome! could not have been better.. just what i wanted, exactly as picture showed, have no complaints or problems with it  Awesome! could not have been better.. just what i wanted, exactly as picture showed, have no complaints or problems with it <end>  Nope  It scratched my belly button up, and it mad my belly button itch really bad. I wouldnt buy this ever <end>  Fell apart  Very cute, but the inside of the rose fell out within 48 hours. Should have expected that for the price, but still annoying. <end>  Cute, but a leaves red marks.  I bought this about a month ago, but only put it in a couple of days ago. Since I've been wearing it, the rose petals on the ring, dig into the lower part of my belly button, leaving red marks. Don't get me wrong, I love the ring, but I have to sit up all the time to avoid the redness. I love this ring. <end>  ok item  The flower fell off within a week. It got the job done, but it did not hold up well. <end>  Fell apart  I loved this belly ring, but there are three things wrong with it.1. It arrived with sharp edges that I had to dremmel off2. The piercing part is very long3. The rose fell off and had to be glued back on.UPDATE  Completely fell apart. I know it was only $5, but splurge on something else. <end>

 B0002TS9YI  Swarovski Green Crystal Drop Earrings ||	  Earrings  I love the cut and color of these earrings. I only wish that the crystals were larger. They look bigger on line than they really are. <end>
 B0002TVU5I  Fancy Japanese Akoya Cultured Pearl Ring ||	  Nice pearl ring  I gave the ring to my wife for Christmas, and she was very pleased. She has several other rings I have given her throughout the years, and this pearl ring is definitely one of her favorites. <end>

I will definitely be considering ordering again. I was impressed with the prices as well. <end>  14k gold endless small 1/2" hoop earings  These earrings were exactly what I wanted - very nice looking and well made. They were a gift and the person receiving them was very pleased. <end>  Strong little earrings!  I purchased these for my uncle who is a very large man, with large earlobes. He wanted a gold hoop that was strong enough to be left in and slept in, noticable without being flashy and would fit his earlobe! I was hesitant to order them, fearing they wouldnt work, I contacted the seller and they responded very quickly to my questions and were very helpful. Needless to say, my uncle loves them and they have held up great!! <end>  their okay  they are a little thin, but still nice for the price. the post could be a little longer for safety, but still do seem to be holding in well. <end>  Perfect!  I just adore these little hoops. They are EXACTLY what I was looking for. They are hard to get in (but I knew they would be, these types of hoops are the most difficult to get in) I have 5 holes in each ear and I bought these for my new 5th hole. They are newly pierced so this is why I had difficulty. They are just perfect. I will be back to buy another pair. Simple, elegant. A++++ <end>

 B0002V3QZI  Trillion Cut Sapphire and Diamond Ring 14K White Gold ||	  Exactly as pictured  My fiancee wanted a sapphire ring rather than a diamond and specifically wanted a trillion cut, dark sapphire. This ring was exactly what she wanted and matched the picture perfectly. She was thrilled with it. The only caveat I can see is that it can take a few days before items are shipped, even when expedited shipping is selected. <end>

 B0002V41EI  6mm Collection Quality Japanese Akoya cultured pearl earring studs set in 18K yellow gold ||	  Clean. Simple. Beautiful.  If you are a pearl lover who appreciates quality, by all means look closely at these pearls. They are small enough to be affordable, but still large enough to be noticed and appreciated. The pearls have a lovely deep shine with a rosy hue that you can't really appreciate in the picture. I also like the pearls being set in 18k gold. Why put out the money for nice pearls in lesser quality mountings? I was pleased with the quality and the beauty of these earrings. <end>
 B0002V4698  14K white gold Agatha Freshwater cultured pearl earrings ||	  Nice item!  This is a pair of very nice earrings. Though I expected them to be a little bit bigger as per the picture,but still they are very elegant and romantic. <end>

 B0002VRT10  Elizabethan-Style Large Sterling Silver Rose Quartz and Amethyst Slide Pendant ||	  Love this  I bought this for an anniversary gift for myself (a personal anniversary) and I love it. It is absolutely gorgeous! <end>  Rose quartz pendant  Love this piece! It was a bit larger than I had expected (Amazon, please publish dimensions!!) but it's really pretty. The quartz stone is a bit cloudy...but hey, it's a stone. Great price, and looks great dressed up or casual. <end>  It's beautiful.  I receive so many compliments on this piece when I wear it. It's one of my favorites in my collection. I highly recommend it. <end>
 B0002VRT6K  Sterling Silver Open Wire Amethyst Filigree Pendant ||	  Stunning  This pendant is one of my favorites. The silver is a bit antiqued-looking, which adds to the charm. I got TONS of compliments on this one. <end>

 B0002VRTAG  Pagan or Christian Triquetra Celtic Trinity Knot of the Goddess Sterling Silver Cuff Bracelet 7" ||	  She Loves It  Well designed and finished. Slightly smaller than I thought it would be but she loves it...and that is all that counts. <end>  WOW! A great bracelet  This bracelet was exactly what I was looking for. I had been searching for months and finally found the braclet I wanted. Would buy again. <end>  Gorgeous bracelet!  I just bought this bracelet from someone on ebay for a much cheaper price, and I really lucked out on this. The knot on the front is actually pretty big and easily noticed. The cuff is pretty sturdy and not flimsy or easily broken. It shines up beautifully and is stamped sterling. There are clearly no extra coatings on the silver. The only thing I have to say is if you have small wrists like me, then this will be kind of hanging on the bottom of your wrist a bit, but I really don't mind. It is a bit adjustable and can be squeezed tighter. <end>
 B0002X4P4W  Sterling Silver Marquise Amethyst Drop Chain Necklace ||	  Very Pretty but small...  The pendant is very pretty, but is less than 3/4 of an inch from top to bottom. The stone is purple NOT pink as shown in the picture. <end>
 B0002X4P5Q  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Heart and White CZ Pendant and 16" Chain Necklace ||	  Wonderful!  Wonderful product, high quality, looks like it should have cost $100 or more, came quickly, nice gift box and velvet back came with, no need for wrapping. I would buy again 100%. <end>  Blue Topaz Heart Neckllace Disappoints  I was disappointed with the Blue Topaz necklace. It feels flimzy and doesn't look nearly as nice as the picture. I will be sending it back. <end>  Wife loved it.Wears it everyday  I bought this item for my wife not really knowing what to expect.I went by the review which I read and it looked really nice in the picture.I wasn't disappointed and neither was my wife.She really has not taken it off.She wears it everywhere.The chain is different than it looks,in a good way.Its a petite box chain.Since than I have purchased more from Amazon.I like it cause I don't have to leave the comfort of my home.This is my first review and am writing it because the other reviews have helped me a lot.Thanks again.. <end>  Good but no so good  I bought this for my girlfriend, When the package arrived i pulled out the necklace which i was a little disappointed in.First off the chain is not nearly as pretty as the one in the picture and I guess i had my hopes fo high.Also the camera is at an extremely complementing angle, which also made me a little disappointed when i compared the real necklace with the picture.The necklace is very sturdy(I have already dropped it twice). <end>  A good one.  my darling loved it too much.. its a good gift for to win a women heart ;) <end>  Gift  I thought it was worth the money it cost. Not high dollar gift but fair quality. I would buy this again or if looking for a quick gift. The necklace is a bit too short. <end>  Cute pendant  The color of the stone was great. The chain is not a snake chain described or pictures but more of a box chain. It's still nice I think but is very short. I wasn't paying attention to the 16" length described but that is a very short chain length. <end>
 B0002XLWE8  MLB Boston Red Sox Logo Earrings *SALE* ||	  red soxs earrings  Beware image shows to be silver tone, delievered in cheap gold tone. Seller stated can not always control what comes in. Seller should state that colors may veriy <end>  Boston Red Sox Earrings  This item arrived in great shape and very quickly. The person I gave them to, loves them. <end>  Daughter Loved Them!  My daughter has come to love the Red Sox while watching games with her dad. She saw these as we browsed for Dad's Christmas gift and went wild. They are adorable and well-made. Colors and design look great. A good purchase. <end>  Very Cute Sox Earrings  These earrings are really cute, the price is right and it was very fast shipping. The only thing I found odd about them is that it is like having two left feet so I have two holes in each ear so I wear them both in the same ear so they are going in the same direction. I get plenty of compliments on them. I highly recommend them. <end>  A Good Choice  Eventhough the S&H is alot it's equal to getting these earrings in the red sox fan shop in Boston. I got many complements on them and that alone makes them worth it. <end>
 B0002XYR6S  925 Sterling Silver Solar Blue Jeweled Butterfly Toe Ring ||	  More so for children  The toe ring is pretty, but a stone fell out the day I took it out of the box. I had to super glue it back on. It wears fine, except it turns often, but what toe ring doesn't. This item would look cute as a button on a little girl. <end>  "you get what you pay for"  I just loved this adorable bejewled butterfly toe ring when I saw it online! I'll confess that I wondered how many times I could wear it before one of the little "blue crystals" would fall off, but I did NOT expect it to ARRIVE with only 3 of the 4 small sparklies intact. There's a lot of cute, very inexpensive costume-jewelry out there. This, unfortunately, not only looks cheap, but is made with substandard materials. <end>
 B0002Y50OK  My Little Pony Jewelry Box ||	  It's only alright  I like the jewelry box idea, but this is just not that much fun or all that cute for about $15. The pony itself is good, there's some really cheap "jewelry" that looks more like a hair elastic and it plays music. Sadly, it's not that great. At least the pony amusement park rocks! <end>  Piece of junk!  The jewelry box that comes with this set is a piece of junk. The drawer won't stay in and forget about the clouds staying on. It's pure frustration. Unfortunately, my daughter got it as a birthday gift, and we didn't get a gift receipt, so I didn't even know where it came from. We ended up throwing it away! Don't waste your money! You can buy the pony separately. <end>  Waste of Money  The little extras - like the clouds just fall off. It's not put together well at all. The jewlery is super junky.The pony is cute. I don't even think this is worth the $7.50 it is now! <end>  daughter loves My Little Pony  My daughter loves the My Little Pony collection, so this is a nice addition to what she already has. It's very fun to open the doors with the magnet on the pony's foot. However, if you're looking at this toy as a jewelry box, there really isn't a lot of space for jewelry. Nevertheless, my daughter is happy with it. <end>  Musical Jewelry Box abosolutely fun! - one of best MLP playsets  My daughter loved this set so much and played with it for quite a few years! It was a lot of fun for her .. she loved to store those little rings and hair clips in and out of the cute drawers and sometimes cute little pieces from other playsets; and she has tons of fun using those pieces to decorate her ponies and putting different figures onto the rotating music center creating her stories.. My daughter is 8 now (had the set since 3/4) and still wants to keep her set. After 5 years, our set still works/looks perfectly! I have no idea how other reviewers could have negative experience with it ..We are relocating soon and I was here thinking of selling our used set as a collectible item .. After reading some unfair reviews, I couldn't help to tell our absolute positive experience too! I highly recommend this product. <end>  fun for my daughter  My daughter recieved this for christmas. She really enjoys playing with it. She doesn't care that the clouds fall off or the necklaces are like hair ties. She puts the jewelry on the ponies & likes the music. (...) <end>  poor quality, cute pony  The quality is poor, the clouds keep falling off, cheap jewelry. The pony is cute but you can purchase it without having to get the jewelry box. <end>
 B0002YC2N2  10 KT Yellow Gold Hearts Hoop 10K Earrings with Regular Hoop Closure Findings ||	  10 kt yellow gold hearts hoop earrings with regular hoop closure  The gold hearts hoop earrings are awesome and a very reasonable price. I am very impressed with the earrings. <end>
 B0002YDUQK  Star of David Sphinx Talisman Amulet Pendant Necklace ||	  Powerful  I don't know why you're interested in this product. Are you expecting something magical to happen to your life? If you are guided in this way I would not recommend this product, because it's just some bites of metals and shapes. But if you admire the qualities of Esoteric symbolism and you understand the principle "As above, so below", buy this item. It will bring powerful energies into your life.Note  After some months of usage the David Star image fell apart, but it came back into its place easily. <end>  Star of David on Egyptian Talisman  Very interesting artwork on the talisman. I reserved a special place to display it. <end>
 B0002YDUR4  Medieval Brass Solomon Magic Talisman Pendant Necklace ||	  King Solomon Talisman Pendant Necklace  I wear my Talisman Pendant on a beaded chain (it comes with a leather cord, knotted)which I use for another pendant. This Talisman is for overcoming obsticles. I feel it has inspired me. When I wear it; I become more aware ( catch mistakes, solve problems, & deal with every day matters with a clearer mind). <end>
 B0002YDURY  For Happy Love and Good Friends Medieval Magic Amulet Pendant Necklace ||	  smooth energy  This amulet has a soft, smooth energy to it. Good if you wish to wear something on the "lighter side" of an power amulet. Love the King Solomon reference too. <end>
 B0002YEN52  Major League Baseball Logo Curved Belly Ring - New York Yankees ||	  NY Yankee belly ring  The Yankees symbol came out of the belly ring without me even noticing it and I had only worn it for a week. <end>
 B0002Z43RE  New 10K Two Tone Gold 4mm Ring Diamond-Cut Wedding Band Size 13 ||	  Eve & Steve from PA.  I ordered this ring to replace my old one. This ring came quick and is beautiful. My husband saw the ring & wanted one for himself, so I ordered him one too. This ring is very comfortable to wear & it really sparkles! Also, it is really worth the money. <end>  Just OK  I wanted two weeks before I received the ring. The Ring is rather pretty. But the waiting is too long a time. Hope it could be faster next time! <end>
 B0002Z7M2M  Large Sterling Silver Cherry Quartz Beaded Loop Hoop Earrings ||	  Sterling Silver Peridot Clip On Huggie Hoop Earrings  The earings were great. My Partner loved tham. Thanks for the prompt service. <end>  Perfect bling for my granddaughter ...  Since peridot is her birthstone (August), I bought these earrings for my granddaughter's Sweet Sixteen. They're small and suitable for her. She loves them.The quality is good, and buying them from Amazon certainly beat fighting the crowds at the Mall. (Don't get me wrong; I love shopping malls, too. Those are fun, "girly" outings ... when I have plenty of time and am with a few friends.) <end>
 B0002Z7M36  Sterling Silver Red Garnet Clip On Huggie Hoop Earrings ||	  Great earrings  Wore them the whole holiday and received tons of compliments. A Winner!!! <end>  They are clips  They look really nice - quality silver and pretty design. Only probleb - they are clips, I did not notice it in the description and I can only wear earrings <end>  They Pinch like Crazy!  I got these for my wife. They earrings are beautiful, especially for the price, but they pinch like crazy, really HURTING her ears. Unfortunately, there are no insturctions on how to adjust them, so I did my best, got it too loose, and she lost one! <end>  mismatched  The stones have good color, and the earrings feel substantial. However, one earring had bright, almost white, silver color; while the other was tarnished. I used Wright's Silver Polish which helped except for the crevices. <end>
 B0002Z7M4K  4cttw Genuine Peridot Curved Bar Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  decent price, not so comfy  These earrings are beautiful, and match the 5 stone ring that I received from the same company very well, but they are not so comfortable. The backs are hinged/spring-loaded, and fit very tightly. That's nice for reassurance that they won't fall off, but one of my two earrings is almost excruciatingly painful to wear. The other is not quite as tight.Overall, they're so pretty that I'm going to keep them and hope they loosen up a little. <end>  Sturdy, Pretty  These Italian design earrings are comfortable and built to last. You'll have no regrets on this purchase. <end>
 B0002Z7M5Y  Sterling Silver Grey HEMATITE Poison Box Ring size 4.5(Size 6) ||	  Cool Novelty!  I love this ring! It looks great and feels comfortable! I love the hematite stone - gives the ring a more gothic look. It matches my charm bracelet where all the charms open up to reveal something inside. These rings are a cool novelty and fun to wear! <end>  Gorgeous Hematite Poison ring in Sterling Silver  I love this ring, but I had not realized when I put it in my Wish List that the ring is a size 4. I wear a size 6. I don't think it can be sized up two sizes without stress or damage to the ring so I am removing this item from my Wish List. Too bad, beause I love it! <end>
 B0002Z7M6I  Sterling Silver Spinning Knot Chain Spin Ring Size 5.5(Size 6.5,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Love it!  It's an absolutely wonderful ring. Feels great against the skin and doesn't itch the fingers beside it. The section for the celtic knots spins within the base of the ring. It has to be my favorite. Will have to keep checking in to see if the product gets restocked, though. I lost it in some bathroom when I was washing my hands. <end>  Great ring and quality product  I recieved this as a gift for a friend. It is a very sturdy and weighted ring, it very smoothly spins, and has a nice finnish to it. <end>  Spinning Ring  I'll be honest. I don't care much for this ring (personal taste), but my husband (the one who bought and wears it) loves it and has worn it everyday since the day he got it. It's lightweight and the chain pattern in the middle of the ring actually rotates, i.e. "spins". He's constanly playing with it.The ring itself is still like the day he bought it, several months ago, and it has not tarnished or rubbed off in anyway. So I suppose it's worth the purchase. <end>  Dissapointed, and returned  This is a review of the product only - all interactions with the retail company were fantastic. I bought this ring based on the picture and reviews - however the reality was much different. The ring is extremely lightweight - and as a man, I prefer my jewelry with a solid, substantial feel. The detail on the chain was quite poor and at times individual links were melted into the other. The black contrast is not as significant or shiny as the picture conveys, and as a result of the chain being free to rotate, the ring makes a slight "tinkling" sound as your hand is moved. Return was accomplished quite easily using the original packaging and $2 for S&H and the credit was applied within 3 business days of receipt confirmation. <end>  cheap quality  cheap quality.. I don't recommend it. The spinning section wiggles and you grow tired of it, about 2 minutes after wearing it <end>  Good, quick delivery!  The ring was exactly as it was pictured. The size fit well and delivery was quick.Thanks! <end>  sterling silver ring  I was very satisfied with the product. They were very prompt in getting it to me and it was exactly what I ordered. <end>

 B0002Z7MDG  Sterling Silver WIDE Roman Ribbed Band Ring Size 6(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  In great detail.  This ring is a marvelous silver replica. If you look at it with a magnifying glass, you'll see all the little ornaments are crafted in detail, like the strings of minuscule dots on either side of the ring.When the ring gets a little tarnished, don't use a silver cleaner but take a soft cloth and rub the ring carefully. <end>  antique ring  This was a great ring. It looks just like the picture. I get compliments all the time. <end>
 B0002Z7MIQ  Mourie Sterling Silver Celtic Birth Charm Tree Pendant for August 17 - September 8 ||	  Healing Tree  Very pretty and delicate-looking (the pendant is the size of an American quarter). It's simple enough that I can wear it every day and far less attention grabbing than my pentacle. The clean lines and artful style, though, make it appropriate for any religion. <end>  pleased!  Shipping was very fast (impressed since it's getting close to Christmas!). The pendant is very pretty, looks just like picture! <end>  best charm ever!  I have had this charm for 4 years now and it looks just as good as it did the day I got it. It really stands up to the test of time and wear. I recommend this charm to anyone who loves trees and the symbolism behind them. This one symbolizes healing, and for me it has helped me heal and grow as I have worn it over the years. <end>  Great charm  I wear this pendant all the time, it's a beautiful design. The only thing I'd change is to make the ring a bit tighter, so it doesn't jingle. For the price though - it's definitely worth it. <end>  A beautiful piece of wearable art!  I ordered this for myself, and I couldn't be happier. The image is nicely rendered, and a nice size, not too big, not too small. It was promptly shipped and nicely packaged, with a nice history of all of the Celtic symbols enclosed. <end>

 B0002Z7NI0  Southwestern Multi Stone Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  They're ok  These are very beautiful earrings. They're much smaller than I expected, not sure the measurements are correct on the description. I feel like I overpaid a bit, but I'm still happy with them for the most part <end>  Great colors !  These are a perfect size and hang well. The colors are a rich, deep hue. Wonderful !!! <end>
 B0002Z7YZW  Sterling Silver and Red Resin Pendant ||	  This business does not deliver!  I never received the product.

Today is Jan 16, 2007 and I have not received the product or even heard from this outfit. <end>
 B0002ZFZU8  Pugster Cupid Charm Gift Winter Sale Jewelry Bracelet ||	  Pugster Christian Charm Bracelet  Pugster Christian Charm Bracelet ( Cross Teacher Dangle Religious Beaded )I didn't get these on sale. Not worth full price. Cute, but oxidizes very quickly, and should not be worn by anybody who has nickel allergy. <end>
 B0002ZG034  Pugster Dragonfly Charm Bracelet ||	  Expensive shipping... bracelet is nice...  The quality is alright considering the price of the bracelet. The bracelet itself is a stretchy bracelet, the stretchy comes from a clear elastic like material the beads are threaded onto. The beads themselves were a little spotty and needed some polishing before I felt good about giving it as a gift. The dragonfly charms are cute, not the highest quality but cute anyway. The bracelet is made in China.I paid for priority shipping and it did arrive quickly, but not by any priority carrier. The package ( a plain envelope, the bracelet inside wrapped with a tiny single piece of bubble wrap) arrived by REGULAR USPS mail and the stamp on the envelope says 60 cents was the cost. Since the packaging was not anything fancy (barely adequate in my opinion) I am wondering what the very expensive priority shipping cost was for, other to make sure they send it out in a reasonable time frame. I had intended to order other products from this company but after paying a VERY overpriced S & H fee I will not buy from them again. <end>
 B0002ZG67E  Pugster Arial Black Font Sissy Laser Italian Charms ||	  Great Buy  This charm came exactly as described and was a great reward for a young girl I work with. This is the nickname her little sister calls her. The charm was shiny and printed as ordered. <end>
 B0002ZGRNM  1.5 Carat Platinum Sapphire and Diamond Ring (Closeout) ||	  Blue-black sapphire in platinum at a bargain price  This is a heavy, solid ring, suitable for office wear yet glamorous enough for evening. The pav&eacute; diamonds are understated and the sapphire fits within the width of the band.The sapphire is very dark, with very little "fire," which undoubtedly contributes to the low price. At the "full price" listed for this piece (which would be a major outlay) I would probably lower this rating. However, at the "closeout price" (similar to a plain band ring in platinum) it made a great gift.Kudos to Secure Hoop, who went out of their way to devise a very nice gift wrap and to assure delivery. <end>
 B0002ZJBYE  Sterling Silver Peridot, Garnet, Amethyst, Blue Topaz and Citrine Individually Boxed Stud Earring Set ||	  Lovely stones but big setting  While the price was terrific and the colors of the stones were beautiful, the setting juts out too far. The earrings droop. Even with a flat disc back I thought too much of the setting showed and dwarfed the stones. <end>  Unbelievably Good Deal  I was a little reluctant to buy these after reading some of the reviews, but I am very glad I did. I have super-short hair so they really show, and their high profile isn't a problem. The stones are gorgeous, better than I expected. They come individually boxed, so you can buy them and if you don't like them you've got five expensive-looking gifts to give. <end>  Sterling Silver Peridot, Garnet, Amethyst, Blue Topaz & Citrine Stud Earring Set  Great value, quality and craftsmanship; back-up with excellent service!The stones are clear and brilliant.Thanks!R. Caspers5 out of 5 stars...Jewelry <end>  Impressed  I bought these for my wife for Christmas. I was hoping that it would be well receieved. She makes her own jewelry and as an eye for it.When she opened up all the boxes, she couldn't put them down! She loves all of them and is very, very happy with the brillance, cut, and setting of each one. She's especially happy to have a range of colors to match her different outfits!A great find and buy! <end>  Too Small  From the pictures I expected a more substantial setting for all the earrings. The earrings look small and the details of the setting are lost. I already have better sets and will be returning these. <end>  Earings  These are really nice. The Peridot gem is about 1/2 cm in diameter, and the others are about the same size. Perfect. <end>  Cloudy peridot  These earrings are very pretty, the citrines being my favorite, but the peridot earrings are cloudy and look like cheap plastic. I was very disappointed but I love all the other earrings and I don't know if I can return just one pair so I guess I'm stuck with them. <end>  Great Value and Product for the Price  Am always borrowing certain color earrings from my daughter and then realized neither of us had any blue gemstone earrings. Instead of going shopping at a store where I knew I would pay more than I wanted, I checked Amazon. Am also hesitant to buy jewelry online as I like to see what I am getting. But after reading all the reviews, I decided to order this set. I am very happy as I have things to wear every color with!! My daughter also loved them and immediately borrowed the blue ones to wear!! Another thing I like about this set is that each pair has a different shape to the gemstones. Often see sets with different colors in the stores around Christmas but they are all the same size and shape. I like having them be different. Where else could I get five different pair of earrings for this price?? Will be wearing them often and loaning them to my daughter as well. <end>  some items OK  Blue topaz is practically colorless. Amethyst is a bit paler than on the photo, other items are nice. Overall I am satisfied because the price is OK even if I get only 3 out of 5 which are useful. <end>  Excellent for the price point!!  Five sets of large stud earrings for $45. Great deal. For you jewelry afficiandos, the stone coloring may be a bit pale on some of the sets, but I think this will very from set to set. I personally loved them and the bling size. I would definitely purchase as a gift for someone who loves stud earrings. <end>  oversized mounting  The pictures of these earrings are beautiful, but deceptive. The mountings are huge and heavy making the earrings hang low. The studs do NOT want to sit squarely on the earlobe, but fall downward. The mountings are WAY too large/tall for the stones. I had to return them because they look terrible on. <end>  Thrilled With Beautiful Jewelry and Great Deal!!!  One of the things I love about Amazon is the ability to read a review before you buy.The reviews on these earrings are right on target. I'm so glad I bought them!The cut, color, clarity, and shape of the stones are excellent. As illustrated the cuts are different for each pair, that's a nice touch. So far I have worn all but the Blue Topaz and I've received compliments on all of them.My good friend playfully grabbed my earlobe when I wore the Citrine set and said, "Hmm, I thought you were on a budget...looks like that resolution didn't take." Hahahah, I am on a budget, if she only knew how much I paid for them. I actually bought these with my new allowance, best money ever spent.She also thought they were platnium, I just smiled and shrugged my shoulders. One thing you might not catch from the pictures, these are nice sized stones. They are large and in charge and definitely going to get noticed.This would make a great gift in part or whole. Better yet, buy them for yourself, it's the best deal you'll ever get on jewelry. <end>  Beautiful, but not what I expected  These earrings are beautiful. My only problem with them is that I am giving them as a gift and I was disappointed with the packaging. The earrings were shipped in plain unmarked boxes with no product description(sterling silver, genuine stone,ie). The description said that they would be shipped in a "Regal blue sueded cloth". Not the case. I am giving these to a teenager, I hope she doesn't think there cheap! <end>  Too Beautiful but Too Big  The stones in these earrings are stunning. Good cut and quality, lovely colors to go with your entire wardrobe. However, the settings are so large and stand out from my earlobe so far that you can't see the stones, just the silver setting. I'm sure it's a combination of the size of the earring and the shape of my ear, but I'm really disappointed that I don't wear these lovely little gems as much as I had intended. If you have larger earlobes perhaps these would be the perfect studs for you. But if you have smaller ears, beware. <end>  Holy Moly are these larger than I expected. - LOL  They are very solidly made. A few of the backs were slightly bent, but I was able to straighten them. They are just much larger than I anticipated. <end>  Studs for your wardrobe  As I get older, I find that I prefer smaller earrings and sometimes, a stud is all I want to wear. I have wanted these earrings for a while but finally broke down and bought them earlier this month. I have to say that I am more than delighted by them. The silver settings are quite pretty. The color of the stones is vibrant.A couple reviews indicated that they are too heavy so, when I ordered the earrings, I also orderedEarring Stabilizers. It was a good decision. When I first took a pair out of the box, I immediately noticed the weight. They are substantial. The earring stabilizer held the earring straight and did not let the weight of the earring make my earlobe droop. Nobody wants droopy earlobes.I do not recommend considering these earrings for those second and third holes. They are simply too heavy for that. <end>  Don't be fooled by negative reviews  When I purchased these earrings as a gift for my wife, I was very concerned about the negative reviews. Despite the majority of reviews being very positive, a few key negative reviews indicated how large the settings were and how much they might make a woman's earlobes "droop."I can safely say they were completely off on this one. My wife is very thin and has delicate features. The earrings look amazing on her, and there is none of the problems pointed out in the negative reviews.The quality of the gems is beautiful, as well. The colors match the images, and in many cases, the images actually don't do the gems justice. Some have complained about the garnet being too dark, but I found the garnets were a beautiful deep red. Actually lighter than in the photos.If you are purchasing these earrings for someone over the age of 80, then maybe I would say buyer beware. Otherwise, please buy these as a gift for someone. They will love them <end>  Beautiful stones and settings, perfect size  Over the years, I had gotten away from wearing earrings in the second piercing of my double-pierced ears. But now, I wear a pair of these almost every day, with dangly ones in the first piercing. (My dad asked me when I got my ears double-pierced. The answer  24 years ago! LOL!)The stones are a nice size, and the settings make the earrings interesting without being complicated. I don't think they sit out too far from the ear; in fact, the settings allow lots of light to sparkle through the stones.Every stone is beautiful and crystal clear. Even the garnets are red and clear, with little or no brown in them.I'm very pleased with the earrings in this set and highly recommend them, especially for a buyer (or "giftee") with double-pierced ears. <end>  Real gemstones set in sterling silver. Make a great gift!  The best thing about these earrings are that these are real gemstones. The shapes and colors are beautiful. The size is big for stud earrings, between 5mm-8mm depending on cut (about 1 carat diamond size). They are nicely cut, and sparkle in your ears. As others commented, the setting is high so they are best viewed from the front. If you have really tiny and thin earlobes then these will be too big and may droop a little. If you're going for the delicate look, then these will probably not meet your expectations with the high setting and the bigger size. I think they're not very suitable for tweens but may be ok for an older teenager.They come in a long satin blue box which has individual boxes inside so you can gift these away to 5 different people if you like. <end>  A great gift!  I bought this set for my wife as a valentine's day gift. She really liked them! They are a good size and color, so they give a striking impression from a distance. The earrings come in little plastic ziplock bags all packed inside a not too special velvety bag. If you purchase this as a gift, go the extra step and get something to make a better presentation. I went to wally-world and bought a $3 wooden jewelry box, which conveniently enough had a heart-shaped decorative glass in the top. It was well received. <end>  Colors very light or too dark, but good overall value  Well made, but colors were a bit dissapointing. The garnet is almost black. Still a good value for the money. <end>  Excellent Earrings for the Cost  These earrings were an excellent buy that offer a lot color choices. They seem to be well made with backs that fit well. <end>  Sterling Silver Peridot, Garnet, Amethyst, Blue Topaz and Citrine...  The stones matched the circle pendant purchased separately very nice. My wife loves it. Gives various color options with the pendant. Product delivered in time before Christmas. Thankyou. <end>  Very pretty  What a great set of stud earrings. I love the colors of these earrings. the pictures do these little justice. what a surprise. <end>  A very good purchase  I love this combination of earrings. I bought this for myself and I love each pair, each for their own value. Each is a unique shape-and fairly substantial in content. The colors of most of the gems is very bright- bright green for the peridot; rich gold for the citron; clear red for the garnet...the blue is light medium for the blue topaz , but the amethyst is in the pink-lavender range, not bad but not really the purple one might think of for amethyst. Each stone in the earring is a nice size for an earring...it sits nicely in the middle of an earlobe and does not weigh heavily or lean forward when wearing it. I also have to add, in these days when many of us are buying jewelry with sterling silver instead of gold because of the economy, each pair of earrings comes with a little anti-tarnish sheet in its individual box, to keep it fresh. I think that is a nice touch. I have yet to see any tarnish in my pieces, and I think it will help. As some have mentioned in previous reviews, each pair of earrings come in their own special box, and they are perfect if one wants to give each pair separately. Again, I love all of these earrings as they are a great addition to my wardrobe and I plan to wear them all because they are comfortable and way cute! <end>  Beautiful earrings!!!  Wow!!!! These earrings were a bargain - $50 for five pair of beautiful gemstone earrings. I paired them with the matching necklaces for beautiful gift sets! <end>  Beautiful collection of ear studs  I purchased this set for myself when it appeared on Amazon's Lightning Deals shortly before Christmas. The stones and the settings in this collection are beautiful and appear to be of very high quality. I was concerned that the posts on these earrings might be too short (I have had this experience quite often when purchasing less expensive earrings) --- happily the posts are of sufficient length! The earrings are comfortable and secure! <end>  Big smile  I gave them to my daughter for Christmas and she loved them. Her first real jewelry. The biggest smile was on her face. <end>  Wonderful gift...  Great quality. Well received. The recipient went crazy over them. I am thrilled the recipient was happy. A happy homekeeper is a warm home keeper. <end>  every setting is different  these are so much fun... i have them to give whenever i need a special birthstone gift. all the settings were a bit different and that made it fun... settings and stones are very nicely done... and what a great price! <end>  Great Value for the Set  The earrings arrived 2 or 3 days after I bought them when they were on sale with the gold box special. They were a great value. My only complaint was that the blue topaz and the purple amethyst were very light in color. <end>  Beautiful an Classy!  I love how each pair of earrings comes in its own box. They are all beautiful and unique. It's not like all five pair of earrings are set the same way. The colors are magnificent. I would be happy getting these as a gift, and I think they make a great gift to give. I will continue to look for these to go on sale again. I am 100% pleased with this purchase. <end>  great deal  These were an early Christmas present and the wife loved them. There's not much to say really. You get exactly what's pictured bundled in plain little cardboard jewelry boxes. <end>  Couldn't be happier!  I ordered these for our daughter's 21st birthday and they will be a fantastic gift. I bought them on Black Friday, so they were less expensive than the price that they are listed at now, but even at the higher price they are well worth it. They are the perfect size for studs and look way more expensive than what I paid for them. I will probably get a set for myself, again, even at this higher price. Pay the extra for two-day shipping and get them for someone for a Christmas gift...guaranteed they won't be disappointed. <end>  great price  Great Deal! Would recommend buying product. earrings are a great size not too big or small. <end>  earring set  LOVELY Earrings, can't beat them for the price. Each is individually boxed and if you don't wantall of them for yourself, they make lovely stocking stuffers or little thoughtful gifts too.They are a bit weighty, and the stones are a VERY respectable size. Those with thin earlobes maychoose to obtain those backs with the wide plastic "donut" to keep them straight and stabilize them.The stones are lovely, settings are quality and the price is unbeatable. I would suggest thatAmazon offer a wire dangle version of these as well for those with thin ears, or for those who have doublepiercing and like to wear coordinating designs...I'd bet they'd sell like hotcakes! <end>  Nice.  The earrings are nice. Two of them had slightly bent back parts, but that's easily fixable. They're nice looking too. The red is really dark, so it'll appear more as a black when you have it on. Looks nice anyways. Good deal. <end>  excellent quality!  I bought these earrings to pass along as Mothers Day gifts. But I did keep all but one pair, they are so pretty! The stones are a good size, not too large, not too small. They are clear and sparkly and not cheap looking at all. They dont droop on my ears at all, like a previous person said they did. A terrific deal! <end>  GORGEOUS!  These earrings just arrived, and they're GORGEOUS! They're larger than I thought they'd be; the stones are about 1/4" at their widest point, and the round peridots are just a bit smaller. I ordered them as gifts for some of my nieces, and it will hard to part with them. Time to order another set for Auntie! <end>  beautiful  Loved these earrings. The stones were larger than I expected and very clear. The amethyst is a little pale but still a lovely color. <end>  Nice for the price  I really like stud earrings and have always wanted ones with gemstones but didn't want to pay the price. These are good for the price you pay for them. They aren't as vibrant as the pictures and the setting is a little thin but I like them and wear them alot. <end>  Lovely.  Very nice earrings. Had no problem with drooping. Like that they are single packed to that I can give some as gifts. Great gold box price. Do wish they said they were genuine stones. <end>  Huge  These earings are actually very pretty. They are not as brillent as in the photos though. My main problem is they do not specify a size so you really don't know what your getting until you get them. They are HUGE especially the yellow ones. Much too big for my liking. <end>  Fabulous Bargain!  This is an amazing price for 5 pair of nicely sized genuine gemstone earrings. Whether you keep all 5 pair for yourself, or break up the set to give as gifts, it is a terrific buy. I am very pleased with my purchase and wear a pair nearly every day. The stones are cut in different shapes and are in substantial settings. They were a gift to myself for having begun an exercise program that I am diligently sticking to. A nice reward. <end>  Really Good Deal  I waas about to by a necklace and pendant for my GF when I received this suggestion from amazon. She really likes the set and I'm sure that I earned one more point in our relationship. This was very cheap as well <end>  Individually boxed stud earring set  These were a great buy and fun to wear. They go with so many outfits. The only problem being - had I known they were made in China I wouldn't have bought them. <end>  Good "Go-With-Everything Set"  Switch the backs for the disk-type, round backs and there is absolutely no problem with how the earring is oriented on the ears (referring to previous reviews). <end>  nope  Did not like I returned them, beware look pretty but, not at all, watch out, delelivery was okay but nothing else. <end>  Not impressed  My daughter doesn't seem to be wearing them and when I showed her the picture she dosn't remember getting them, so I guess she wasn't impressed. I don't think they cost very much, and that looks like a good thing now. <end>  What do you expect for the price?  While the earrings were in perfect condition, they had no brilliance to them. They're not brilliant like the photos show. I can't imagine what I was thinking when I ordered them, $10 per pair of earrings for a successful attorney! If you don't have much money, they're a good deal, but I wouldn't use them as a gift. I felt so stingy afterwards that I returned them. <end>  Wonderful Gift Item  I purchased four sets of these earings for my nieces this Christmas. They absolutely loved them. They range in ages from 10-14 and they couldnt have been happier. They are the perfect price point so you wont feel to bad if they lose them. They quality of the stones is good, as is the matching of the colors. The silver work is very nice as well. <end>  Lovely Earrings  I received my five different studded earring sets and am thrilled. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the clarity and cut of the stones. Everything I had hoped for and more than I expected. <end>  No Regrets  This was my first jewelry purchase through the internet. You won't regret owning these high quality gemstone earrings. Being an RN, I can't wear hoops or dangly earrings at work - these work great and I can easily match all my scrubs with them. They really stand out and are an excellent accent for all occasions! You will love them too! <end>  Very nice  I liked that they weren't all round. Colors are very nice. I would recommend these to anyone that likes alot of different colors. <end>  Awesome Earrings@  I love these earrings and everything about them. They are beautiful gems and the &#34;filigree&#34; is lovely too. They fit nicely on my ears and they do not hang down if you put the back on tight enough. (Other reviews complain about them being top heavy.) A great buy! <end>  Excellent deal!  These are amazing earrings ~ love all the colors & different shapes of the stones ~ so comfortable to wear! <end>  Daughter really liked em.  Of the several gifts I made to my daughter, she seemed to like these best. Go figure! They are very nice for the price; and with several to choose from they were a hit. She also received the matching necklace collection, so they made a nice set. <end>  Love them  For me, the earrings are just the right size and I like all the colors. I would like to see then offered in more colors. <end>  Really quite beautiful  Incredible product for an incredible price, very attractive I really love them...Thank you so much for such a wonderful product. <end>  Great  They are good quality earrings and I really love them. They made a great Christmas gift and added some nice pieces to my earring collection. <end>  way more bang for your buck with this set  i hinted that i wanted this set for my birthday after reading all the great reviews. thankfully my boyfriend pays attention & thankfully all the rave reviews were spot on. all the earrings are gorgeous & look very expensive. they are not dinky little stones, and are nice size. i am considering ordering another set so that i can give a pair or two to my neices as seperate gifts. you could def break up the set & use them for several occasions. i am just lucky enough to have a whole set to myself! great value for stunning earrings. <end>  Beautiful earrings!  I love this earrings. They are very elegant, shine and very well made, the shapes are very nice and the settings too  ) <end>  Amazing  Are you kidding me? These are fantastic! The price is almost too good to be true. They arrived in 5 separate boxes. The stones are substantial and gorgeous. Will definitly buy from this seller again, quality earrings!!!!! <end>  More Substantial than I Thought  I bought this set for my 14-year-old niece for Christmas. They came individually boxed, then in a sleeve. I wrapped each box separately so it would be fun for her to open five gifts instead of one--and she said it was really fun to open each one and see a different color inside.My niece wanted stud earrings because she plays sports, has long hair, and it's more her personality. The size of the gems were larger than I thought they would be, and the colors were quite nice. I remember at her age it was especially fun to select my jewelry for the day. With five different colors, it provides plenty of options.I gave my niece a jewelry box last year, so she has someplace to store these. In addition, she had on her holiday list an earring tree or jewelry pouch for her locker.I did order the earring stabilizers (about $5) as recommended. I may order some for myself as well. <end>  OK for the price  They are OK for the price. A bit clunky and bulky, They kind of droop - seem a bit "top heavy" but not to the extent another revewier described. I won't be heartbroken if I loose one like I would if it was a really expensive stone, so it works for me for "every day" wear. <end>  Studtastic  4 of the 5 were perfect, 1 pair butterfly backing didn't fit properly. Worth the money! <end>  Fantastic!  These are all the best of what everyone has already said. We purchased them for our daughter's 11th birthday. They are beautiful. I am keeping the Garnets for myself, they are the darkest of the lot. The colors vary from a pale blue of the topaz to the vibrant green and golden lemony yellow of the citrine and peridot. The stones are very clear with no visible flaws and the setting is a pretty little filagree look. These are an EXCELLENT set. I HIGHLY recommend them. <end>  Fabulous  Ear rings were for my daughter and they were beautiful. She also received the matching necklaces from another relative. So classy. <end>  Beautiful, Good Quality  These beautiful stud earrings came packaged together in individual boxes, which was perfect for gift giving. Between my mom and sisters, we split up the five earrings and have all been pleased with the quality and color. The different shapes allow for some variety and the colors are true to the photos. I would recommend this set as a good buy (earring set at less than $10 each) and for the quality and variety of the earrings in the set. <end>  Good earrings for the price  Like the size and color of these earrings. Allows a nice variety of colors for the price. <end>  Wish the basket setting could have been lower.  I bought these earrings in 2008 and they are still like new now. The shapes and colors of gems go with whatever you wear. My only complaint is the basket setting is kinda high which makes the earrings look bulky from sides and drop easily. <end>  Go-to earring set.  The good  Love this set, very pretty very basic. Stones are good-sized with no inclusions. The decorative metalwork is pretty and not cumbersome. The picture is dead on for what you get. The stones in my set do not have inclusions and are a decent size & cut. The backings grip tightly, and there are two grooves as opposed to the standard one to prevent the backings from slipping off even if they do relinquish their death grip on the the post.The bad  My only complaint are that the colors are faint, and my garnets are brownish. But then, consider the cost and that the brownish-ness is included in the description. So I can't quibble over this, as buyer is notified in advance.The ugly  No ugly. The product is solid and the description is accurate.The last word  Worth it for a good basic set that you can afford to lose singles from. Goes with everything, just be aware that it won't be top quality, intensely colored gems. I rated it 5 stars because they are exactly what the description states and I am not at all dissatisfied. <end>  Nice quality  These earrings are very nice quality and described accurately. However, as mentioned before, very heavy. So if can't tolerate heavy earrings, these aren't for you. <end>  Sterling silver Peridot Garnet Amethyst Blue Topez and Citrine Individually Boxed Stud Earring Set  This was a great buy. One of the best sets I have seen in quite sometime. The settings for each earring set was very nice and each set was different. The stones were brite and clear which sometimes is overlooked due to cost. These look like I had paid much more than I did. I gave away the sets as gifts and everyone was delited to get them. I see them being worn all the time. My grand-daughter got the Garnet set, and as with most kids does not like anything, but was delighted with these and wears them all the time. Size is not a problem they are small but have big shine and because they each come in there own box they can be one gift or five. I am saving money on the gift giving with this and making points by giving them. <end>  Colors not as pictured.  The colors were not as shown in the picture. We didn't get a blue topaz stone; instead we got a dark, almost, emerald green stone. The other stones are just not a deep in color as shown. The earrings appeared to be well set and not loose in the setting. All in all, we were pleased based upon price and content. <end>  Casual wear, great!  I like to match my earrings to my outfits on casual days and these are great for that. They have a classy look to them and I get compliments on them. They sparkle and are not too big or too small.They were a good price on Amazon! <end>  Pleasantly Surprised  I purchased these on a lightning deal for $35. They are for a birthday present. The stones look very clear and the colors are good. They are a little larger than I thought. Nice size stones. I would have believed someone if they told me that they paid $35 for each pair. We'll see how she likes them tomorrow. <end>  durable, and wonderful value  I bought these earrings for myself over two years ago and still love them. All the stones are brightly colored and well sized. My personal favorite are the Citrine. I have no problems with the earrings sitting awkwardly as some have noted. I keep the backing as close to my ear as possible without discomfort, and have not found them to tilt. I am 23 and have rather small ears and earlobes, but then again everyone is different. I think these were a great value then, and still are! They all came in little separate boxes that could have been used for gifting, but these were a gift for myself. <end>  Terrific Buy!  I just recieved these earrings and they are all stunning. Really not too big and they sit on my ears perfectly. I really was wary after reading some of the other reviews but took the chance and I am very glad I did. Everything about them are perfect. What a awesome price. I feel like I should have paid more. Very happy with these! They came in separate gift boxes and ready to give as individual gifts, but I plan on keeping them all, they are so lovely. <end>  Very nice  Cute earrings, great price! I like the choice of colors, and the fact that each pair comes in a seperate box, which is a great idea for gift giving. These are heavier, not tiny, so they show up great. Some reviews state that these do not work well with some lobes, but I am lucky that I am able to wear earrings without sagging or drooping. I do have sensitvie ears, and have been able to wear them all day & night without any irritation. My ears are double pierced, these work well in either site. <end>  Great for the price  These are certainly not subtle; the stones are medium-sized and very prominent. The prongs appear very sturdy, and I don't expect them to come off for a long time, which makes them ideal for day-to-day wearing. <end>  Good for the price  I ordered this set on deal of the day, and I figured that the stones would be cloudy and not clear. When they arrived I was very surprised at how clear and clean all my stones were. My only issue is one earring had a back that was broken, I wasn't too concerned since I usually switch the backs out to plastic ones so they are more comfortable and secure.I kept 2 pair for myself, and the other 3 I gave as gifts. When you do the math, 7 dollars a pair is the best deal any where! So for the small issue 4 stars, if not for that I'd give 5.I haven't had any issues with the earrings drooping, as others mentioned, on my ears nor any of the recipients. I think it is just a matter of where your ears were pierced on your ear lobe (like how centered, or how low, etc.) that can make them droop. They are not heavy for me at all, I really like them. They are a pretty good size, so for a child they may be too large. I gave one pair to my 16 year old niece, and she was thrilled, especially being her birthstone (november/citrine) and they were the perfect size for her.I would order these again for gifts even at the full price. <end>  Stud Gemstone Earrings are the Best!  I bought this set over a year ago and I love it. They are great for trips and everyday use. The silver is so good and the posts never bend. What a great value. <end>  gemstone earrings  Loved the quality and different cuts on each different gemstone but wished they were individually boxed or mounted on an earring card for nicer gift giving purposes. <end>  Nice earrings, but packaging is lacking.  I bought these for my niece for Christmas because I thought they were a nice versatile set, but not too flashy for an 11 yr old. I am very pleased with the appearance of the earrings, but was a bit disappointed in the packaging. They come in a box, within a bag, but each pair is in a little plastic zip loc bag. These could really look much more appealing if they were presented a little better. Still, I think they were a good deal. <end>  Very Happy with the Earrings  I am very happy with these earrings. I had seen them on Amazon Christmas 2005 and dropped the hint to my boyfriend, but they were sold out. So, for an early birthday present this year, he gave these to me, since I had again dropped the hint after seeing that they were back in stock.I was quite pleasantly surprised by the size of the stones. I was expecting something smaller. They list the carat weight, but unless you are dealing in carats all day, I don't think one can really grasp the true dimensions (at least I didn't).The setting is not on the flimsy side and the posts are strong as far as I can tell. The backs fit snugly and do not lop over like some earring backs do. I would highly recommend these for a gift for a loved one, or for yourself. <end>  Product Quality Had Plummeted  Original Review  Five StarsUsually when buying jewelry online, the product looks more glittering and larger that actual. Not the case here. The stones are great quality and sizeable. Each pair comes it a sharp looking black jewelry box. I gave the few as gifts and every recipient was happy! I particularly like the blue topaz.Review Update  April 28th, 2012, Two StarsI bought this product again and received it yesterday (April 27th, 2012). The product quality has gone down and it is now manufactured in China, as oppose to Canada where the first set that I purchased was made. I was very disappointed in this change of quality, as I was hoping to give these out as nice gifts for a trip abroad to Asia tomorrow. Now they are going back to Amazon. One thing I noticed from this experience and from another experience buying from Amazon is that when sorting by "popularity" which I often used, the most popular product with the most reviews aren't always the best. Some products seem to have been around for years and have garnered hundreds for good reviews, but perhaps to accommodate demand, the manufacturer moved the product manufacturing to a low cost country, significantly altering the quality of the product. I recommend reading and putting priority on the "latest, most current reviews", as oppose to old reviews, as product quality can change over the years. Perhaps this product became a victim of its own success. <end>  Decent earrings  The stones are very nice and the settings are decent quality, but I agree with other reviewers who have noted that they stick out rather far on the earlobes. The settings are just too deep, and it gives them a rather awkward look when worn--to my eyes anyway. They're not really bad, but just not anything special. If you don't mind the deep setting, then they are pretty good quality for the money when you can get them at Gold Box prices. <end>  Suprisingly More Beautiful Than Imagined  I got these on a Gold Box deal, well worth it. These gems in their settings were a lot better than I thought they would be. You have to be cautious when purchasing jewelry on line.The Amethyst does seem a bit pink more than purple, which I kind of liked better. The Garnet does appear to be more orange than a dark red. The other stones are true to color.I have thick lobes and I do think the posts are very thin and very long. I usually don't have the problem of getting poked by earrings when lying down or talking on the phone but that is common with these.I am giving 4 stars for the color that is off and for the extra long/thin posts. I suppose if you have really fat lobes the length would be great.I do recommend these as they make great gifts. They come in individual little black jewelry boxes. <end>  Beautiful stones and settings.  I just got these earrings for Xmas and they are so pretty! The other reviewers are right that they are a bit heavy in their deep settings, but perhaps the earring backs with the discs would help those people who have trouble with them drooping. The earrings work okay for me. The stones are clear and beautiful and the settings are very pretty and scroll-like. I love that they're all different shapes. A good value! <end>  Cheap, but that's my little secret!!!  I got these as a lightning deal to round out my personal jewelry collection. I wasn't sure what to expect at this price point, but when the sets arrived I was pleasnatly surprised. These are much better quality that what you would normally find for this price.The stones shine brilliantly with an impressive size and weight. The color and clarity of the stones are also impressive. The only shortcoming are the garnets - they look more like a dull brown than the rich, deep red pictured and sparkle noticeably less than the others. I probably won;t wear the garnets too often for that reason. That being said, I still feel that my money was well spent.I bought the matching pendant collection as well, but honestly the earrings look just as beautiful worn alone or with a second set of earrings (I like them worn with sterling silver hoops). <end>  Not a Jewelry Expert  I ordered these as a gift. The red stones on the earrings do not match. One is considerably darker than the other and doesn't reflect light (sparkle) very much. The yellow stones are slightly lighter than what is in the amazon pic. Still, the set at the holiday price is a good deal. The earrings are marked 925, and they appear to be of good quality (other than the forementioned). I could return them to Amazon, but I will just gift the set minus the red pair. I think the recipient will very happy with the gift. <end>  Beautiful for gift giving  When I first ordered these, it arrived short of the Citrine, immedietely, the seller responded and resent another package, andI received the reorder within a week. These are beautiful stones set in gift boxes ready to give. I am giving a set of earringsto each salon gal I visit on a regular basis all year. These are truly genuine and a wonderful buy for gift giving. <end>  Great size and cut  My only complaint is the peridot. It is cloudy. All the other stones were clear and brilliant. Flat backs would have been best. <end>  Totally worth it!  Finally! Something that's worth its price! I have bought a lot of jewelries online and I've come to accept that most of them do not appear as good as the photos but this one is just extraordinary! The gems don't look a small as I expected them to be and it even looks better when worn. Each of the five earrings is encased in a cute black box so I didn't have to worry about buying extra cases. I especially love the garnet pair because of its rich red hue. It doesn't look dark and blackish like other garnet-mounted earrings are. It's also an ideal gift if you plan on buying jewels for someone special without spending a hefty sum. The great thing about is that I can wear it everyday for work, and choose between the darker shades to be worn at dinner parties and night outs. <end>  Absolutely beautiful!  I was happy to find these online for the holidays--I gave them as Christmas gifts and it filled out my list nicely! The earrings are just gorgeous! An exceptional value!! <end>  Lovely collection  These earrings are beautiful. They are a bit paler than pictured, but the scrollwork on the sides is elegant and expensive looking. We have 3 daughters, and all of their birthstones were accounted for in this assortment. It will make an excellent Christmas present--great bang for your buck. Each pair comes individually boxed and the stones are clear and sparkly!! <end>  Nice - wish they were a little bigger though!  The studs are very nice. The backings are a little small and hard to manipulate if you have nails. Overall they are pretty little things. Delivery was flawless. I would recommend these studs. <end>  Not well made.  Right after receiving these, I decided to take a look at them.They are beautiful, and look very nice. Unfortunately, they are not very well made.The post broke off one of the Garnet earrings when I pulled the butterfly clasp off the post to remove the earring from the sponge. The post wiggled a little when I was pulling off the clasp, and when I tried to put the clasp back on, the post completely broke off.I tested the other earrings immediately. The posts didn't break off, but the butterfly clasps are hard to remove from the earrings, so if you're not really careful, I have a feeling that there will be more broken-off posts after some time. <end>  Great gift.  Girlfriend loved them. she switches them out for who has a birthday that month. looks very pretty in her ears. <end>  Fabulous Earrings  My husband ordered these for me and I love them. They are beautiful and I have received so many compliments on them. Well worth the money. <end>  very nice  The earrings are even prettier in person and they all come in an individual box. They are very good quality for the price and they are great to match with your outfits. Thanks a bunch! <end>  Best Deal and beautifull  These are really awesome 5 stud set that you can find, for that price - its a steal. Beautifully set. One of the best gifting idea. <end>  Robin, Waxahachie, TX  I am very pleased with these earings, they are much larger than I thought they were going to be and they are very pretty. I'm sure I could not have purchased 5 pairs of earings for the price I did anywhere else. <end>  A LOVELY GIFT  I bought this pretty set of earrings as a gift for a friend, and when they arrived very promptly and in a nice presentation case, I was well impressed. The recipient is very happy with these earrings, all of which she wears. This set is outstanding value for the money. <end>  Nice variety  Gave this set to our 11-year-old daughter for Christmas, since she'd recently had her ears pierced and was desperate for earrings. Nice quality for the price, and a great way to start her off. <end>  great quality and price  Great quality and price. I was impressed with the beauty and quality of the earrings. They came in a long jewelry box that contained 5 small square boxes which gives you the flexibility of giving them as 1 or 5 individual gifts. I highly recommend this product. <end>  Beautiful bargain  The color, cut and clarity of these stones is impressive. They really sparkle, much more than the picture. Any one of the sets would make a lovely gift, so it's nice that they come individually boxed.Not counting the post, they stand about 1/4" tall and just a little smaller than a pencil eraser in diameter, so they're very eye-catching.My ears are sensitive and I can't wear heavy earrings, but these are very comfortable. They don't droop at all on me, but it might help to switch out the tiny silver catches for the larger round discs. I plan to anyway, before they end up down my bathroom sink. <end>  Stones are huge!  The colors of the stones are beautiful, and the size of the stones are quite big. One of the best gifts I've purchased for so little money. Amazon to the rescue again! <end>  Earrings  These are nice, no doubt. Although, you get what you pay for. One of these "the blue topaz" ..well they are extremely light blue.......and the citrine....is a joke, because one is extremely ligther than the other. That is pathetic! <end>  Beautiful and comfortable  I have sensitive ears and these earrings are beautiful and they do not bother my ears even when left in for a few days! Love them! Very high quality!Charlene <end>  Consider the earring size  These earrings are very nice for the price, however they are much bigger than I expected. I gave these as a gift to my girlfriend, but with two piercings on her ear lobes, there isn't enough room for one pair of these and any other earring. For those with just one piercing, this makes a very nice gift. <end>  Nice variety  I got my ears pierced several months ago and I've been trying to find some nice earrings for my collection. I saw these, read the positive reviews and decided that, for the price, I would get them. They arrived within a few days in five separate boxes. The stones are very pretty and now I have something to go with any outfit. I have rather fat earlobes so I had no trouble with drooping. The setting is higher than most, but I think it's because the settings are nice also so why not show them. <end>  better than the pictures!  These earrings are So beautiful. They are larger than the pictures show, but not gawdy. I would describe them as very classy. I have not had any problem with the weight as some other reviewers, they do not droop on my earlobes. I purchased a set for my mother for her birthday, and she loves them so much I bought myself a set, to see what they really looked like. I plan on buying some more for gifts, they are that beautiful. The stones are very sparkley, set in ornate silver. If I did have a complaint, it would be that the boxes were not as pretty as I imagined. I thought they would be more elegant jewlery gift boxes but they are inexpensive looking. That is my only negative. The earrings themselves are fabulous and will make lovely gifts for all the women in my family. <end>  Something for every outfit  I have had double-pierced ears for years, but always only had one pair of little studs for the upper piercing. Now, finally, I have earrings I can match with my outfit (or my mood)!The delicate basket mounting is lovely! All the stones' colors are as described, EXCEPT for the blue topaz; the earrings I received were NOT sky blue, but more of a VERY pale, watery blue. Not ugly, but not as described. That's the only reason I couldn't give these 5 stars. <end>  Great gifts  These earrings make great gifts. Stones are a good size, nice and clear, various stones and shapes. The individual boxes make great gift for nieces, cousins, your daughters' girl friends. <end>  Love these earrings!  My husband bought them for me and I just love them. I just pop on the ones that match my outfit best and instantly feel more together. They're cut surprising nicely for the price. <end>  good value  Amazon shipped on time but received only four. Called and received a new set by a very courteous and efficient customer service. Stud earrings colors were brilliant and clear. Very satisfied with the product. <end>  great value, great gifts  Lovely earrings made five very nice gifts at a great price at less than $10 a pair. <end>  OK FOR REGULAR USE  opened the individually packed items in 5 small boxes. The color of the all the gemstones is pretty, however these studs donot have a delicate look.The stones and the structure should have been alittle smaller. The ones are the topaz , amethyst and garnet for their size. They slightly protrude over the surface because of their base silver design. They look good for women with wide earlobes. A good deal of 35$ for 5 pairs and can be used as a daily wear. <end>  Look as beautiful as in the pictures  This is the first time I ordered jewelry online, and I was prepared to be disappointed, considering you are getting 5 pairs of earings for about $40. Although the earrings looked beautiful in the pictures, I was thinking, well, they may look horrible in real (as many things you buy from online are). But I was totally surprised by how nice and beautiful these earrings are when I received them today. They look exactly like in the picture, and the gems are not small at all ( I was also expecting them to be tiny tiny gems). I especially like the peridot and the amethyst ones. Very nice color and shape. The garnet ones are not as red as I would have liked, but again, considering the price, they are worthy enough. <end>  Please heed negative reviews regarding drooping on the ear!  I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund. <end>  Great Value  Even the previous reviews don't do justice to these earrings. I believe this is truly the best "deal" I've ever gotten. The earrings are absolutely beautiful - well cut, well set. The colors are vibrant, and identical to the photo. One reviewer thought the garnet too dark, but it's really a beautiful garnet - deep red without being "black" like so many cheaper garnets. When you consider that you're paying less than $10/pair the quality is astounding. [...] Delivery was typical of any other Amazon purchase. <end>  Beautiful!  These earrings are just as beautiful as they look in the picture - in fact, better than they look in the picture. The stones are nicely colored, and are very clear and sparkly. I don't have a problem with the earrings drooping in my ears.They came packed in good-looking satiny blue individual gift boxes inside a matching larger box. Each small box has a square of anti-tarnish paper in it, which is a nice touch. I am delighted with them - they look like expensive jewelry, but are quite reasonably priced. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase!For people who are afraid these earring will fall forward - it is possible to buy very inexpensive acrylic disc earring stabilizer guards. The stabilizer discs keep heavy earrings flat to the ear. Earring stabilizer discs are available at craft stores.People with small fragile earlobes might also want to take a look at the 3mm gemstone earring set instead 10k Gold 3mm Garnet, Amethyst, Blue Topaz, Peridot and Citrine Stud Earring Set <end>  Beautiful Gems, but slippery backings  These earrings were supposed to be gifts for family, but I sent them back as the backings were not very tight and since the gemstones are set so high and in such substantial settings, they would become loose in my earlobe and always looked odd, like they could fall out at any moment. Beautiful stones, lovely fancy silver work, but they stick out of the lobe too much for me and the backs can't really support the weight. <end>  Better than I hoped for  These were way better than I thought they would be. I really love every pair. In another review the person commented on the color of the garnet not being red enough but they really are as pictured. I was also worried that the earrings would be too heavy, but I forgot I even had them on until someone complemented me. Highly recommended. <end>  Nice but very large stones  The earrings are beautiful but way too large for my small earlobes. The earrings do sag, but this is easily solved by using the disk-like earring backs that come with other earrings. The posts bend easily and the earrings protrude quite far from the ear due to the setting. One thing I disliked was that when the head is turned slightly, all you can see is the side of the setting - the stone is best viewed directly from the front. The stones are very beautiful and having the different shaped cuts for each type was nice. The fancy silver setting is also nice. They are a great value for the quality product received. However, I have returned the earrings and will look for something a bit smaller. <end>  FABULOUS  This is such a nice set - I wear a different pair everyday. My only disappoint in them is the size - I was hoping to wear them in the top of my double pierced ears - but I can't because they are TOO BIG. I have gotten so many compliments on them. Yes, you can break them up and give them out as gifts. They would make GREAT gifts. But you will need to order 2 sets, because you will want to keep a set for yourself.I tell everyone where I got them from! <end>  Too heavy on the ear  I agree that these are a great bargain, and the stones are all beautiful. The only problem is that they flop over on the earlobe because they are so heavy. They also are set very high, so from the side you mainly see the silver setting. I bought these for my sister, and she didn't end up keeping them because they sagged downward on her ear lobe. I tried them on and they worked ok for me. I guess one just needs to have thick and short earlobes to make these heavy earrings sit properly on the ear. <end>  Droopy earrings  I agree with the reviews that these are very nice stones. However, I should have paid heed to the review that discusses the three "dimensionalness" of these earrings. They do not sit well on the ear and you see the setting while the stone droops toward the ground. Wish now I hadn't bought them. <end>  Great for casual dress  Sudden urge for nice not too loud earrings. These colors compliment all my clothes. Even great for youngsters 14-18 as they are sterling. Good value too! <end>  earring set  they are really nice earrings. you would expect earrings like that to be more,but they are not and they are very nice,thank you <end>  very good...  they enchant my hoops to me are pretty small and elegant, as it is seen in the photo. very good. I recommend them... <end>  Great value for the price  Last Christmas I bought this set for my mother, and I was so pleased with how they looked I decided to buy a set for myself. They are definitely big enough to be seen but not overbearing, and the colors are beautiful. I rated this set 4 stars because the garnet is not quite the best color; it looks more brown than red, but the picture is pretty accurate so it wasn't a surprise. <end>  excellent  speedy delivery. so much better than expected. beautiful colors .will do business with you again <end>  Earring Review  I am very happy with the earrings. (As well as the service - in that I received them in no time at all.) <end>  What a variety of colors  You can't you wrong if you purchase these earrings, they are just wonderful. All the pairs have their own unique shape and are set in a very detailed prong setting. The stones give a brilliant sparkle. They are bigger than I expected and sit high on your ear. Perfect size to let everyone see their beauty.I have to admit that the light blue topaz ones are my favorite of all. They resemble a cut piece of ice with a hint of blue - just beautiful.Another plus is how the earrings are individually boxed. You can actually give them out as five separate gifts. If you do happen to purchase this earrings as a gift, I highly recommend that you get a set for yourself. <end>  Great buy!!!!!  The settings are superb. The stones, although small, are perfect and I've received many compliments on them. I love them. One of the best Amazon buys!!!!!!! <end>  A lot of sparkle, not a lot of money.  This looked good online. It looks better in person. My wife was very pleased with the design and quality, and I was very pleased with the purchase experience. <end>  Amazing Deal!  This earring set is an amazing deal. They are absolutely beautiful! They are large enough to see the amazing colors and the silver is sparkling and bright. You will not be at all sorry about this purchase. My favorite is the citrine...it is stunning. <end>  Absolutely beautiful!!!!!  When my amazon package arrived, I was excited. When I opened it up, I was delighted. Each pair of earrings was individually boxed. Yeah, as if I would share these beauties with anyone, I mean seriously. They are exquisite, sizable stones and look lovely on. I bought these as a gold box deal, but I would have happily paid more than the every day price. You cannot go wrong with these. If you're the generous type, they make a terrific gift  o) <end>  Loveed these earrings  I ordered these when they were offered for $35 in lightening deals. Worth the money I paid. The earrings look beautiful. Even My husband liked them and complimented me when I was wearing one of those. <end>  Beautiful Stones - Worth the price!  There are 5 individual dark blue boxes within a horizontal card type slip case. They do NOT have velvet bags -- they are on fuzzy dark blue foam pads with foam pads above them. They look really nice but the blue topaz ones are kind of light against the dk pads but look good on but I am wondering if they are not exactly the same color - very slight. The garnets are perfectly garnet color which is an orange red - the red predominates. (Garnets are not red like rubies.) None of them drooped on my ear and I don't have much of a lower ear -- my ears are attached to my head all the way down with no lobes at all but the earrings look good. The gems are all shiny (faceted and polished like regular gem stones) and do have very small backings but the posts and the rest of the setting is substantial. They don't seem to set too high and it is nice that they are all different shapes.I think they are worth the money I got them for $34.99 at Amazon = $6.99 a pair. Regular price is $55.00 = $11.00 a pair which is STILL a good deal for sterling silver earrings with genuine faceted gemstones. A great gift, too! <end>  Gorgeous and sparkly!  I ordered these when they were 35 on Gold Box and I am so happy I did! They are all beautiful and I am amazed at how they sparkle! The Blue Topaz is very light, when compared to the black box I thought maybe it was a Cubic Zirconia, but once removed from the black I could see that it was blue. And even though it's a pale blue the sparkle in it is amazing, so it's one of my favorites! I think the Citrine is my least favorite, I think because of the rectangular shape it seems larger than the others and less dainty/feminine. I had the intention to give away some of these and keep only a couple.. but I am definitely keeping the Peridot, Amethyst and Blue Topaz ones for myself! I may give the Garnet to my mother, mainly because I don't wear reds, and I expect she will think that it cost MUCH more than it actually did! These are BEAUTIFUL earrings! Also, I have no problems with them drooping in my ears at all! <end>  2 YEARS AND THEY STILL LOOK BRAND NEW!  I've had this set for over 2 years now and I still love them and still wear them all the time! <end>  very nice sterling earrings  these earrings were a great deal. and just what I needed. we aren't allowed to wear large or dangling earrings at work anymore and that is all that I own. so these were exactly what I needed. the price was right too. <end>  As good as they look  I was a little worried ordering these based on reviews I had read. But I love them. They're a perfect size, the colors are exactly what I was looking for, and they don't fall forward on my ear. I'm guessing that those who experienced this problem either had not put the back on tight enough, or had their ear holes too low in the lobe. They are mounted a little higher than most gemstone earrings, but I find this just lets more light through so the color shows up better. <end>  Great value  The gemstones are a nice quality and cut, very clear and well colored in solid silver settings. They are packaged to be able to break them up into 5 separate gifts or give together. This is a very attractive, high quality earring wardrobe for the money. <end>  Probably not good for short haired folks.  Read reviews carefully! They do stand up quite a bit. They don't pull my ear lobe down, but I do wish the setting wasn't so high. Good size stones for the price you are paying. <end>  Very Nice!  Very nice earrings. My wife was impressed with the quality & size. <end>  Almost unwearable  I saw these and immediately saw what a great deal they were for the price for authentic gemstones. However, when my wife wore them we both realized that the combination of the large stones with the high setting pushes the earring so far from the ear that it droops. At this point we're considering making them into so other piece of jewelry since they're not really useful as earrings. Too bad since they were such a great idea. <end>  Gem Of A Deal!  How lovely! I am so pleased with the quality, clarity and size of these Sterling Silver earrings. It is difficult to select a favorite because they are all beautiful. The colors are both clear and brilliant. I had no trouble wearing them and look forward to wearing them with many different clothing choices. I keep them in myVitaminder Pill Case Stackerso I can easily see which one I want to wear. These 5 sets of earrings are one 'Gem Of A Deal'! ~ Mrs. B. <end>  Great gift at a great price  Great Christmas gift at a great value. From the reaction I guess I did good. Highly recommended... A+ <end>  Gem Earrings  Excellent quality earrings. Very nicely detailed and gems are bright and precisely cut. <end>  Such A Deal!  This is a great little set of earrings! The stones look nice and the silver is sparkly. I got them a few days ago and I'm having a fun time mixing and matching them with my outfits. This is an awesome deal and you definitely get your money's worth.Note  One of the reviewers said they were too big and weighed down her ears. I have pretty small ears and earlobes and I haven't found them to be too big or heavy at all. <end>  Good quality, great price  I bought this 5-pack of earrings for my girlfriend when it was on sale for about 75% off. I'm no expert, but the studs seemed to be of high quality and the gemstones were bigger than I thought they would be. My only regret is that I gave her all five sets at once, instead of gifting them one at a time! Anyway, she loves them. I would definitely recommend these studs. <end>  Perfect  I needed earrings I could wear everyday. These are perfect! They look really nice so you can lounge at home or wear them out. Some reviews said they were too heavy and pulled down when worn. So glad I didn't listen. They are a little heavy but any other way would cost in quality of the product. If they pull down when you wear them just tighten the back by push the backs closer to the ear. Love my new earrings! <end>  stud earring set  The earrings displayed in the add were the exact size and colors. They fit my earlobes fine. They are kind of chunky, but you want people to see them don't you? They are well made and worth the price. If thinking of purchasing them for a gift, be aware the boxes are very plain. Each pair is set into styrofoam padding in their own individual box. <end>  Glad I purchased... Very nice!  These were awesome earrings. Very beautiful and inexpensive. Totally surpassed expectations for the price. My wife loves them. If they become available again, order them and match them up with the pendants. These items were perfectly matched and made for an awesome gift. I wish I'd ordered several of the earrings and the pendants to give as gifts. <end>  Small, fragile, indifferently colored  I guess I was expecting too much after reading all the great reviews. However, I was SOO disappointed after opening the boxes. The stones are small and get lost on my ears--and I don't have particularly big ears. The settings are thin and bendy. Here are my comments regarding each set Garnet  Too dark. When they're on my ear, you can hardly notice that they're red. They look almost black.Amethyst  Too light. They're almost pinkish, and don't look like amethysts at all.Blue topaz  Too light. The color is washed out and almost unnoticeable.Citrine  Again, washed-out. The color is more yellowish than orange.Peridot  This is the only set with which I'm even the slightest bit happy with. Nice lime-green color.All in all, I wish I'd spent my money on something else. <end>  Pleased with Purchase  I bought these earrings for a pre-teen. The price was perfect. The earrings themselves are lovely. The stones are large enough for an adult to wear, but also perfect size/weight for a young lady. Not too big or showy for a younger person. With the price, this is a no-brainer and a nice addition to a jewelry collection. <end>  Great for the price!  For the price they are great. They go with everything. They are a little long, but they work fine for me. They aren't too big as some reviewers mentioned. I like them and would tell my friends about them. <end>  Shiny  I bought these for my girlfriend years ago and still look brand new they came in their own boxes and very clean never any issues excels she lost one for 6 months. Good gift for early relationship gift giving. <end>  Excellent value  These earrings are a great basic set, and perfect to give as a gift. They were a good quality and size, especially for the price. The only comment would be that the garnet was very dark, almost more black than red. <end>  nice studs  the colors of the earings are nice and you may wear them all day morning or night. though i have not wear them yet but they look very good. <end>  Nice!  These are just the ticket if you need attractive small earrings for daily wear. I was pleased with the look, quality, and value and variety of colors and different shapes. They fit comfortably and also fit the bill for an attractive small stud earring. LH <end>  Great colors for small ears  My granddaughter loves these earrings. She's only eleven and has very tiny ears, so the size of these earrings was perfect. The colors were bright and very pretty. <end>  This was a great deal and made for great gifts  I usually am not a big jewelry purchase person but this caught my eye. I do wear earrings daily and so do friends and family. This made great mother's day gifts for my mother, my daughter in law and myself! The pair I gave my daughter in law was my granddaughter's birthstone so that was a nice touch and the one I selected for my own mom matched her usual jewelry choices.I was very happy with the size and quality of the stones and the settings. <end>  Beautiful.  I received this as a gift for my anniversary and it was the most beautiful item that I received. I love how they go with most everything I own. They are comfortable for long wear or to wear overnight as well. The colors of the stones are very clear and vibrant, the detail in the silver that holds the stones is gorgeous, and the double prongs that hold the stones are imaculate. They are truly all around beautiful. <end>  Highly recommended  It is very well crafted and looks awesome. I gave this as a gift to my wife and she's loving it. <end>  Even better than I expected  Was very please with product. Stone sizes are larger than I expected and I think a great deal for the price. I had no problem with the setting being too large for my ear lobes. Overall I was very please with the color, shapes, looks, size, and especially the price of this set. Would recommend to friends ( I already have). <end>  Great set of earrings to own!  I ordered these earrings around Christmas b/c they seemed like such a great deal... and they were! They are awesome. I kept all of them for myself but they would have been perfect to give as gifts too b/c they all came in separate boxes. Very cool! Love em! <end>  Amazing Quality for Price!  These earrings are my new favorites! The stones are beautifully matched in generous size, color and shape. The well-polished, silver basket settings accent each stone beautifully, and the posts are straight and sturdy. I do make a point to push the backing up snug to support the weight of the stones. My ear lobes are not particularly thin, so I don't find drooping to be problematic. If this were a problem, then I'm sure earring backs with supportive, plastic disks would work well. <end>  Earrings are beautiful!  Pierced gemstone stud earrings are beautiful. The colored stones are large, and the silver settings are beautiful. They are exactly as described, and were a wonderful Christmas gift for my mother-in-law! Excellent quality! <end>  Earring Set  The item was very satisfactory. It will help to know the exact size of the stones before ordering.Thanks <end>  Nice set  Bought a pkg and gave pairs to daughthers and wife as a gift. Real hit. Nicely priced. <end>  how about the feeling ?  this earring set looks pretty , but I'm not sure how about the feeling when take on it ? <end>  Great value, quality  I actually bought these two years ago, then again for my mother this past Christmas. We both love the sets. They're great for someone looking to start or expand their collection. The colors of the stones were very nice and equally matched. Nice size, not too small, not too big. <end>  nice collection of small earrings  The different colors are nice to have and each earring has a different shape which I liked. I am very allergic to nickel and possibly some other metals. I have a slight reaction to these earrings so I have to take these off after a day or so. However, I only have had one pair of earrings where I could leave them on indefinately so I wouldn't take this as too negative a comment on the earrings. <end>  beautiful stones  Got two sets, one for each daughter. The earrings are beautiful just wished that they said genuine or sterling ... somewhere! Boxes made it look like they we just cz's <end>

 B000300YSA  Ocean Sailboat Nickel Free Sterling Silver Boat Ship Hook Earrings ||	  Very nice!  I purchased these earrings as a gift for a friend and was extremely pleased with the quality. Better yet, my friend was delighted with them. This is the only product I've purchased from Silver Insanity, but I wouldn't hesitate to order again. Very pleased. <end>  Small but good!  The earrings are very cute, I just find them a little on the small side. Otherwise, totally satisfied! <end>
 B000300YTO  Mens Sterling Silver Gothic Wrapping SNAKE Ring size 11.5(Size 9) ||	  Good looking, but horribly fragile  I ordered this ring about three and a half months ago, and after wearing it nearly everyday, it recently broke literally in half (so now I have to "C" shaped pieces). I was taking it off, it fell on a hard surface from about two feet and cracked on the weld located directly opposite the snake "head" part. I was never excessively rough with the ring, so it had to be craftsmanship. Also noticed was that the silver plating had begun to come off rather quickly around the edges of the ring, and it turned black. The plating wearing off wasn't too bad looking but I was rather dissapionted when it broke in half in a situation were most rings would leave unscathed. I am giving it a two because it looks good and feels heavy, but is simply made to a standard not fit for everyday use. I would only recommend it to people looking to use it casually, once or twice a week. Otherwise, it will break, it is not a ring to wear everyday. <end>
 B000300YVC  Heavy Sterling Silver Wire & Chain Mens Ring Size 12(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Great ring...  I like this ring very much, it is actually the first ring I have ever purchased for myself, and fits my appearance well(Im, kind of a rocker guy). The only negative things about the ring is that it can damage some things due to the deep ridges. Also, do not wear the ring if you are using a bar of soap, because it will literally dig chunks out of the soap, and get stuck in the ring. It is easy to wash out, but reaps hell on your soap supply, haha. However, I feel that this was a great purchase, and I actually feel "naked" when I take the ring off. It almost feels like it's meant to be on my hand at this point. Which I've only worn for a little over a month. Also, if your fingers are very close together, I would not reccomend this ring, I have boney more spaced out fingers. However, if you do not have a boney more thin spaced out fingered hand. You are most likely going to have sores on your surrounding fingers from the width of the ring, unless you put the ring on your thumb. I even had a sore in the webbing of my fingers. However, I like the ring so much I left it on and the sore went away....P.S. The ring also seems to protect my hand. If I make a fist or touch something with the outside of the hand. The ring always seems to make first contact. <end>  Loving Ring  I bought this product as a second ring to wear when I was dressed casually. After I recieved the ring it has become my number one choice to wear. It is comfortable and actually has a classy look to it.I wear this ring all the time and get many compliments on it. When I ordered this ring I never thought I would love it as much as I do. This ring was a great find. <end>  Nice Ring  I love this ring. I purchased it from Amazon about a year ago and I wear it everyday. I get many compliments about the ring. I would recommend this ring to anywho who is into silver. <end>  christmas  the ring is sturdy, and heavy, worth the price, came quickly, my husband loved it. he wears it all the time., <end>

 B000300Z1Q  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Genuine Amethyst Hook Earrings ||	  used for my wedding  I gave these to my bridesmaids to use on the day of our wedding. They were nice-didn't look too cheap either. <end>  Lighter than expected  Shipping was very prompt and I received the earrings within 3 days. The silver celtic knot design was exactly as shown. But I was disappointed that the stones in my earrings wasn't the same vibrant lavender shade in the picture. Unless you're really close to the earrings you almost can't tell they're purple. To get an idea of how light the amethyst are google rose de france amethyst (3rd pic). I wish someone had warned me in advance before buying. <end>

 B000302AP0  Sterling Silver Chai (Medal) Pendant 3/4" (18mm) ||	  not as I expected  Warning!!! The picture and the actual product is totally different. The pendant in the picture shows depth and quality of the silver, but when I ordered it, it was nothing but a very thin faux replica and the extremely flimsy piece that connects the pendant to the necklace can break allowing you to loose the pendant. I am dissappointingly returning my necklace. <end>  Judaismo Joyerias  Este tipo de cadenilla que trae con sigo una medalla con las letras Yod y Chet decima y octava letras en el alfabeto hebreo se pronuncia Jai o Chai cuyo significado seria Vivo o con Vida es sencillamente algo simple y elegante no muy comun como lo es la cruz o la estrella de david pero muy atrallente y a decir verdad en cuanto a ella solo eh resivido elogios hasta el dia de hoy. <end>
 B00030DBR6  Solid Sterling Silver 8mm Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Good product  The items from this site are beautiful and fairly priced. Shipping is quite fast. Thank you! <end>  Buyer Beware  I bought this ring to use as a junker substitute wedding band when out in the woods/backpacking/etc. To be quite honest, the price is right here for a nearly disposable ring. It really is dirt cheap. But, you get what you pay for. As I wore the ring today to get a feel for it, I noticed the seam where it was sized as the solder showed up as a distinct dark strip with a large pool at one end of the seam. It is insignificant due the role this ring plays for me, but you should be forewarned that the quality, at least in my case, is directly proportional to the price. If you're looking for something nice that you will wear on a regular basis, you may want to spend a little more money, but if you want a beater to take damage you would rather not inflict on the wedding band you invested in, this is perfect.&lt;edit> Well, to seal the deal, it turned my finger blue over night due to the sloppy solder job. <end>
 B00030FDHW  Large Sterling Silver Oval Genuine Green Jade Post Stud Earrings ||	  pretty good earrings  The earrings are about the size of an eraser on top of a pencil. The color was slightly lighter than pictured but they did match. Overall, the quality looks pretty good. Considering the price, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. <end>  Jade Earrings - Delightful!  The jade earrings were exactly as pictured. My ears are sensitive to some metals, and these cause absolutely no adverse reaction at all. I'm very satisfied with the quality and design, and glad that these are the ones I chose from the wide variety that I browsed. <end>  Looks great, just a little bigger than what I thought -- but I still love 'em.  Amazon is my go to place! I don't have to fight the crowds and I just let my fingers do the walking. The return policy is wonderful too! Easy sneezy! <end>
 B00030FDJ0  Garnet and MOONSTONE SLIDE Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Very pretty  It's only fault is as you can see in photo, it requires a small chain. Note even the clasp has to be small to get through the opening. Otherwise it is very nice. <end>
 B00032RHBA  DiamonUltra&trade; Cubic Zirconia Silver Cutout Crown Ring ||	  Not Silver??  I don't think that this ring is truly sterling silver. Maybe its just plated. After wearing mine for a little over month, it began to tarnish. I thought that was normal and that it just needed cleaning until a week later when the silver had rubbed off and exposed a white colored metal. I was so disappointed because I really like the look of this ring and I got lots of compliments on it. Mind you, this only happened with the actual band of the ring. The crown hasn't turned color at all. I'm in the market for another crown ring but I'm still wearing this one in the meantime. <end>

 B00039NI6Q  The Rosary with the Pope John Paul II ||	  Great Collectible and Sign of Honor  This CD allows you to pray along with the voice of the late great John Paul II in Latin with music. 2 CD set is very comprehensive and lots of printed information comes with it. <end>  2 CD Set  Released in 1994.Contains The Joyful MysteriesThe Sorrowful MysteriesThe Glorious Mysteries <end>  Love it!  I love this set. Prayers in Latin. The late Holy Father's voice is so lovely. It will move you to pray more often. Help keep you in prayer while puttering around the house. <end>  I should have read the fine print.  I was disappointed to learn that this rosary of Pope John Paul II is in latin. I was looking for English. <end>
 B0003TOQIK  Paisley Heart Pin from the Artazia Collection #051 HP ||	  Great pin,but needs final finishing  I loved the pin and delivery was amazing-3 days from order date. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because, although it basically solid and well-made, the edges were not finished as nicely as they should have been. Most people may not have noticed, and won't be noticed when worn, but as an art teacher, I have done some jewelry making and am aware of details. <end>
 B000406CNA  Flowers in a Pot Pin from the Artazia Collection #282 GP ||	  Beautiful  I've bought three pieces from this collection and every one of them has more than thrilled me. (unfortunately I haven't yet bought one FOR me...). For a pin, this is rather expensive, but it really is a work of art. I recommend this line for anyone who likes jewelry that is different and still classy. <end>
 B0004K48GS  Trapeze Earrings Hypoallergenic stainless steel ear wire from the Artazia Collection #218 GE ||	  Adorable earrings  I got these for my goddaughter who actually is a trapeze artist. She loves them. <end>  Beautiful Trapeze girl earrings  The earrings were beautiful, and came quickly. They were the perfect gift for an aerialist performer, and she loved them.The subject of the artwork was the first selling point, but seeing them in person, they were truly exceptional! <end>
 B0004K4D40  Dog Earrings from the Artazia Collection #334 NE ||	  Adorable!  These earrings are so charming, so different from anything else out there, and will easily appeal to anyone who loves both dogs and bright colors.

Don't hesitate to buy these if you are a dog lover. Great merchant and fast shipping also! <end>
 B0004K59M0  Star & Chai (Life) Necklace from the Artazia Collection #326 JN ||	  wonderful necklace  this is the most beautiful necklace. I actually ordered it from the US Holocaust Museum. i just lost it i am unfortunately so sad now but it was the most beautiful necklace that i ever owned...there were a few bad things about it that i noticed. the little gems fell off. and the chain was a bit short but it was gorgeous. <end>
 B0004K5AI8  Choshen Judaic Necklace from the Artazia Collection #327 JN ONK ||	  A Judaic, artistic masterpiece...  There's nothing like being a Jewish Male & having the unique opportunity to wear, with pride, the Breastplate or Choshen. The detail in the pieces of glass melted to increase the power of the palette, makes this an ornate piece of Fine Jewelry.Add the beads, springs & other gems intricately placed in and on the plate itself & the designer created something so stunning, eye catching it makes one extremely proud, lucky to wear it....A plethora of detail that expresses a religious amulet, starred at by others as the colours, striking as they may be, work well together & knowing no two are a like, makes it an even masterful piece of work that speaks volumes of Jewish History.Can be worn with a suit or jeans & a 'T', whatever one prefers as the pallette of colours will most definitely compliment as a treasure for the wearer & the on looker in envy...truly amazing. <end>  Beautiful necklace!  I bought this for my niece as a Bat Mitzvah gift. I wanted to give her something she could keep to remember her special day, and was very happy to find this unique necklace. She was very happy with the gift. Would definitely purchase another piece of jewelry from this line. <end>
 B0004K5D4O  Judaic Chai (Life) & Heart Necklace from the Artazia Collection #402 JN HN ||	  Lovely Heart  A piece defiantly worth having!

 B0004K5FKG  Colorful Star of David Necklace from the Artazia Collection #2301 JN ||	  Unique and fun piece  Purchased this necklace as a Hanukkah gift for my teenage daughter (18). She loved it! It's well made and just the right size to enjoy, not too big or small. All my nieces loved it too (ages 13-27). I will purchase jewelry from this collection again. <end>  I love it!!  I bought several months ago and wear it once a week at least. It's a little pricy compared to its quality (especially chain looks cheap), but still worth to buy it. The design is so unique! <end>  Star of David Necklaces  These Artazia pieces are pretty, but if you're looking for Star of David necklaces that embody more of the mystical power and sacred symbolism of the Star of David you might prefer to check out David Weitzman's work (more info in my profile.) I find the Artazia pieces a little to "out there" and interpretive, not quite as magical and lovely as they should be. <end>

 B00061FC24  16cttw Sterling Silver Red Genuine Garnet Tennis Bracelet 7.5" ||	  Picture Doesn't Do it Justice  I have a 6 inch wrist and 8 inch ankle, so it is nearly impossible to find bracelets and ankle bracelets that fit. The cost of paying a jeweler to shorten tennis bracelets is usually higher than the cost of the bracelet. (Apparently, they need to remove the stones before they can heat the metal hot enough to remove links.) I have a garnet tennis bracelet set in 14kt gold that cost almost $1000 to buy and shorten. I was leery at the relatively inexpensive cost of this one, but I always wanted a silver tennis bracelet for my garnet collection.When I got it, I was shocked to see how similar it looked to my gold one. The stones are the rich, deep, maroon-red color of expensive garnets, not the cheaper brownish kind like this photo suggests. Also, the stones are oval like I was hoping. (At the time I posted this, there were photos showing two different bracelets  one with oval stones, one with pear shaped stones.)My jeweler priced the silver work much less than I expected, so I bought a second bracelet and I had 1 inch of links taken out of the first and added to the second to make a matching bracelet/anklet pair. It turned out great without a color change where the work was done, so the silver is probably natural without any plating.Don't assume the bracelet will be too big for you just because it was for me. I'm small. This ad says the bracelet is 7.5 inches, which is true when it lies flat. But when it is curved and clasped, the inside circle created is almost exactly 7 inches long, which is standard for most women.In short, this bracelet is beautiful and looks much more expensive than it is. I'd definitely recommend it! <end>  Great Buy  I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas. It looks much better in real life compared to the picture. However, it was a little bigger than I expected, but she loved it and wears it almost every day. <end>  Wow !  Just got this beautiful bracelet ! The pictures do not do it justice. This is a very attractive bracelet and the wife just loves her present. We both said "Wow!".Thanks for the nice item and fast, free delivery silver-insanity.com. <end>

 B00063DMK6  Large Silver-Tone Pewter Celtic Norse Jeweled Moon Pendant Necklace ||	  simply stunning  I came across this when I was surfing around amazon and it really caught my eye. It's a gorgeous pendant of Celtic-Viking influence. The design and quality of this pendant is worthy every penny and then some. The image on amazon just does not do it justice. Great with turtleneck sweater.I especially loved the large bale to where you can easily switch to a longer chain. <end>  Beautiful  I love this Pendent, came from my beloved husband as a gift but Wearing it on a daily bases, turn my chest black? <end>  Moon Pendant Necklace Review  I like it.

 B00063K1PK  St. Michael Medal 14K Yellow Gold 20X14mm with 18 inch necklace ||	  This St. Michael Medal is for female's  I received the St. Michael Medal today. It is beautiful. It is petite and lightweight. This medal is definitely meant for female's only. It is not a medal that a brave young male police officer would want to wear. If you are ordering for a female police officer you won't be disappointed. <end>
 B00063K2O0  St. Michael Round Medal 14K Yellow Gold 12.0mm with 18 inch necklace ||	  Tiny, couldn't use, Sent back and NO reimbursement yet!  The medal is so tiny that you can't read it. Poor quality. I couldn't use it. I returned it to the seller and have yet to be reimbursed for the item. The process has been a nightmare for me. I have been working with Amazon for resolution but there's lots that has gone on since mid December. I won't go into it yet but it needs to be resolved fast. It should not be this difficult. I may have to file suit. <end>

This was a christmas gift for my boyfriend and it was so dissapointing. it looked nothing like the picture -- the band is really wide and not a flat brushed color like the photo -- it is super shiny and has rounded edges not flat as pictured. <end>  Plain and perfect!  My husband has a tendency to lose wedding bands. It has been 35 years and he has lost about 8 of them. Am I suspicious...no silly! He has skinny fingers and small knuckles and the rings just fall off when he is working. At first we bought spendy ones. Maybe $150 to $250. We always just liked plain bands...not fancy ones. But eventually I started looking for inexpensive ones so it wouldn't big a big deal when he lost it. Well....I bought this ring about a year ago and we both really loved it. It took 11 months for him to lose it. I just bought the 2nd one and we still love it. It is plain and comfortable. We think it looks just great for what we know is a disposable wedding band. If he loses this one we will be back for another just like it!! <end>  Good ring, nice price  The ring is everything that was promised at a decent price. The only thing, and this may be my fault, was that I was not aware that there was a coating on the ring to make it stay shiny. Normally, this would be a great thing, but I got it engraved, and part of the engraving is tarnished under the sealant. Still,the company was very helpful and timely, and I would order from them again. <end>
 B0006468QA  Cross With Holy Spirit 14K Yellow Gold 19X13mm with 18 inch necklace ||	  God's Blessings  I bought this Cross with the symbol of the Holy Spirit, as a gift for my niece. I'm very happy except I had hoped it would be bigger. My fault though as the company gave precise mesurements of the Cross. Either way I'm happy and I hope my neice agrees. <end>
 B000646BWG  Bracelet Silver Ball Rosary Sterling Silver 5.0mm with 18 inch necklace ||	  Breaks constantly  I have had nothing but problems with this bracelet. Everytime I wear it something breaks. Either the cross gets caught on something and falls off or the links pull apart so that the whole bracelet falls off. I've even had the center Ball on a wire peice fall of. How it came off of both sides at onece is beyond me. Whats more, it snags on all my clothing. Don't bye this unless you want to fix it every time you wear it. <end>
 B00064A6UY  Sterling Silver Natural Blue Sapphire Swirl Ring Size 6(Sizes 6,7,9) ||	  nice ring  It is a nice ring. the stones are a nice dark blue. <end>
 B00064A6WM  Sterling Silver Antique Style Filigree CZ Ring Size 8.5(Sizes 5.5,7.5,8.5) ||	  Lovely to Look At  This ring is certainly worth the price. It is a wonderful addition to my collection. A good buy. <end>
 B00064A78U  Sterling Silver Baby Blue Topaz Cluster Ring Size 5.5(Sizes 5.5,7,8,9) ||	  Simply Beautiful  I ordered this Baby Blue Topaz Cluster Ring because I am a loyal customer of sterling silver blue topaz rings. Upon recieving this ring I was totally excited and my anticipation of recieving the ring was exciting. This particular cluster is absolutely beautiful the sparkling color of the stones and the quality of the ring.Recieved numerous compliments and would recommend this ring if your looking for a ring that is set nicely with the blue topaz stones. I am completly satisfied and will order from this site again. <end>
 B00064BC3Y  Ruby Aurora Gem Star Wreath Reverse Belly Ring Tummy Huggy ||	  cheap  The items was very pretty while it lasted. However, it broke within a week of having it on. <end>  Good  The item looks more red then pink which is fine but expect so. Also It is small and just fits around the belly button, it seems heavy but isn't. I enjoy this item and am glad to get the item. <end>
 B00064BCRK  14 KT Yellow Gold Opal Huggies Earrings with 14k Regular Hoop Closure Findings ||	  great value  these earrings are even prettier "in person". They are so comfortable that I often forget I'm wearing them and leave them in for days! <end>  Way better than I expected!  I agree with all the previous rave reviews. I got these because they were pretty in the picture, and looked like they would truly hug my ears (tired of losing earrings when I comb my hair or go swimming). I was surprised by how sturdy, snug, and beautiful they are, and my husband said they are extremely "blingy." That means they sparkle from a distance, despite their small size. Some of that is the cut, some of that is that, even though they're small, they're thick, and the opal really gleams. Great value. <end>  Pretty earrings--poor workmanship  The closure came broken so I sent them back--no problems with the company accepting them. They were very gracious and apologetic but I didn't want to take a chance and order another pair. <end>  14K Opal YG Huggies  Disappointed that the earrings are so small but the opals are beautiful. Wish they were a bit bigger as I do have a hard time getting them in my ears. <end>  Beauty in a small package  I love pretty earrings. Le't face it. I love pretty things. I had looked at these earrings and passed them up for something "danglier," but these stayed in the back of my mind. So one day, I saw them on my Wish List, revisited them and bought. I thought of them as a casual purchase which I would wear occasionally. I surprised myself. I wear them quite frequently as they have turned out to be Beauty in a Small Package. They are great for casual days when I do not have to have something that matches just so so but want something flashy! They are nice and small (not too small to show up at all.)and I do not have to worry about dangles if I am cleaning or something. The Opals are of a very nice quality and are quite brilliant making Real beauty in a small package. I hate to keep harping on the fact that they are small, they are not really small. I am just used to wearing one and a half to two and a half inch dangles so for goodness sake take that into consideration when buying. They are probably what most people consider to be "just the right" size. One of the things I like the best about them is how easily they go on. I find myself wearing them quite often and consider them to be one of my best investments. If you decide to get them, I hope you like them as much as I do. <end>  Simply Gorgeous  These earrings are gorgeous! They sparkle, they are unique, and they match all of the rest of my opal jewelry! I highly recommend getting these earrings! <end>  Loved the earrings!  I ordered these earrings to give as a gift. They are beautiful, small but very shiny. I was tempted to keep them for myself! <end>  Beautiful and Good Value  These opal huggies are gorgeous--much prettier than in the picture. The picture doesn't show the sparkle and glow of these earrings. What a bargain, and everyone comments on them when I wear them. I am most pleased!! <end>  Feminine, beautiful  My mom bought me these for my birthday this year, and I love them. They are absolutely lovely and very feminine. Although they are "white" opal, don't be fooled by the mundane name. Mine have tons of fire, with flashes of blues, greens, and golds. The gold setting is actually faceted, so they catch all kinds of light to reflect. They are blingy without being gaudy. I'm totally in love. <end>  spectacular splendiporitude  My girlfriend bought these for her Moms birthday. She had recently had all her jewelery JACKED, which sucks, and she is a big fan of opal stuff. From what I saw, she was very happy with it. Not just the- "this is a gift from my daughter I have to act like I like em" happy. She really liked them. I am not a woman, and I don't wear jewelry, but these earrings were so nice (and fairly priced) I am now contemplating a journey into cross-dressing. Thankfully for anyone reading this, I don't own a camcorder, or I'd post a very disturbing video of me dancing with these earrings on. Overall, good item. If you are broke and need to pay rent or your gas bill, say screw it and buy these earrings. <end>  Order these earrings!  I bought these for myself and I love them. They are small but with lots of sparkle and they look very expensive. Easy to put on and take off.The cut of the gold gives them a great look. Very well made. <end>  More than expected  This item was ordered as a gift. Since I wear stud earrings, I wasn't even sure what huggy earrings were.   ) I just knew the recipient needed them small. These caught my eye and all I could think was "How lovely!"I let my fiance order the plain ones for his mother and I ordered these for her on November 19. Imagine my pleased surprise when I received them on November 23 - fast!The earrings ARE lovely - more than I expected from a picture. They are small, delicate-looking and just enchanting. I can't imagine her not being delighted with them. <end>  Small Earrings -- Big Impact!  I bought these earrings as a birthday gift for my Mom and she loved them! She likes hinged hoops and I was looking for something a little different for her. These hoops are small but really stand out! The opals have tons of fire and the sparkle of the diamond cutting enhances their beauty. The glowing reviews here helped me decide to purchase these earrings and I couldn't have been happier when I received them. The photograph doesn't do them justice. They are gorgeous! <end>  Love them  I bought my earrings about six months ago and I receive compliments all the time on them. I can wear them for long periods of time and have no trouble sleeping with them in. I wear them with an opal necklace that I purchased for $3,500 and I swear I get more compliments on the earrings than on the necklace.... well almost! They are indeed "blingy" for being so small. They sparkle from afar. Buy them. <end>  Huggies Earrings  I purchased these earrings as a Christmas gift for for my wife and she was absolutely delighted, praising especially their design and appearance. Considering the quality workmanship and the 14K gold content, this jewelry is a genuine bargain. <end>  Amazing! Classy!  I wanted to order these a while back but they were out of stock, I was so excited when I noticed that they were being offered again.These earrings are gorgeous. I am libra and always wanted to get birthstone earrings. I have perused opal earrings in the past...I don't love studs all that much...so hoops and dangles are pretty much what I go for.They are huggy's so they are neat, cute, and would have been understated except for the fact that these earrings are every bit as sparkly as the picture....more so!The diamond cut makes the light dance off both the gold ridges and the opal.The inlay of the opals in interesting and gives a different classy look.I love my jewellery to look like a cut above and this one is a winner.They also arrived before the estimated delivery date so thumbs up to gem avenue. Very satisfied so far.I give it a 5 plus rating. <end>  Unfair Return Policy Practices!  Earrings were cute, but due to the very small sizing they were very hard to open/close for the person I gifted them too. We needed to return them. Beware, it turns out free shipping is not really free with this Seller. Seller deducted S/H charges from my return even though my item was advertised with "free S/H", and I was not charged S/H on the product to begin with. Stated verbally in an email that they take back their S/H cost regardless, if you return a product for refund. It does not state this anywhere in the written policy they provided as it pertains to free shipping given to their customers. Yes, this would have been the written policy as stated if I had PAID S/H CHARGES in the transaction as read in your policy!! Read your own policy print please.Try learning a little something from best business practices from other companies who don't charge back what is supposed to be "FREE" to begin with. This is why those other companies get continued repeat customers and business. Or, better yet, try writing your policies clearly so that your customer is not mislead in anyway. Won't purchase again from this seller, what you did and how you did it, its just bad business! <end>  Very Small but Pretty  These earrings are very pretty. They shimmer in the light and the opals are fiery. I was disappointed that they are so small but my husband thinks they are beautiful. It's best to wear hair back over ears so that the earrings can be seen. <end>
 B00064C4YA  Sterling Silver BLACK ONYX Poison Box Ring size 6.5 ||	  beautiful but fragile  This ring is just beautiful, works very well, but the stone popped out the 2nd time I wore it and I had to superglue it back on. <end>
 B00064C50S  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Spin Worry Ring Sz 5.5(Size 6) ||	  High Quality - Excellent Amazon Vendor  Use as a guard ring w/Onyx Claddagh ring / Even super glue did not harm this -happened to glue 3 fingers together 2 yrs ago - Both Rings on same finger - Cleaned up w/Silver polish and still spins perfectly. Still an incident very much to local EMS amusement <end>  Great RIng!!!  This ring is very beautiful. It was a great deal and the ring spins very well as it should. The shipping was very fast. I am looking forward to purchase from this seller again. <end>  Lovely Ring  I bought this as a surprise for my daughter--so, I guessed at the size. Boy, was I way off! The shop took it back and sent another with no problems. My daughter loves it! <end>
 B00064C6EI  Sterling Silver Antique Style Filigree CZ Ring Size 5.5(Sizes 5.5,7.5,8.5) ||	  Lovely to Look At  This ring is certainly worth the price. It is a wonderful addition to my collection. A good buy. <end>
 B00064C6GG  Sterling Silver Wire & Chain Mens Ring size 8.5(Size 7,8,11,12) ||	  Great ring...  I like this ring very much, it is actually the first ring I have ever purchased for myself, and fits my appearance well(Im, kind of a rocker guy). The only negative things about the ring is that it can damage some things due to the deep ridges. Also, do not wear the ring if you are using a bar of soap, because it will literally dig chunks out of the soap, and get stuck in the ring. It is easy to wash out, but reaps hell on your soap supply, haha. However, I feel that this was a great purchase, and I actually feel "naked" when I take the ring off. It almost feels like it's meant to be on my hand at this point. Which I've only worn for a little over a month. Also, if your fingers are very close together, I would not reccomend this ring, I have boney more spaced out fingers. However, if you do not have a boney more thin spaced out fingered hand. You are most likely going to have sores on your surrounding fingers from the width of the ring, unless you put the ring on your thumb. I even had a sore in the webbing of my fingers. However, I like the ring so much I left it on and the sore went away....P.S. The ring also seems to protect my hand. If I make a fist or touch something with the outside of the hand. The ring always seems to make first contact. <end>  Loving Ring  I bought this product as a second ring to wear when I was dressed casually. After I recieved the ring it has become my number one choice to wear. It is comfortable and actually has a classy look to it.I wear this ring all the time and get many compliments on it. When I ordered this ring I never thought I would love it as much as I do. This ring was a great find. <end>  Nice Ring  I love this ring. I purchased it from Amazon about a year ago and I wear it everyday. I get many compliments about the ring. I would recommend this ring to anywho who is into silver. <end>  christmas  the ring is sturdy, and heavy, worth the price, came quickly, my husband loved it. he wears it all the time., <end>
 B00064C6I4  Sterling Silver CELTIC Knot Green Crystal Ring(Sizes 6,7,7.5,8,9) ||	  Love it  D  My daughter says "It is really pretty and I love it." It does not stain her finger. A good deal! <end>
 B00064C6IO  Sterling Silver Natural Blue Sapphire Ring Size 7.5 ||	  nice ring  It is a nice ring. the stones are a nice dark blue. <end>
 B00064IWVY  Oval Carnelian Ring (size  9) ||	  Item Didn't Match The Photo Or Description  Item arrived quickly and was nicely packaged. However, the Oval Carnelian Ring looked nothing like the photo on the Internet and I had to return it. Instead of being a nice, rich, blood red color with a high clear dome, it was a orange rust color with flat stone (very plain looking). I had to return it. <end>
 B00064IWZA  Turquoise Ring (size  11) ||	  If your looking for a men's silver and turquoise ring...  this may just be the ring for you. The ring pictured looked more green to me than what I wanted, but I was pleased to see the it was a nice blue color when it arrived. A tracking number was emailed so I knew exactly when it would be delivered. The ring is thick and smooth and fit is true to the size. I might like to see the price a little lower, but I still think it's well worth it. <end>
 B00064IWZK  Turquoise Ring (size  12) ||	  If your looking for a men's silver and turquoise ring...  this may just be the ring for you. The ring pictured looked more green to me than what I wanted, but I was pleased to see the it was a nice blue color when it arrived. A tracking number was emailed so I knew exactly when it would be delivered. The ring is thick and smooth and fit is true to the size. I might like to see the price a little lower, but I still think it's well worth it. <end>
 B00064URD0  Cool Dragon Print Pattern Symbol Pewter Ring ||	  So nice!  The ring is really awesome and the dragon pattern is clearly visible. It looks really nice, but it's just a little heavy. I really like the ring and I plan on wearing it a lot. <end>  Awesome!  I bought this ring for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it! It's a bit thicker than either of us thought it would be, but looking at the pictures of the ring now I can see I should've known. The dragon is large enough to be seen (I was a bit worried about that), and it's very clear. He wears it every day =) I would definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  Great Piece at a Great Price  Recently I discovered this company and am now buying their products like mad! The artisan quality of the work is impeccable, designs are clear and easy to see and they nicely add a discount coupon for the next order each time you order! My only complaint, and this has nothing to do with the jewelry, is that I forgot this was STERLING silver which on me tarnishes if I look at it wrong. I bought it in a 12 thinking I could use it as a thumb ring and even though my usual ring size (arthritis!!)is a 10, the 12 was too big for my thumb but did fit my middle finger. <end>
 B00064URKI  Dog Paws Print Pewter Ring ||	  Paw print ring  These are not sized correctly. I order two different sizes, both rings were the same circumferance and both too small to fit. <end>
 B00064URMG  Wood Spike Hammer Cross Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Junk  Had this for a week and the first time my daughter grabed it, it was broken. This metel is too weak for this product.

Great kids necklace though and good price. <end>  FISH DOLPHIN SHARK TAIL Silver PEWTER Pendant Necklace  GORGEOUS AND EXCELLENT! ! ! <end>
 B00064US3Y  Cool Bird Skull Bone Beak Spike Claw Pewter Ring, Size 9 ||	  A Decent Ring  When I received this ring, I was very excited and surprised, because it was bigger than I expected. The luster of it is a brushed look but the craftsmanship is mediocre at best. I found many imperfections, and because the metal is on the soft side, if you wack it on things, it tends to leave very small indents.Pros  Very cool design. Got many compliments on it, and It is comfortable.Cons  Soft metal, imperfect craftsmanship.Overall, Id say that I liked this ring and it is a very cool accessory, as long as it is cared for. I'd recommend it to a friend. <end>  pretty cool  its a cool ring its interesting, yet its not all "look at my i want attention" like those finger armors. people that did see it always thought it was some sort of space ship though. it was one of my favorite rings to wear.but now its broken because of the cheap material its made of. a medium sized math book fell on it and it pretty much pancaked. so as long as nothing gets on top of it, it wont break. but its definatly not worth buying again unless you're one of those rich people/kids <end>
 B00064US4S  Celtic Night Sleeping Moon Man Pewter Bracelet ||	  Celtic Night Sleeping Moon Bracelet  Bracelet is pretty enough but not very durable. Wore it daily for a month. I tend to find a piece of jewelry I like and just wear it for various lengths of time. This one broke beside the moon. I knew it was pewter and soft, but this is real soft. I make jewelry myself and the break was a thin spot in the braid connection to the moon. <end>  Great Company  I ordered this for me, when I was ordering a bracelet for my daughters best friend. I love it. It is very sturdy and I love the look. Once again, the company sent me another 20% coupon off for my next order. I had one to use with this order also. They are very prompt and get your order to you long before the dates required. It was properly packaged for safety. Great company to order from for all ages, who like the unusaul and new age look. <end>
 B00064USC0  Crystal Draco The Dragon Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Perfect  This necklace came on time and it was exactly what they said it would be. It looks exactly like the photo and it wasn't in any way broken or tampered with. It looks great and it made the perfect gift! The sellers gave me all the info I needed and I was glad there weren't any surprises when it came. It comes with the band shown in the picture so it's not just the pendant. I've been roped into thinking the pendant came with the chain before and it didn't so I was very happy this one gave exactly what it offered. <end>
 B00064USHA  Red Rhinestone Flaming Guitar Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Nice pendant  Bought this for my brother for Christmas. Had a really nice weight to it, and the designs were clean. Red stone looks a little chintzy, but it isn't bad. <end>
 B00064USJ8  Werewolf Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  So real, it barks!  This is not just a Goth classic, but is a beautiful rendering of a wolf head in mid-bark! I love mine. Details are amazing, right down to the teeth! Being pewter, it is fairly heavy, but still comfortable to wear. A must for wolf-lovers. Not sure why it is called a werewolf... <end>
 B00064USNY  Dolphin Dolphins Engraving Print Pewter Ring ||	  DOLPHIN LOVE GONE MAD  I love this ring!!!!!!! I didn't get a chance to send a comment earlier! This ring is of good quality!

It also makes a great present for anyone. I have large hands (size 11) and it was sized correctly! Has a great weight to it........If I could give more stars, I would....Thanks for a great experience  -) <end>
 B00064USRU  Blue Killer Whale Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Wasn't as blue as the picture  I would have rated the necklace higher but the one I received was not as blue in color as the picture. The necklace is quite nice and I do wear it. I do like the design. However, perhaps the color may have to do with the translation between computer screen color and actual metal color. <end>
 B00064USV6  Intricate Celtic Pattern Art Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Celtic Pewter Pendant  The pewter Celtic pendant looks better than its picture. I also liked the adjustable rope chain that came with it. It allows me to wear it long or short. <end>

Thanks again! <end>  Beautiful  I love this necklace. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. The rope necklace is great as I can't wear silver or gold (my skin tends to react to it) and it seems to catch everyones eye. <end>

He just loves it. I was concerned that I would have trouble finding a leather strap to fit with the pendant but one was included and I was very happy about that. <end>  Still no product  I still have not seen or heard anything about the product I ordered in December. <end>
 B00064UTAQ  German Eagle Talon Dagger Sword Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Great Necklace  I bought this necklace for my boyfriend. Definitely worth the money; it looks better in person than the provided pictures. The pendant size is perfect, fine detail... It's just a really cool guy necklace. <end>  cool  Purchased this because it matched a tattoo a friend has it hangs on my review mirror on my car looks so cool <end>  wunderbar  Nice size and detail. Huge loop on back for necklace is plenty large for some paracord. Masculine but with class. <end>  Good but not great  Got this for my girlfriend she says it's great in every way but one the loop on the back is huge so it doesn't lay flat it always lays one way or the other excellent quality just not quite perfect. <end>
 B00064UTIS  Flying Broomstick Witch Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  very cute  perfect exactly as I expected it to be  ) would buy from again <end>  looks bad  I should know from the price. too light, too small and looking like child jewelry.

 B00064UTT2  Southwestern Style Phoenix Pewter Cuff Bracelet ||	  Dont Do It!!!  Charged my account, and never sent the item. Took a bit to get my money back. A gift for my wife became a headache for her while i was deployed to the middle east... Sad. <end>  not bad but could be stonger  the design is nice but its rather small and too easy to bend as it constantly does when i move my wrist. <end>  perfect gift  This is to be a gift for my grandaughter, but I know she will be very thrilled to get it. Loves all Indian jewelry, but especially the bracelets! <end>
 B00064UU5U  Realistic Scimitar Sword Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Nice necklace  This necklace is very nice. it looks nice and it is kind of cheap. it is easily adjustable so I recommend it <end>
 B00064UU7I  Christian Cross In Jewish Star Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Very pretty and well priced  I am Catholic and my wife is Jewish. This was perfect for our daughter ) <end>  Different  I bought this for my man who grew up Jewish and is now Christian. So he got the best of both worlds. Very different. <end>  A Simple, Masculine Design  This item is exactly as portrayed in the photographs. It boasts a simple, masculine design with a brushed finish that is shiny but not too "glittery"-- again, a masculine design! It comes with a black cord that is long enough to fit anyone and that can be trimmed with scissors to whatever length you desire. It comes with a black velvet bag, too. I highly recommend it! <end>  just right to make the statement I want  I really like this necklace because you see the cross first, (I'm a Christian) and then the more subtle design of the Star of David (I celebrate my Jewish heritage). The silver is lovely and the adjustable leather strap is right for the design. <end>  Christian Cross in Jewish Star  Beautifully Crafted! I love the combination of The Cross and The Star of David, Also I love the necklace...I prefer materials other than chain. <end>  Really Nice Gift  I was in the market for a Jewish Star with a Cross in the middle as a gift. The reason I chose this one was due to the Amazon fulfillment (due to needing it promptly). The one I received did have a slight mark on it but nothing to go crazy about. For about 13 dollars, you really cannot complain. Plus, I like the fact that it is pewter, which is a cool material of tin and copper that ancient Egyptians use to wear. Just like a sentence that can be too wordy, there can also be necklaces that just have too much detail, which this one does not have. It has a simple design of a typical Jewish Star with a cut-out Cross in the middle. The other designs were too "wordy" so to speak, where there was so much detail you wonder what you're looking at. Although, if you do decide to get this gift-wrapped from Amazon, you should not. Amazon weirdly gift-wrapped it in a quasi- cardboard fold-out which was just bluntly "unappealing". Like other gifts I have had gift-wrapped from them, I presumed that they would just put a small piece of jewelery in a "small box", but sometimes "common sense" is not so "common". Overall, I always enjoy purchasing from Amazon, and I am very satisfied with my choice! <end>  Star of David  I received 2 Stars of David and Cross necklaces and I am very pleased with this company. <end>
 B00064UU8W  Blue Dragon Surfboard Surfing Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Blue Dragon Surfboard pewter pendant necklace  The dragon was black not blue. It was the blue dragon that appealed to me. I had to give it as a gift <end>
 B00064UUBY  Bear Claw Paw Print Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Great bear jewelry  A really nice piece of bear jewelry from the well crafted pewter bear claw pendant to the adjustable cord. It's a nice size without being ostentatious and has a nice weight to it. Looks good when dressed up or dressed down. <end>  Attractive and Good Quality  This pewter bear pendant is good quality. I have received several compliments on it. It is Oval, not Round, but is well-balanced. A good buy for us bears.  ) <end>  Love it  The pendant is a good solid piece of construction. The items looks just like the picture online. My daughter loves it. <end>  Really cute necklace...  I picked this up as a stocking stuffer for a teenage girl. She loves it!!! It's relatively heavy and seems well made. The necklace is cloth, but seems to be sturdy enough for daily wear... <end>  Bear Claw necklace  I bought this for my son. He loves and wears it practically every single day. The black cord makes it easily adjustable to be worn long or short. The pendant is slightly oval which would make it bigger than, say, a quarter by an 1/8 of an inch on right and left sides if you were to lay a quarter on top of it to measure it. <end>  looking for bear paw jewelry  There are few sources for realistic and quality "silver" jewelry that represent bear paws for me. I was disappointed that this piece was not sterling. It is a bit coarse in fabrication (which is fine, since it will not be worn as "fine jewelrey", but I was expected a somewhat smaller pendant in precious metal. I'm happy to wear it, but would definitly NOT recommend the cheap leather cord that comes with it. I removed it and purchased a rubber cord with silver crabclaw clasp, and I'm much happier. Overall, it's a fun piece to wear, and a good conversation starter when folks want to ask if I'm a bear hunter, which I am. Then the stories begin to flow.............. <end>
 B00064UUD2  Buffalo Skull Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Bullish On This Pendant  I bought three pendants at the same time from the same source (Dan's Jewelers), and this one is my favorite. It's just the right size to have hanging on my neck, and it looks great. I love all things Old Western, and nothing says it better than a bull buffalo skull. The only complaint I have about this particular pendant was that it had a very sharp burr on the tip of one horn. And, when I say sharp, it was sharp enough to cut you if you inadvertently came in contact with it. (You don't think I cut my finger on it on purpose, do you?) A finger nail file applied to the burr removed it immediately, but left a small shiny spot on the pendent. Not a big deal, but the burr shouldn't have been there. Still didn't stop me from really liking this pendant. <end>
 B00064UUDW  Knife Through Heart Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Beautiful pewter Jewelry  This is a beautiful piece of jewelry, with fine detail and makes for a great look. As a fan of pewter jewelry, I find it a bit difficult to find in stores and often too pricey or of inferior quality. Not this one! Beautiful, solide craftsmanship and very reasonably priced. Love it. <end>
 B00064UUG4  Gay Triangle Rainbow Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Excellent gay pride jewelry  Wow - what a great piece at an exceptional price. As a fan of pewter jewelry, I was looking for something (new) to wear during Gay Pride Month. This caught my eye as possibly "just the thing" - and it really is. Even the black cord was perfect - I abandoned my original plan of putting in on a purple chain I have. I ordered a few other pieces from Dan's Jewelers and they were all of excellent quality at such a truly reasonable price. Highly recommended. <end>
 B00064UUI2  Marines Symbol Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Awful  I Purchased this item for my youngest son of 6 children. He is going into the Marine Corps, delayed entry program. The rope broke and the eagle broke in half. Should my family see this as a bad omen?Will Not buy again <end>  Terrible  I really wanted to like this. The metal bends, the material of the necklace is made of plastic, buy another Globe and Eagle necklace. Absolutely terrible. <end>
 B00064UUK0  Unique Killer Whale Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Cute  The pendant was small, but I liked it that way so that it wasn't obnoxious or anything.It's very detailed.I also liked that the string was adjustable.Although I don't recommend it was men...  ( <end>  Love My Orca!  I am very pleased with my orca pendant. The detail is really good. I wasn't crazy about the cord it came on...I wore it that way a few times & then put the pendant on a silver chain. The chain really accented the beauty of the pendant. <end>  Overall, it's really great  I was really happy to see this unique-looking whale pendant. A lot of killer whale pendants look like fat dolphins, but this one actually looks like an orca! Awesome!I was slightly disappointed in the differences between mine and the photo. The rostrum (nose part) of the whale in the picture looks really well done, but mine looks messy where it was soldered and is rounded like a beluga. Also, the loop at the top has a line down the middle, which is fine, but it is different than the photo. Mine also had a slightly sharp bit off side of the tail. Just be aware that the finished pieces aren't necessarily perfect, but for the amazing price, you really can't beat it!That said, I wear it often, almost every day. I love it because it looks like a WHALE. I love it so much that I got a second one to send to my friend who works at SeaWorld. She loves it too! <end>
 B00064UUKA  Detailed Scorpion Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Pewter Scorpion Pendant  Not too expensive. Nice details. No defects. Speedy service. Can't really find any problems with this. I would probably do business again. No chain though. <end>
 B00064UULY  Black & White Yin Yang Pewter Necklace ||	  Big Bang for your buck!  I bought this necklace for my teenage daughter and her classmates that are performing a drumline routine with a ying yang theme. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality for less than $10! The necklace cord is adjustable so each individual can adjust it to his/her preferred length. <end>  My Daughter Loved IT  Got this for my daughter for Christmas, it is not a shiny, bling thing. It is softer, pewter. Very nice! <end>  Love this  This pendant is the perfect size and price. Just what I was looking for. Might like to put on a different chain or leather cord, but nice for the price. <end>  OK  A little cheap looking, but for the price you can't complain. All other items from this seller were fine. Shipping was timely. <end>  Just arrived - this is huge and gorgeous ! Great for guys or girls !!  Just arrived and i'm super happy. This thing is very large, sturdy, looks gorgeous and super expensive, great quality details on pendant. Was planning to use on a nice thick silver chain i already have, but now i'm not sure i'll do that. It comes tied in place on a woven thick string cord. Actually it's a dual cord system with slip knots, so you can adjust to any size, slip over our head, then shorten the length back up. Very cool - guys will love this !! Only downside is to get pendant off you have to cut it off and ruin the necklace part, so i'm thinking i'll just wear as is. <end>  Impressive product  This was very nice. I received it in better condition than I thought. Hope to do business with this person again <end>  Nice  for the price. It is well made and solid. Perfect for my kids. <end>
 B000658EVQ  14 KT Yellow Gold High Polished Ball 10mm 14k Stud Post Earrings ||	  I love these earrings!  I love these earrings! They are just big enough to truly make a statement. They are very comfortable and easy to wear. I would buy from Gem Avenue again. Thanks for the great service! CW <end>  size matters  wanted a gold 10mm earring, found them here. when they arrived was taken by the beauty. came to me fast., boxed right and very balanced on the post. backs are good and not junk. I paid for what I received and size does matter. <end>  I purchased Gold pierce earrings twice.  Excellent,very fast delivery!! I ordered gold earrings twice and both times, I was very pleased to receive them in such a speedy delivery. This seller aims to please. Thanks! Carole <end>
 B000659OJ2  14k Yellow Gold Rope Bracelet w/Heart Toggle, 7.25" ||	  Attractive, But Needs A Little Work  I ordered this for my wife for her birthday as she loves heart jewelry. I thought it would be a double win since she also tends to have trouble fastening bracelets by herself (as we all do). However, when she but the bracelet on and began moving around, the toggle slipped out of the heart. Thinking it was a fluke, she put it back on and the same thing happened within a few seconds. The heart is a little too big and the toggle easily slips out with very little movement. We have another gold heart of a similar size that my wife plans on taking to a jeweler and have soldered onto the bracelet's gold heart in such a way that will make the opening smaller and keep the toggle in place. <end>  Bad Quality and Design  I bought this bracelet for my girlfiend to commerorate the birth of our son but it did not last. The bracelet heart clasp is entirely too large for one. Second the material is of poor quality, while wearing the bracelet my girlfriend got it caught in her sleeve and 3 quarters of the bracelet unraveled. Now like others purchasers i'm stuck with this hunk of garbage. <end>  Poor Design  The appearance of this is stunning however, there is no way this bracelet will stay on. The heart toggle, which makes the rope bracelet different, is not designed to stay together. The toggle is too small and will not stay thru the heart, allowing the bracelet to fall off the wrist. I took it to 2 jewelers who could not find a fix, now I have a bracelet I love decorating my jewelery box. <end>  Not the quality I expected  I returned this product. The piece was very light weight and didn't have a feel of quality at all. I bought it for my wife and she always loves everything I give her and even she agreed that it felt like gold plated plastic.I have decided never to buy jewelry online again. Not just because of this experience but others as well. The photos are enhanced to make it look so good but they never look like that when you get them. <end>  too easy to lose  very lovely, but toggle is too small to hold in the heart & bracelet falls off. Not a good thing. <end>
 B000659OME  14k Yellow Gold 10mm Double Link Charm Bracelet, 7" ||	  A Charming Bracelet  I bought this for a Christmas gift for my wife and I am very happy with it. It is a great price for this wider women's bracelet. Heavy duty lobster type clasp is a real plus!!! <end>  Beautiful  It was just what I was looking for and a good value for the money!! <end>
 B00065A194  Cute Stretchy Mixed Gemstone Bracelet ||	  stretchy bracelet  The bracelet is very cute and a great value. I gave several as gifts and they were well received! <end>
 B00065FYRS  Iron Maltese Cross Pewter Friendship Ring Rings ||	  it's ok but it's not bad  it could be better and it could be silver for the same price. now that's a consept <end>
 B00065FZGI  Bones Skull Head Bone Dark Goth Pewter Ring ||	  Fun, But Could Be More Adjustable  I received this as a present, and was quite thrilled. It is a quirky and fun ring, however I have small fingers (Size 5-6) and when I tried to adjust the ring by squeezing it to fit, it felt like the ring was going to snap. I recommend this ring, but feel that it is better suited for Size 7 and larger, hence the lower rating. <end>
 B00065FZR2  Unique Skull Skeleton King Detailed Pewter Ring ||	  Nice!  Love this ring! I bought it with the skeleton hand ring and this one is just as awesome. It is big so if you like dainty this is not the ring for you. Probably more directed towards men, but I love it. It is very unique and took me a while to find anything like it. This is the only place I found a ring like it. <end>  llittle disappointed but still...  Picture of ring looks nice but i received a different ring than the one shown, i got one with all its teeth and triangle nose.... Still a very nice ring so that's why i gave it 4 star but if you have your heart set on the one shown you may be disappointed. <end>  I like it  The ring has a nice weight to it, without being too heavy. If that makes sense. It is pretty solid as well.What was shipped to me was very similuar, but was a different ring. The shipped had all its teeth and a triangle noses cavity. Not a big deal, it just seemed a little odd. <end>  Impressive ring  This is a large, heavy ring with a unique style that definitely makes an impact. You won't forget you're wearing it. One reviewer noted the pewter has a duller, more burnished finish than silver; this is true but I am fine with this - a shiny silver finish would probably put this over the top. The sizing on the ring is large - I wear (and ordered) a 13, but it is big, and I'm trying to figure out how to add a spacer to get it to fit more snugly. (I looked into returning it for an exchange, but 1/2 sizes don't seem to be available.) Excellent price for the ring. Extremely prompt shipping. Except for the sizing issue, a great purchase, and an excellent transaction with the seller. <end>  Dull and Heavy!  If you wear silver as I do, then a pewter ring looks odd on your finger, as it is dull gray and not shiny whatsoever. This ring fits well and looks fine, but the finish is dull and the ring is super heavy! I have received compliments on it though, and I like it, but you definitely know you have it on! <end>
 B00065FZS6  Heart Key Lock Friendship Love Pewter Pendant ||	  Very unique!  I get a lot of compliments for this one, it's a nice stainless metal and comes with a thick black string that is adjustable. It's cute to wear in 3 ways  with the two pieces together, the block alone, or the key alone. <end>
 B00065FZVS  Nice Celtic Knot Pattern Irish Pewter Ring Band ||	  Pretty ring  Ring may run a little small, and the pattern doesn't quite make it all the way around the ring. It wasn't a bad purchase for the price, however. <end>  Malleable  I got this ring as a valentines present for my boyfriend. He loves the ring though he was playing with it one day and noticed even a little preasure can cause it to start bending. Overall though I love it, he is a musician so it has handled being worn while playing guitar and even being run up and down the strings without loosing the design. It also survived a trip through the washer and dryer. <end>  ring  I received this ring yesterday,and I'm satisfied with it.I recommend this seller,bc I've ordered 3 times from them,and i was pleased with the jewelry all 3 times. <end>  good value  The design doesn't go all the way around--there is a smooth spot a little less than a 1/4 inch. I knew that when buying this, though, as someone else put that fact in their review. It doesn't bother me, although the spot has already gotten a little scratched from the ring on the adjacent finger rubbing against it. Again, no worries. No one sees that part anyway, and the ring is keeping its shape well. Also, the size was accurate, which is something I always worry about when ordering rings online. So very happy with that part.Overall, for the price, very worth it and happy with the ring. <end>
 B00065FZWC  Powerful Big Iron Cross Maltese Axe Pewter Ring ||	  BUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ring would be perfect if it looked like the one in the picture...The ring i received looks unfinished ... The side crosses needed more edging... Also the black shading is lacking on both sides and top...i will not bother contacting Amazon or seller for it is not worth my time or money to have shipped back... I will try to add more shading myself... If this ring is NOT the exception i do not recommend it... <end>  Nice Ring  The ring arrived on time and fits great. As another reviewer has noted, the black etching is not so dark. I don't find this to be much of an issue, but I did knock off one star for it. Else, I am happy with the ring. <end>
 B00065G09E  Flaming Grim Reaper Skull Head Pewter Pendant ||	  Given as a gift  Given as a gift, which was very well received. People compliment the wearer and a lot of positive comments. (Better than I expected) <end>
 B00065G0EE  Cute Cuddly Teddy Bear Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Dlec  I love teddy bears and I love this necklace. The bear is sooo cute and super detailed. The rope chain is sturdy and adjustable so you can wear it with any style top. Best purchase for bear lovers ever. <end>
 B00065G0FI  Fleur De Lis Steel Body Jewelry Barbell ||	  Nice!  This fleur de lis barbell was a little shorter than I expected, but I may not have read the description well enough. I was afraid it wouldn't fit in my piercing, but it did--though since the fleur is a separate piece, it took a little finesse to get both parts on. When I did finally get it all set up, I was thoroughly pleased with how it looks and how light it is. <end>
 B00065G0GM  Fibonacci Fractal Chaos Math Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Crop Circle Pendant  This lovely, pewter pendant came very quickly. It is a nice solid pendant and perfectly described in the description by seller. I would recommend this seller to others. <end>  Fibonacci Numbers Interesting Stuff  Fibonacci Numbers if you don't know find out0+1=1..1+1=2..1+2=3..2+3=5..3+5=8..5+8=13Can you follow that ?This patteren is also known as the finger print of GodVery nice pieceGreat necklace <end>  Perfect gift for a math geek.  The pendant is well made and big enough to clearly see the design. It does come packaged on a black cord so it can be worn upon arrival.Got this for a newly minted math education graduate. She loved it so much she put it on immediately. I think her favorite part was explaining what a fractal is to the mathematically uniformed at our table. ;-) <end>  Math necklace  My daughter and son in law are math people and I was delighted to give her this necklace. She enjoys wearing it with her Pi earrings just to see who notices. <end>  Exactly what I needed  My mom's a math teacher and loves teaching Fibonacci numbers. This was a great Christmas gift  very reasonable price, arrived on time, came with a neat little pouch to put it in, good quality. She loved it. <end>  Great item  A well made attention getting, this piece is a great gateway piece that leads to plenty of questions and discussions. If you want somthing that your friends probably have never seen before and looks good this is for you. <end>  Must have one of a kind necklace.  Need I say more? It's simple and a great conversation starter because everyone wants to know what the designs all about. Highly recommended.Great with shipping time too. I am definitely going to be buying more, probably even today! <end>
 B00065G0PI  Celtic Unicorn Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Very nice piece  This necklace arrived well packaged and is large and sturdy enough for frequent wear. I am very happy with the detail and the sie of it. The cord is adjustable so you can make it longer or shorter depending on your needs. I would definitely buy more. <end>  Celtic Unicorn Pewter Pendant Necklace  I bought the Celtic Unicorn Pewter Pendant Necklace for my granddaughter and she was thrilled and loved the gift. I have purchased other Celtic jewelry and haven't been disappointed with any of the jewelry.Thanks! <end>
 B00065G0Q2  Southwestern Style Owl Arrowhead Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  owl  I rc'vd my order the same week I placed it!!!!!! One of the few on line Xmas gift oders that did arrive in time for The BIG day!!!!! <end>
 B00065G0QC  Celtic Rabbit Hare Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Nicer than expected  I bought this as a Christmas gift, so I can't speak about how it holds up to wear and tear, but the pendant itself is very nice -- moreso than I expected. The pattern is sharp and clear and the pendant has a good weight to it. I kind of want to get one for myself now. <end>  Beautiful!  I purchased this for my wife's birthday, as she is wild about all things rabbit. Both of us were exremely pleased with this item  exceptional quality, right price, fast shipping. What's not to love? <end>  Celtic Rabbit Pendant  I was quite pleased with the quality of the workmanship, the low price, and prompt delivery. <end>
 B00065G0XA  Bird Skull Pewter Finger Armor Spike Ring ||	  Decently Well Made  I didn't expect miracles, but this ring was quite nice for the price. Of course, the post office wasn't very nice to it, so it arrived bent. It is pewter, so the ring is very malleable. I really like the way it looks, and wish it fit a little better. <end>  My new common accessory.  This was a very pleasing sight, was exactly what I desired and limbers up quite quickly. I got the small black pouch when I ordered and I got this armor that fits snug on my ring finger, which was unexpected as I assumed it would be too small. The metal is clean and strong, bends easily, holds around my finger, and is exactly what I ordered. <end>  love it but still not abel to wear it.  so i'm a girl and wanted an armor ring, i fell in love with the bird's skull and wanted it!i knew it'd had to be resized for my tiny fingers but i still went ahead and ordered it, it did say "adjustable" after all.it's beautiful beyond words! but not as adjustable as i would like. i took it to a jeweler to try to get it fixed but since it's pewter, jeweler wants nothing to do with it and says it'll get ruined if he messes with it....soooooi'm in need of a new jeweler so that i can finally wear it.  (( <end>  Good  When I first saw this I thought it looked really cool. And when I got it, it was a lot bigger then I thought. It fits well on my middle finger but it is a little thin. The metal is also a little maluable but unless you play with it, I don't think it would be a problem.Which finger you will be able to put it on depends on your finger sizes. My friends can only put it on their ring fingers but they have bigger fingers. <end>  Great Product  It looks really cool and I love the fact that it's resizable. I've been getting these kinds of rings for a while but with most it's just a get it and hope it fits thing. I love this ring. <end>  some unhappyness  excellent product. i love the look of the dead, decaying bird scull but im unhappy of the shipping time. for some reason shipping from Las Vegas Nevada (where its shipped from) to South Lake Tahoe, California (destination) took longer than an item coming from Indiana. and I ordered the Indiana product a day later than this product. <end>  bird skull finger armour ring review  The shiping was great it didn't take long, but the rings quality left much to be desired. the hinges are weak both the first one on the right side and the last one broke... you could see that there wasn't much material holding it together in the first place... but the rest of the hinges held. <end>  Top not if not a little small  First of all the speed of arrival was excellent as was the condition of the product. The main problem I had was that ring spikes require a larger ring size and I didn't know it at the time so I have to wear it on another finger <end>
 B00065G1AM  Celtic Owl Uath Hawthorn Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Nice quality slight flaw  I like this but,one of the owls has a weak stamping.It was the upside down owl and you wouldn't even notice it unless you looked hard enough.Find your friends birthday and match up his/her celtic sign and get one of these this as a gift. <end>  Good  It's a nice pewter pendant, did not exceed expectations in anyway. It is sufficient, but nothing really special. Would be better in a more expensive metal or with cut-outs maybe. It looks exactly like the picture. <end>  Uath  Love the pendant! Wear it all the time. I really liked that the cord came pre-knotted so I didn't have to fool around with it. <end>  Classy  Another nice looking pendant.After wearing it for a while I hungthis from my cars rearview mirror.I love the adjustable length black cordit's attached to. <end>  gift  Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loved it and wares it all the time. The necklace is adjustable, so she can ware it with many differant neck lines. I thought the Owls were a little difficult to see, but if my daughter is happy, so am I. <end>
 B00065G1C0  Fire Dragon Head Flames Flame Pewter Bracelet ||	  Great gift  A lovely gift for any man who appreciates oriental-style dragons, who is a fan of renaissance faire-style jewellery, or who simply likes a nice, weighty piece featuring dragons. This was sent as a gift, and the recipient was very pleased, but some slippage around the wrist was noted. Those with a more willowy frame may find this too large a piece, but those of huskier builds will find that it sits well. <end>  Pretty Unusual  FIRE DRAGON Head Flames Flame Silver Tone PEWTER BRACELETDefinately Different & Unusual. The only complaint that I have is that the metal is very pliable and seems fragile when I adjust it to take it on or off. <end>
 B00065G1CK  Crescent Half Moon Star Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  broke within 2 days  i bought this for 13 year old daughter and after two days she brought it to me the hook on top had broke. I did not save the receipt so I'm unable to file a claim. <end>
 B00065G1CU  King Arthur Knight Pewter Finger Armor Ring (Hinge may differ) ||	  the ring was received on time, but....  i was expecting something of higher quality. i ordered this because it looks exactly like a piece i used to have, but this ring was poorly made; the hinges are not even, which doesn't allow the ring to bend properly. i don't know what material it's made of, but it is *not* pewter. it is far too fragile. <end>  Great ring but order a size bigger than normal.  I wish I had ordered a size larger than i needed. It fits like normal but I cant really bend my finger like I should because it gets to tight. For price it is a good deal. <end>  NEVER Received the item  It has been over a month now - and I have not received this item!Also - another similar item I purchased from the same vendor fell apart just hours after I put it on.No tracking information on the items - either. <end>  very cool, but very big  i thought this ring was very cool, but when i got it, it was way too big and i can't wear it! I see now where the sizing is listed, but i would suggest putting it much higher or maybe even in the title.the ring is awesome though! <end>  Disproportionate and painfull.  This ring looks very cool although the silver looks much darker than the picture, more like pewter (looks like). The ring I received was a size 12. I'm a 10 1/2 on my ring finger and it was way too big, but too small for my middle finger.The ring on that lays past the knuckle and towards the fingernail is the same size as the ring that sits on the base. What this does winds up doing is leaving part of the ring that is supposed to bend still in the air because I was able to bend my whole finger and not even move the hinges of the ring.Also the hinges are very painful due to the odd spikes they use to fasten it together. After four minutes of wear I had large indents in my knuckle. Remind you thats with the ring being about two sizes too BIG. Imagine if this actually fit my finger.The delivery was fast and the sales rep I got was very nice and is allowing me to exchange for a different ring that hopefully will fit and not be as painful. I don't know about Dans' other jewelery but this one stinks. Just don't buy it. <end>
 B00065G1LG  Southwestern Style Eagle Arrowhead Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  necklace review  the pendant was very nice but the neck length wasn't long enough. but the seller was really good and service was excellent <end>
 B00065G1MK  Rasta Lion King Reggae Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  RASTA LION PENDANT  IT IS BY FAR ONE OF THE GREATEST PENDANTS THAT I CAN SAY I'M VERY PROUD TO WEAR. <end>  It's very Large!  It's a nice pendant if it was white gold it would have been even better. Its not really something you want around your neck. It's very large. It was really cheap though. <end>  big  alot bigger than I thought, more something you would hang on rearview mirror than wear. Cheap almost plastic-looking <end>  excelent look!!!  heavy, strong and it looks just good.. i would get other products like this one.. it has a black shade which makes it looks vintage. <end>  To Darn Big  This Pendant is cool, but its huge. Its like putting a "pie plate" on your neck.I think it would be a bit better if it were smaller. <end>  Love it!  It's a great pendant, very good quality! The string for the necklace was poor quality but very easy to replace. <end>  GREAT!!!  The price was good for the pruduct. My best friend saw it on my neck and he was impressed. His wife bought it for him secretly and he love it dearly. The size is perfect for a metro style dress guy. <end>  beautifully crafted  This is a well made, nice looking pendant. The finish is beautiful and it has some weight to it too. I scored it 4 rather than 5 only because I think it would be more attractive if it were a bit smaller. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions before buying as it is a bit large and I don't generally wear big jewelry. <end>  love it!  just got it in the mail yesterday and i love it! already got compliments on it...beautiful necklace, my favorite by far!give thanks and praise to the most high JAH RasTafari!!! <end>  Great Gift for that special Rasta in your life  I purchased this item for my husband as a gift and what a great gift it was! He loves it and wears it most every day! I know plenty of his friends would like to know where to get one for themselves! <end>
 B00065G1O8  Cool Lizard On Fang Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Looks cool, hurts me though  I bought this for my boyfriend a while back. It looks very nice, but the problem is that when he hugs me, it pokes and hurts me. Sooo he doesn't wear it too often  PThis would be great for someone without a boyfriend/girlfriend or someone that doesn't hug too often lol because it looks very nice. <end>  Cool lizard on fang pewter pendant necklace  I love this pendant. I love lizards and geckos, as I live in the desert and have them at my home. I can wear it with most anything. <end>

 B00065G1U2  Celtic Knot Pattern Irish Thin Pewter Bracelet ||	  I wish I had paid more attention to the write up...  I purchased this for a graduation gift for an Irish young lady, but would not give it to her - just looks too inexpensive; almost like costume jewelery. I guess I just wasn't sure what a pewter, silvertone piece would look like.It's 'okay' for what I paid, but will not use it for the original purchase idea. <end>  Great Product  The product was exactly as advertised and I had no problems with anything. Thank you. <end>
 B00065G1VQ  Fantasy Spiked Yin Yang Art Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Arrived on-time and in good condition.  I bought this as a set with theBlack Crystal PENTAGRAM Silver Tone PEWTER Necklace. (The pentagram was for me, the Yin-Yang Pendant for my fiance'.) I bought this for my Fiance' because a previous review on the product said the pendant was kinda big and would probably be best suited for a man's necklace. The pendant arrived in excellent condition and it arrived in a timely manner. I am very pleased with this product. One small thing however; the spiky portions of the necklace are actually pretty sharp. Not enough to break the skin, mind. but I can imagine it would be unpleasant to be struck in the face with it when running. ^^' Altogether though, this product is beautifully crafted and is put together very well. <end>  ablsolutly loved  I got this for my boyfriend and he just loved it. He responded with a stare and then he tackled me with a huge hug. lol He couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it when I found this. I have never seen a yin yang pendant like it and I doubt I ever will again. It's amazing. <end>  solid  the pendant has a pretty reasonable price and is really solid. it is also masculine. only problem is pendant tends to flip around when you wear it but that is fixable <end>  Definitely gets noticed!  I have received *many* compliments on this piece. Definitely more for males due to the size/weight. The sharp parts can be a little dangerous. But wear it out to a bar or club and girls will be asking about it all night! <end>  BEAUTIFUL!  This is beautiful for both women and men... mostly men! lolit looks exactly like the pic and has the shadings on the pendant that corespond to the yin yang idea. very artistic, very hot! (I got this for my younger brother), the only thing is that the edges tend to be a little sharp, so don't sleep with it naked and if you did, don't blame it on the person who got you this gift!  ) <end>  Yin Yang Pendant  My son loves this pendant. He is a big guy and the rope that comes with it is plenty long enough for him. Great transaction. Item came very quickly. <end>  Art Work  Like wearing a piece of artwork. Very substatial and highly crafted. Iwould recommend it for males beacause it is big and fairly heavy.I have a piece I bought for $38 and this design is similar. Great for silver chain and for casual dress up. Tough to beat for the price!It definitely stands out. <end>  Looks like the picture  For the price its awesome. I guess necklaces just aren't my thing. I wore it once but didn't really enjoy wearing it so I never wore it again. I don't have anything bad to say about it though. Its just whatever in my opinion. I bought 3 other necklaces after this one and didn't really like them either so I guess I am just not a necklace guy. <end>  Unique & Stylish  The product I received was exactly as described. It is beautiful. It is very stylish and unique and the workmanship on it is of a high quality. I have used this seller before with no complaints and most certainly don't have any this time. <end>  So cool!  This is one of the coolest necklaces I have ever worn (I'm a guy) even if I have only worn this one! It's durable, sharp (be careful when hugging your significant other haha) and amazingly fit. The rope is adjustable so it will fit ANY head! TRUST ME! My head is big. <end>  ok and need work  CHEAP A** METAL this is about to break and its rusted in places but its kinda cool more yang than yin. <end>
 B00065G242  Southwestern Style Feather Pewter Pendant ||	  good piece at a great price.  This piece arrived very quickly and was nicer than what appeared online. It was also a little larger than what I expected but well worth the price. <end>  Good Find  This pendant is well made and handsome. Looks good on either men or women. Beautifully made <end>
 B00065H05W  Goth Skull Heads Punk Pewter Bracelet ||	  Beautiful Bracelet  I love this bracelet, but because my wrists are so very thin, I wear it pushed up my arm. It is very maleable, which is fine for ppl with normal to larger wrists, but I fear I will break it with much wear if I had to bend it to truly fit my tiny wrists as it is designed to do. It garners many compliments and can be worn casually or a bit more formally for either males or females. <end>  First day and it broke  The very first time I received it the bracelet was bended and I slightly bended and it broke than I noticed that the material was very bendable and more like cheap plastic. So if I was you don't buy it, it was just a waste of money. <end>
 B00065H0A2  Goth Skulls Pewter Ring Band ||	  RETURNED  Size of the ring was not correct, was way off of the normal size. Returned at a cost to me plus a restocking fee... <end>  Cool Jewels  A must have for a teenage Goth who has everything else. Plus, his skull earrings along with this pewter ring completed his ensemble. Neat gifts for the price- can't beat it... <end>  nice ring  this is the second one i bought for my boyfriend its a nice ring but still did not fit will have to try to buy him a bigger size but hey ill have the same ring now too because the first one i ordered did not fit him but it does me  ) <end>
 B00065H10Q  Scorpion Bug Claw Pewter Finger Armor Ring Spike ||	  metal too soft  it was crooked so i tried to bend it cuz it's soft metal and the fingertip segment broke off on one side. it's fine it still stays attached mostly and still looks neat. <end>  Just what I wanted!!!  I'm going as a Vampire for Halloween......LOL This will give me the look that I want & I plan to wear it to work. <end>  Not as cool as the pictures  Well the ring was to small for my finger length wise it needs one more tier in order to bend my finger in it. otherwise nice product <end>
 B00065LHHO  Sterling Silver July Birthstone Baby Brat Girl Pendant w/ Ruby Color Cubic Zirconia ||	  adorable!!  I bought two of these, one of each birthstone of my grand daughters to wear for myself like a "grandmother's necklace". They are the cutest and well worth the value. I really like them and love wearing them to think of the girls. <end>
 B00065LHIS  Sterling Silver April Birthstone Baby Brat Boy Pendant w/ Clear Color Cubic Zirconia ||	  GREAT GIFT!  I ordered this for my friend for Mother's day. It's her son's birthstone. She is so proud of showing off her pendent symbolizing her beautiful little boy and his birth-month. <end>
 B00065LHJC  Sterling Silver June Birthstone Baby Brat Boy Pendant w/ Alexandrite Color Cubic Zirconia ||	  Pendants  Very pretty and all but quite large pendants. If you have a small family it is great but if you are a family of 10 like ours it is too large for one necklace. <end>  sterling silver baby brat  Item was a bit smaller than the others I have. Wish there were some measurements to go by when ordering. <end>
 B00065LHZQ  Sterling Silver December Birthstone Baby Brat Boy Pendant w/ Blue Topaz Color Cubic Zirconia ||	  just what i was looking for  I,be been looking for these particular charms for 6 months. kohl keep sending me the wrong color. Finally I got the right one from amazon. <end>  Brat Boy  I purchased this for my daughter on Mothers Day. She flipped!!! She loves it so much and wears it everyday.Thank you! <end>
 B0006698BK  Freshwater Cultured White Rice Pearl Pendant ||	  Absolutely beautiful!  I love pearls but wanted something a little more contemporary and less "matronly" than a string of pearls, and this necklace is just gorgeous. Excellent craftsmanship, and the perfect size, this necklace is my new favorite. The chain it comes with is wonderful--delicate but strong. I highly recommend this beautiful necklace and cannot say enough good things about it! <end>  very pleased!!  i ordered this necklace as a christmas gift for my sister. i was afraid that the necklace would not be as pretty in person as it is on the website, but it really is beautiful. what you see in the picture is what you get. the necklace and pearl are both high quality which also surprised me b/c the price was so reasonable. and i liked it so much i had to try it on, and now i really want one for myself. it's not too fancy or tacky in anyway. the necklace came in a velvet drawstring bag inside a jewelery gift box, which isnt anything special so you might expect to go out and buy a nicer gift box if you plan to give it as a special gift to a loved one. overall, i give this product five stars for quality and wearability. <end>
 B00066D32A  Sterling Silver Sky Blue Color Evil Eye Bracelet ||	  Poorest Quality  The bracelet fell apart the first day. I emailed the seller and received no response. I would NOT purchase anything from this seller again. <end>
 B00066IXNY  Sterling Silver Amethyst Mystical Armor Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  COMFORT IS THE NAME OF THE GAME  COMFORT IS THE RIGHT WORD TO USE WHEN TALKING ABOUT THIS RING; NOT TO MENTION THAT IT LOOKS SO BOHO--LOVE THAT LOOK. AGAIN, THIS IS FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE SELLERS. THANKS SO MUCH REGARDS,DH <end>  Regret  I was shocked when I saw this ring, it was not what I expected. I have never seen a ring so small, not made for humans. it's something I'd expect in a bon bon at Christmas time.It's too tight for my pinky, the sizing is all wrong.I can't imagine them selling this item in a jewelry shop, very disappointing, not worth the money at all. I won't buy jewelry online anymore.A regret <end>
 B00066IY06  Sterling Silver Medieval Cross Armor Wide Ring Size 13(Sizes 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  Stunning Ring  This ring is truly stunning! I get compliments on it all the time, and unlike a lot of other wide rings, it's very, very comfortable. It's also very versatile as a woman's ring and as a men's ring, without being to bulky or flamboyant---just right! ;)However... the beautiful little details (the loops and the beads) are ever-so-slightly raised, so they tend to catch on clothing frequently. It's not really that big of an issue if you're careful, but still something to be wary of (as with just about any ring!). <end>  Love It  I love this ring. Its gorgeous and very different than other rings. Beautiful and noticeable. I am very happy with my purchase. <end>  Just as beautiful as the picture  I gave it as a gift and was told I had truly outdone myself. <end>
 B00066IY24  Sterling Silver Wizards Armor Ring in Garnet(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Too tight  Very tight ring, looks pretty nice but if you wear it it doesnt come off and you can hardly bend your finger because it is so big! Not for me... <end>  Very nice.  The Wizards Armor ring is an eye catcher. It looks better in reality than on the web image. I love it and I recommend it as an original piece of jewelry. <end>  Metal of ring quite insubstantial  The ring is pretty enough, but the metal of the ring is very insubstantial it pushes in very easily. <end>
 B00066ZWWY  Coaster Traditional Jewelry Armoire ||	  Very elegant piece!  This piece looks so elegant in our bedroom, and matches our cherry furniture very nicely. It is a very solid, heavy piece that does not look cheap at all! I was worried that it might, but when it arrived (in PERFECT condition, and no flaws at all) I was very surprised to find it has the look of fine furniture. I can even say it looks better than some thomasville furniture we have. It has plenty of drawers and compartments for all kinds of jewelry, and the swing open doors on the sides are great. This armoire is simply beautiful. You won't be disappointed! <end>  Pleased with product  I've had this for over a year now and have found nothing at fault with this armoire. The finish, style and construction are excellent. Does not look cheap at all, and has tons of storage. <end>  Beautiful, spacious jewelry armoire  I'm glad I purchased this jewelry armoire. It looks great and perfectly matches my other furniture. I definitely needed it, as it was becoming overwhelming looking through my jewelry. Now everything is perfectly organized. Good buy at a decent price. <end>  I love this jewelry box  I love this jewelry armoire! It has plenty of space, and I love that I can hang my necklaces now. Bonus, the "ring" handles on the drawers allow me to place a pole down through them to keep the kids out. <end>  Cheaply Made  To start with the product was damaged. Instead of sending it back I repaired it myself to reinforce areas that were put together with glue instead of nails. Side doors do not shut like they should. I had to install spacers so that the magnets would come in contact with the doors. It was not shipped in the original packaging which I think is why it was damaged. Poorly packaged. The item overall was of poor quality. <end>  Queen Anne  Service was excellent. Original item was damaged in shipment and the person I dealt with was very understanding and quick to replace it. My wife was very pleased with the item. <end>  Hardware required for assembly not included in the shipment.  I ordered this armoire for my wife for Christmas. Imagine my delight when I unpacked it on Christmas eve and discovered the the hardware required to assemble the product was not included in the box. It required bolts to secure the legs and screws to attach the mirrored lid. Other hardare to secure the product from tipping was also referenced in the assembly instructions. None of the hardware was provided. <end>  bad for the price!  the armoirw itself is nice. my biggest gripe is that the mirror on the inside of the lid fell off a week after i got it. i was pretty disappointed as this was a gift for my gf. she likes it though even though the mirrow fell off. ill just have to fix it myself. overall, this really wasnt worth the price. i shouldve gotten something similar at target wouldve spent less for the same stuff. <end>  Beautiful Piece of Furniture  This jewelry armoire is beautiful. The size is perfect if you do not have alot of wall space and it can be close to the wall even with the lid open. <end>  Great product  The jewelry armoire arrived in a timely fashion.It was double cardboarded on the corners so that nothing would be damaged. Great packing job! The armoire has nice details and is very pretty. It is a tad smaller than I expected but no matter, it holds a nice amount of jewelry and is very nice. I highly recommend it. <end>  nice for the price  I was very happy with quality for the price. it was just a bit smaller than the picture appeared. It was very easy to assemble <end>  Excellent!  I bought this jewelry armoire as a birthday present for my mom. It arrived quickly and was packaged perfectly. She absolutely loves it! The picture accurately depicts this piece. It even fits in perfectly with her more expense furniture! Since getting her this gift, my mom can't stop buying jewelry because she feels the need to fill it up! <end>  Very nice!  This piece is very nicely made and I just love it! I like the fact that it fits right into any corner or decourm. It's ability to hold a lot is deceiving because until you pull the sides out, you don't know either! It's nice quality with velvet insets in a olive green (which is a nice touch) and stores discreetly. Enjoy! <end>  beautiful frustration  The armoire is beautiful when all put together, but when it first arrived, there were some black marks on one of the doors and some pieces missing. When others where sent, they didn't fit right. In the end, my husband made it work, but we now have several extra parts. <end>  Poor quality, arrived broken  You get what you pay for, I guess. The armoire looks nice in the pictures, but in person the shoddy construction is extremely obvious. It's not made of wood; most of the body is made from particle board with wood veneer. The particle board is visible whenever any of the drawers are opened. The drawers themselves are also particle board with wooden face plates. When I unpackaged mine, I found that one of the drawer face plates had completely fallen off, and another was cracked. There are weird gaps between the drawer body and the face plate, that look like a design mistake that they tried to cover up. It also reveals that the drawers are not squared off properly, because the gaps are uneven on each side of the drawers. The hardware looks tacky, for example the drawer handles look like cheap bronze castings that were crudely screwed on with the type of cheap brass screws you get from home depot. The screws don't match the hardware - while the hardware has a faux antique finish, the screws are bright gold, not recessed, and highly visible.I'm actually kinda glad that mine arrived damaged because that means I get to return it. Two stars for now assuming they don't give me any trouble with the return; if I have trouble actually returning this I'll downgrade them to one star. <end>  Terrible Quality Fit and Finish  I was extremely disappointed with the poor construction quality in terms of fit and finish. The side doors and top mirror lid did not fit properly after assembly, there were noticeable uneven gaps when the doors/lid were open as well as closed. The finish was terrible. Several areas on the legs were not stained so there was an obvious color difference. Also the wood grain did not uniformly match on the various pieces. <end>  bad mirror  This is a beautiful jewelry armoire the only thing is when it arrived and my husband put it together, the mirror has brown spots on it like the glue or backing seeped through. I am keeping it because I dont want hassle of returning it. Other than the mirror I would reccomend this to anyone. It is so nice and hold alot of jewelry. <end>  Excellent Product and Well packaged  If you are looking for a solid Armoire, this product is for you. I bought this item as anniversary present for my wife. She loves it. It was easy to put together just ten minutes my wife was able to put this together herself. The product is very solid and does not not look cheap at all. I would recommend this product. The only problem is the shipping expense for this product, I wish Amazon has it in stock!! <end>  Excellent value  This is a beautiful heavy piece and very well made. I lucked up and found this one on sale right before Christmas, if you are looking for a great value this is it. I searched for hours to find one tall enough, most of the jewelry armoire's were way less than 40" tall. Granddaughter is very happy with it. <end>  Delivered as Promised  I had read a good number of reviews before purchasing this item. The biggest complaint was geared around delivery of the armoire because some were broken when customers opened their boxes. I must have been one of the fortunate ones because mine was not damaged or blemished. My wife likes this armoire very much and it looks great with our bedroom furniture. I would recommend this product to anyone. <end>  wedding gift  This was a wedding gift that the receipients recieved promptly and were very happy with. <end>  Pretty piece of furniture  The armoire is a pretty piece of furniture but smaller than I had expected. Unfortunately, I had to return it. My fault, I should have paid attenion to the measurements. <end>  IT WAS NOT RECEIVED IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME  ITEM WAS ORDERED ON DECEMBER 4, 2012, RECIEVED ON DECEMBER 29, 2012, , I WAS TOLD BETWEEN DECEMBER 13-18. I REALIZE THE STORM, BUT, THIS IS EXCESSIVE <end>  Ordered canceled for no apparent reason (seller review for Visiondecor Furniture)  I ordered this well in advance for a Christmas present, but was informed a week and a half before Christmas Day that my ordered was canceled without explanation. Will NOT attempt to buy anything from Visiondecor Furniture again! <end>  very late delivery - very disappointed  This is my first time ordering from Amazon, so it's a new experience. I'm not doing it again.I'd ordered a jewelry armoire for my sister for Christmas. The expected delivery date was December 5th at the latest, it's now the 13th! So a week later and not so much as a call.I had posted a review about this via an automated email request from amazon. I told them what had happened and not more than 6 or 7 minutes later I got a phone call.An Indian fellow was asking me to change my review. Seems that if Amazon/their sellers can't live up to their promises they shouldn't make them, rather than have their people make excuses.I'll not be doing business with them again and will go to a local furniture store next time.ps - this review will not be changed, even if they call. <end>  Beware of suspicious reviews!  I was considering buying this armoire, but after doing some detective work I found that the majority of the 5 star reviews, are those customers only reviews. Very fishy don't you think? <end>  &#34;Jewels Up&#34;  I have a lot of jewelry and I needed a place to store it and my family got it for me for Christmas! I have a lt of compartments and it helps store my precious jewelry. The mirror and drawers are great also! I really appreciate my family so much! <end>  oak Armoire  Great product very well made great product would recommend this product to anyone looking for this type product great for the price Thanks <end>  A very pleased customer.  I am very happy with the Armoire. It was very easy to put together and my wife just love's it. <end>  Jewelry Armoire  My wife really likes her new jewelry box. The finish is really nice and looks like real, solid oak. I think she would have liked to have more hooks for hanging necklaces but there is plenty of space in the drawers. My only complaint with it is the fact that it can't be put flush against a wall. When it is, the doors containing the hanging jewelry will not open as they extend behind the back of the unit. It needs to sit off the wall by two or three inches. Overall, though, this is a really nice, functional piece. <end>  Jewelry Armoire  This was one of the XMAS presents for my wife, it matches our bedroom furniture perfect & my wife loves it. <end>  Perfect choice my mother  I purchased this piece for my 87-year-old mother. I noticed excellent reviews, but my concern was whether it would arrive without any dings or scratches. The unit did arrive in perfect shape. It took less than 10 minutes to assemble (with minimal tools required - I think I just needed a screwdriver.) The build quality was excellent. All drawers and hinged components had a solid feel and articulated perfectly. My mother was thrilled.This is an excellent value. <end>  Nice Armoire  Very nice Armoire, was a week late getting here, the lid is smashed, the side compartment was ripped off the hinge. What a joke. <end>  Excellent!!!  My wife loves the style and beauty of her new jewelry armoir. Excellent construction and holds all of her stuff and then some. Definently a very good buy anf the price was great. <end>  Good purchase  Product was well constructed and the few items that needed assembly were simple to do. Looks great!! Was a Christmas gift forGranddaughter. She loves it. <end>  Wasnt the quality i expected  I ordered this because it looked real nice and when i opened it the wood on a couple of the drawers were lifted so i was kinda upset. You pay this much you expect better quality. <end>  Queen Anne  I did not rate this 5 was because it suffered slight damage to one drawer in the front. This was purely an in transit scrape but not enough for me to send back. The velvet in the drawers did not look new, but once I filled them it didn't matter. Some of the drawer edges are not as smooth as I would have liked. However the overall appearance is beautiful and I am still quite pleased with it. Adds a bit of elegance. <end>  Works Well  The product is very nice. Easy set up. Just add legs and mirror. Not as tall as expected. <end>  Great Piece of Furniture for a Reasonable Price  The product was delivered to me in excellect condition. It was easy to put together as I only had to screw the legs on and the mirror on top. The armoire gives our bedroom an elegent touch. I had bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. I'm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it. <end>  Armoire beautiful - however - broken to bits  The armoire itself was a beautiful choice for a christmas present. However, upon receipt I found it smashed up during shipping.It has been noting but a headache to work with them to get my money back. I did receive a refund however, I am still out excess shipping costs. <end>  coaster armoire (great piece for the price)  Ordered this piece for the wife for Christmas. First off, Amazon shipping is amazing, always fast and on time. There was alot of talk about damaged units being shipped, I luckily did not have this issue. the quality was better than anticipated. Has a very solid feel, no press board here. All the drawers and doors nicely lined and operate flawlessly. The only con is that I thought it would be a little taller. It was hard to size by the pictures and the only problem is I'm sure she will fill it quickly. if you have a large jewelry collection you may want a little larger. So look for a larger Coaster product and I'm sure they will not dissapoint. <end>  Great Piece of Furniture  This was a Christmas gift for my wife and is a great addition to our bedroom collection. The finish is a red oak and matched perfectly to our bedroom furniture group. The piece arrived very timely and was well wrapped. Other comments referred to the package arriving damaged and the furniture being damaged as well. The box was within another box and was very well cushioned. The carton had protectors on every corner and it literally took me 10 minutes to get them all off and be able to open the box. The piece assembles very quickly and is a very high quality. Drawers are nicely lined in felt, move in/out easily. The top and mirror were well constructed and add a nice touch. The pull out sides offer lots of nice storage for necklaces. Overall this was a great buy! Good price, great shipping and high quality unit. A definite 5 start recommendation. <end>  Elegant and Beautiful!  This jewelry armoire is so beautiful. It came so fast, and it's so easy to put together. It looks so elegant and well-made, the only thing is that it's light cherry color. It has plenty of room for all my jewelries and accessories. I love it! <end>  Cherry Armoire  This armoire is beautiful...just what I was looking for; however, I did not find the color to be "Cherry" or anything close to it. It was actually closer to the color of a medium oak. But since I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back and paying additional shipping charges, I gave the armoire to my daughter, who said it suited its purpose. She enjoys having the mirror that's attached to the flip-top. <end>  its unsteady  This jewelry box is unsteady and you must connect it to the wall with the screw provided in the box or it will fall over. However, it is inexpensive in comparison to others. Therefore, it may be worth the money. You get what you pay for. <end>  Broken Item  I ended up purchasing 2 of these units. The first one came in really quick and packaged very good. However when putting it together we noticed the left front door hinge was not installed correctly and when assembled in factory the person or machine ended up splitting the particle board with the screws. So we sent that unit back and got another. This unit came in again really quick and packaged nicely. Once again the left door was damaged by the hinge, wood actually split. Coaster has no Quality Assurance or Quality Control. These units look nice but Coaster needs to unpack then when they arrive from China and inspect them. Again Amazon did nothing wrong in fact I am impressed with Amazon for they way they handle returns. <end>  Armoire  I received the product on time as promised. I was surprised to find out there was some assembly required, however it only took about 10 minutes to attach the legs. There weren't any scratches I was pleased with the Armoire. If it had came assembled, it would have been perfect. <end>  Very Nice  I'm very happy with this purchase. The jewelry box is exactly as described, good quality and very easy to assemble. It arrived quickly and was very well packed. <end>  Jewelry Armoire  This arrived in mint condition. It was easy to put together and well packaged. It was to arrive in 3 to 5 business days, but it did take 10 days to arrive. Other than that I am very pleased with it. <end>  Beautiful piece of furniture  I received this jewelry armoire today and I love it. It is a beautiful oak finish and shows beautifully.Plenty of room for all my jewlery and a nice piece of furniture to show off. Thanks for the wonderful product. <end>  Very solid and very easy to assembly.  This item arrived and looks better than the picture. It is built solidly. The assembly was very easy, and that was what I was probably most pleased with. My wife loves it!! No problems at all with it. Have had it for about a month now. <end>  Beautiful  Love the product. It was purchased as a gift for my grandma. She was very happy with the style and craftsmanship of the box. I would definetly purchase other products from this vendor. <end>  Couldn't Be More Pleased  I agonized over buying this piece because it's a little scary to buy any kind of furniture without seeing it in person. But given the photos, reviews, and the price, I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. The item came well packaged and was simple and quick to assemble. I am very impressed with the quality of this item and I am *not* easily impressed. It looks as good or better than so many of the more expensive jewelry armoires I've seen in stores. The oak finish is true to the color in the picture. I'm really glad I bought this jewelry box. It's SO nice and so worth the price! <end>  Review of Armoire  The item arrived promptly and was well packaged. It was just as advertised and we are very satisfied with it. <end>  Good product  Arrived well packaged, minor problem with receiving shipping notice, was addressed quickly by manufactor customer service department, have enjoyed using it, it is actually slightly bigger than I had expected so I was very pleased with all the space it provided. Is a nice looking furniture piece. <end>  Jewelry Armoire  Received the Oak Armoire in a timely manner and it was very easy to assemble. All parts were here and in 15 minutes it was together. The drawers and storage doors all fit well, and it is a nice looking piece of furniture. Well worth the price. <end>  Coaster Traditional Jewelry Armoire  The finish was nice, it is very narrow and light weight so it does not sit properly on the rug where I have placed it. I have had to cut a piece of plywood and sit it on that, but it still is not very stable. I cannot mount on the wall where I have it sitting as the side door would hit and could not be used. <end>  Really pretty!  I was very, very happy with my purchase of this item. It came packed very well protected and I only had to install the legs and the upper-most lid (the one with the mirror), and that took all of about 10 minutes. The color is exactly as it appears on Amazon's website...a medium honey oak. It's the perfect size for a woman with a moderate amount of jewelry and not intrusive or excessively large (which worked out perfectly for our needs, but may not be enough room to satisfy a lady with a really large jewelry collection...but is perfect for someone with a moderate amount of jewelry or someone with smaller amounts who wants more room for future jewelry purchases or gifts).Highly recommended and a very good value for the money! <end>  Cherry Jewelry Armoire  I was disappointed with several aspects of this purchase. First I was told it would be delivered within two weeks of purchase. When the two weeks passed and I did not receive any notification as to a delivery date, I contacted the vendor. I was informed delivery would be delayed for several weeks. I believe the vendor should have notified me there would be a delay before I had to inquire about it. Second, when I finally received the armoire, one of the drawers was falling apart. Fortunately I was able to repair it because it would have been impossible to send it back to have it repaired. This was a disappointing purchase. <end>  Not very good quality.  I was very dissappointed with the quality of the jewelry box. The corners were not lined up very well and the screws that came with it to attach the lid were insufficeint. They pulled out of the holes after three lifts of the lid. When I tried to screw them in again the holes were to big and any bigger of a screw will crack the piece altogether. <end>  Christmas gift for my wife  i ordered this for my wife for christmas, and we both loved it. very simple to assemble (screw on the 4 legs and screw down the lid to the hinge), very solid, well build. would definitely recommend <end>  Beautiful!  This is a well built piece of furniture and matches nicely with the rest of my bedroom furniture. The only thing that disappoints me about it are most of the drawers do not have dividers in them, so my jewelry just sits in there loosely. Overall, however, it is sturdy and does have three areas with dividers and it does not take up a lot of room in the bedroom. <end>  Damaged upon Arrival  The armoire is very nice with minimal assembly required. Sadly when my first unit arrived the top had small chips in the wood and there was a substantial tear on the back. It was a bit odd because there was no damage on the outside and it was packed very well.I cannot say enough about the customer support. They were great in every respect. They had a replacement unit on the way post haste and my wife loves it!!!! <end>  gift  sent as a gift but they loved it!! i would reccomend it for others as well. Great color! easy to put together <end>  arrived damaged  My wife liked it but it had a giant scratch on the lid and the doors where coming off. Looks good put poor quality and I would not recommend it. <end>  Mom loves it  My mom really really loves this. As soon as it came in she went and swapped all her jewelry into this one and spent a few hours organizing every little piece. <end>  pleased, with slight problem  the piece looks great and has more than adequate storage. the only problem was the bottom drawer face was broken off. But a little gorilla glue fixed it and all I had to do was screw on the legs. would recommend this seller and product. <end>  Great quality jewelry armoire  This is well-made jewelry armoire. The wood is solid and heavy. The only thing was that the mirror came off when it arrived but that may have been due to the fact that it was so cold when it arrived. The mirror was not broken. <end>  Excellent Purchase  We ordered this as a Christmas present, not really knowing what to expect. It arrived in a well packed box with lots of reinforcing cardboard. It was in perfect condition and easy to assemble. We are as pleased as we can be with it and hope the gift recipient will be as well. Nice wood veneer, a good height, and a sturdy feel. <end>  glad I ordered early  I ordered this early for my daughter for Christmas. Glad I did becausewhen I took it out of the box, the front had several chips from the wood.I had to repack it and send it back. I received another one, no chips inthis one but the mirror on the top lid was not sealed to the lid and hada broken corner. It must have been broken before being shipped because themissing piece was not in the box anywhere. So, now I'm waiting for anothermirror that I will have to glue in myself. The armoire is very nice and a goodbuy for the money, the shipping procedure needs to change. <end>  pretty  very pretty it was what i wanted and more.i would buy from seller againthanksbob <end>  very pleased  I love this item. It was exactly what I was hoping for, and came in a timely manner. There was a slight scracth across the lid, but not enough to notice without really looking hard. Overall, I was very pleased. <end>  a beautiful gift  i sent it to my sister as a birthday present and - she loved it! delivery was just in time and everything else worked out beautifully. i am very pleased with the handling of this order. <end>  Love the storage  I love this Jewelry Armoire. Most do not seem to have the storage for long necklaces, this one does! So simple to find what I want to select without the muss and fuss of digging through othere items and the tangle jewelry can certainly create.Great product, I love it! <end>  jewelry armoire  This product is great. I love the space I have for my jewelry now. My necklaces are not all jumbled up in a knot, they can hang in the panels on the sides. It came promptly and was packaged really well. <end>  Good Experience  We had been looking for an armoire like this for a while and decided to chance ordering it on Amazon as a gift. Unfortunately it arrived a little damaged, but we had already carried it up three flights of stairs and settled it into the spot meant for it to be. So my husband just fixed it and it looks pretty good.When furniture cove wrote for feedback, I was honest and they offered to refund me part of the cost for the item since it arrived damaged. I appreciate them checking up on it and following through with something positive.It was a good experience and I would order from them again.The armoire is perfect, by the way. <end>

 B00067PCJQ  Sterling Silver 5 mm High Dome Wedding Band Thumb Ring ||	  Great Shopping Experience  I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience with buying these rings. It was easy and convenient to order, and my shipment arrived so quickly that I was stunned. I am a very satisfied customer. <end>  High domed and attractive, drawbacks of silver hold it back  I purchased a Palladium ring elsewhere as my wedding band. I wanted something to wear when working with my hands, when damage to the ring is likely. I bought this, and a 5mm Stainless band. The stainless band is nicer for a few reasons. First, the silver color is beautiful but doesn't look like white gold/platinum/palladium, while the stainless looks very close. Second, the stainless is much more scratch resistant, this will scratch in the first five minutes you wear it. Third, the dome on this ring is very high which was uncomfortable for me. Fourth is that the silver is likely to react with some people's skin. I like the SS ring I also bought from Sabrina much better. If you want silver, this is it, but it wasn't what I expected. <end>  Exactly what I am looking for  I choose silver bcz it won't look gaudy and noble. Being a mortal, I prefer wearing sth plain but pure and clean. I am so happy to have found this ring. It is not shining and glaring. Rather, it looks gentle and elegant with nice shape. Once feeling "blurred" from the ring surface, just simply wear it and wash your hand with regular cleasing agent and it resumes its freshness!Every friend of mine who saw this tol me that I bought the right thing and it fits me perfectly! <end>  cherylg.

 B00067WMUI  Garnet Silver Cluster Earrings ||	  Garnet Earrings......  These earrings are beautiful. The Garnet's really sparkle and they can be used to dress up or dress down with jeans.I am very happy with this purchase...it came packaged well and very fast. I would suggest that you get those disc backs for these earrings because they are large (not heavy) and they sit better on your ear than the backs that come with the earrings. <end>

 B000693X1I  White Mother of Pearl Angel Pendant on Sterling Silver Chain ||	  White Mother of Pearl Angel Pendant on Sterling Silver Chain  It was nice and in good shape. Not as large as I felt it should have been according to the picture advertised. The chain was a very thin and I would say cheapened the product. The delivery was prompt and I suppose I got what I paid for. <end>
 B000694VDW  Amazon.com  Clava Tuscan Leather Open Padfolio  Electronics ||	  Careless Packing Alert  This was not an Amazon-shipped product.The reason for the 1 star is that I never received the product.The vendor to which I was referred by Amazon did not pack the correct item and, accordingly, the item received was not the item ordered.When the vendor was contacted after receiving the item, the product was no longer available and the vendor did not volunteer to back order the product.To the vendor's credit, however, the item was able to be returned at no cost to me and my account was credited back for the purchase. <end>
 B00069FVY0  Extra Large (XL) Size 14k Gold Endless 2" (50mm diameter) Hoop Earrings, Eternal 2mm thick 2x50mm Wire Loop ||	  flimsy  Although I liked the size of these earrings, they were very thin and the closure was not secure. With my long hair, it wouldn't have taken much to have lost one or both and not known it. Certainly not worth the money. <end>
 B0006A03BK  Black Necklace Set incl. Bracelet and Earrings ||	  Excellent quality for the price  I ordered this product (which comes from China) and it was at my door in California in 2 days. I got what I ordered. Can't ask for much more for the price. <end>
 B0006A1OM2  AA White Pearl Necklace 18 inch ||	  A lovely pearl necklace.  My ex-boyfriend gave me this as a Valentine's Day present last year. While he turned out to be quite a rat scallion, the necklace he got me is flat out beautiful. I didn't know how much the necklace was until I just looked on here. For that price, I cannot believe how flawless and pretty this is. Listen up, fellas... Valentine's Day is right around the corner and giving your boyfriend a pearl necklace will show him just how much you care. A very, very thoughtful gift! <end>
 B0006A66KC  Sterling Silver 8 mm Wedding Band Christian Fish Spinner Ring oxidized background 5/16 inch wide, ||	  Beautiful ring, excellent vendor  I purchased this ring along with three others from Sabrina Silver. Everything arrived very quickly (about three days after order). All four rings were ordered the same size but two were a little small. The exchange process went very smoothly. I have read other positive reviews about this vendor and I agree. Definitely a recommended vendor.Of the four rings I got this one is my favorite. It is nice and wide but doesn't feel heavy. I use it as a thumb ring and like wider rings for my thumb. I have fidgety hands so I like the spinner ring feature. I spin it with the fingers on the hand it is worn on as well as grabbing and spinning with my other hand. With other rings I find myself pulling the ring on and off. The only reason I gave this ring 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the seam in the spinner part. One fish is cut in half at the seam. On other rings I have the design is scaled to the ring. Since this is a hand made ring I am sure there is nothing that can be done about it but it still keeps the ring from being "perfect". <end>  are you an anxious Christian?  I just recieved this BEAUTIFUL ring in the mail. To my dismay, I ordered a size 13, thinking it would be great for my thumb. Sabrina Silver suggests that you get your finger sized at a jeweler, now I see why. I can wear this ring as a necklace!!!! I took advantage of Sabrina's one-time-only exchange policy and have re-packaged this prize for downsizing to a 9, (first finger or thumb). I am all atwitter with ANTICIPATION OF RECIEVING THIS GORGEOUS RING, in the correct size. I don't remember when I was so disappointed! This ring is very well made, sturdy, polished...well just wonderful. Reminds me of my Maker. Sincerely, Cathy <end>
 B0006A66PM  Sterling Silver 8 mm Wedding Band Christian Fish Spinner Ring 5/16 inch wide Hand made , ||	  Jesus Ring  This is a beautiful high quality silver ring. I couldn't help smiling as I opened the box and saw it for the first time. I have been wearing it for several months now and continue to be very pleased with it. It is very substantial, not thin, making it an excellent man's ring. However it is very suitable for a woman (such as this reviewer) as well, being a nice alternative to rings with gemstones. I also like the spinner - moving band in the center - it gives me something to do to calm my anxieties other than nail-biting or other unhealthy habits. <end>  Excellent  Very nice ring. I paid over $50 for this ring that is now $26. The ring is very durable and easy to clean. The quality is superior and I have received compliments on it. There were some minor imperfections on my ring where the inner circlet joins but overall I am pleased and would buy this ring again ... preferably at the $26 rate. The ring is a little thick, heavy, and sometimes has a jingle sound due to the inner Jesus circlet. This is definitely a good buy! <end>
 B0006A679W  Sterling Silver 5/16 inch wide 8 mm Flat Band Spinner Ring ||	  Not what it seems  This looks like a nice ring in the picture on the site, but in reality it's really rough. I returned it for my money back because I was really disappointed in the quality of the ring. For sixty dollars i was expecting something really nicely fabricated, but the outside piece didn't spin properly (at a certain point i had to force it to spin), the saldering at the seam was awful and obvious, and there were notches and imperfections all over it. Just really disappointingly poor quality. Don't trust the picture. <end>  sterling silver 5/16" flat band spinner ring size 7  I loved this ring as soon as I saw it! The spinner part spins perfectly and the craftsmanship is beautiful.No flaws that I can see or feel. Solid feel to it. Definitely a bargain for the price. Would recommend the products from Sabrina. <end>
 B0006AAOVE  Purple Racing Maddog Stripe Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  It's ok  Basically, you get what you pay for. Nothing special but nothing horrible. I like the design better in picture then in person <end>
 B0006AAP0Y  Blue Illusion Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Love it!  I love the color of this tongue ring and I also like that the ball is not painted (which is pretty hard to find now a days) it's a see through color. <end>
 B0006ABS3W  Musical Movements - Plays "Silent Night" (Set of 2) ||	  too fast  music box plays the song just fine, but the tempo is about twice as fast as it should be, makes the song kind of difficult to recognize if you dont know what it is beforehand. I suppose im being hard on it considering its just a cheaply made toy, but its just bothersome. If you want a quality music box try something else, possibly something a little pricier. <end>
 B0006ABSL4  Silver Forest Red Filigree Drop Earrings ||	  Beautiful  They look as if they would be heavy, but are not. The color is great...red jade! Who knew! <end>  Red Silver Forest Earrings  Love them, love them, love them! Love Silver Forest earrings. They were even better than pictured. Can dress up or down for any occasion. <end>  different earrings  I bought several pair from this company and am very happy with them. Wish they would have included the little back stoppers but I just use some from another pair. If you don't use the stoppers they easly slide off if caught in sweater or?? <end>
 B0006B07NS  Sterling Silver 3/8 inch wide 10 mm Hammered Band Design Spinner Ring ||	  Great ring & Great Service  The rings were just as advertised and delivered quickly.We love them.It does takes a few days to 'break them in' so they spin easily. <end>
 B0006DN800  Silver Celtic Brigits Sun Charm Amulet Pendant Necklace ||	  Upset  I was really sad to hear that after only one week after i gave these pendent to a friend she called me and let me know that the pendent had broke. I couldn't believe it. <end>
 B0006DQP9Q  Pugster License Plate Vermont Flag Italian Charm Bracelet Bracelet Link ||	  green mountains  I wasn't prepared for the fact that this is a double-length charm. It makes the bracelet fit differently on my wrist since I added it. But the detail is very clear, even the "green mountain state" part at the bottom of the license plate. <end>
 B0006FM16A  Contek New & Improved Ultrasonic Jewelry Cleaner ||	  Good Cleaner for the Price!!  I have found this to be a very useful cleaner for eye glasses, jewelry and other small items. The plastic part, used to place a metal watch band in the cleaning solution, while keeping the movement out of the tank, is a nice addition.I add a bit of dish detergent to hot water and get very good results.No, it is not an engine block cleaner but it is well designed and is of high quality. I rate it 5 stars because it does what it was designed to do ------ ie  clean small parts at a low cost.PS  October 6, 2005 --- this item is no longer available but seems to be similar to the HAIER HU 335 W. However, I have noticed that there are other units available with a little more power ie  65 watts versus 35 watts. I would have gone that route had I known at the time. <end>  Crappy cleaner  Bought this for my mom as a present. It worked fine for about 4 uses, then broke. I'm a mechanical engineer and have used industrial ultrasonic cleaners before, so I took it apart to see if I could repair it. I then saw how poorly made this product is. Unfortunately, if you want a good quality ultrasonic cleaner, you have to spend at least a few hundred dollars. <end>  Chris  This had to be the worst merchandise anyone could possible think of spending money on. I would recomend buying any other cleaner before ever thinking of concord technology again. <end>
 B0006G0P76  Tommaso Design(tm) Genuine Sapphire and Diamond Ring LIFETIME WARRANTY ||	  High quailty, well-made interesting design  I was looking for a sapphire ring for my wife; it had to be unusual, yet not overly pricey.

I WILL be buying from them again! <end>
 B0006GCE34  Gothic Forbidden Magic Key of Solomon Pendant Necklace ||	  Very nice!  This is a very nice piece... I've been looking for a key pendant for a while now... But all the ones I've seen have been very feminine. And this one, while slightly satanic... Fits nicely to the meaning I wanted, without making me feel like a fairy princess.Shipping even got here early...!My only problem with it is having to pull out the pliers to get it to fit on a different neck piece from the same seller. 4/5! <end>  Great  I was very pleased with this necklace. It was a little smaller than I expected but actually it's better that way. Other than that, it looks exactly like it's supposed to. It arrived on time and my girlfriend loved it. <end>  Forbidden Magic Key  Quite expensive for the quality and craftsmanship of the necklace. Immediately had the fob break but was easily fixed. I like the necklace but wish I had gotten what I paid for. <end>  Nice after care  I really love this pendant; though i really wish it was little stronger metal. I decided to put clear protective nail polish on the key, let it dry but not completely, then sat at the sink of running hot water for 20 minutes scrubbing with dish soap and rinsed it. The pendant is much shiner now and i like it better than from when i first bought it. (The nail polish protectent coat removes the 'black' from it) <end>  it is not sterling silver  this necklace is not sterling silver i cant find 925 on it ne where it feels like something that came from a bubble gum machine the key bends easily and will soon just break its more like plastic than silver it was a good fraud for 30 bucks u got me once u will not do it again!!!!!!!!!amanda payne <end>  Attractive, but not functional.  The key is designed wonderfully, but, sadly, its construction doesn't hold up so well... very prone to bending and (eventually) breaking. I'll be looking for a sturdier replacement. <end>  Poor  I received the key in great time but it was very small and not very sturdy as the picture may make it seem. The key is very weak between the pentical and the diamond shape in the middle. do not recommend to anyone buying this for a everyday wear or anything of the sort. The chain is also very small. <end>  Awesome pendant!  Wow, I love this pendant. Perfect size. Even though it comes with a strong chain, I did put it on a 14k yellow chain just to hilight the goldtones of the pentagram. Gotten lots of compliments. Comfortable and fun to wear. Quick shipping. Very happy! <end>  Poor  it looks big and strong in a picture but Unfortunately, after few weeks from buying it became broken <end>
 B0006GCE4I  Silver Dragon Star Pentacle Dragonstar Pendant Necklace ||	  beautiful piece  fast delivery and good customer service are also contributing to the product rating. The pendant itself is awesome and... delicate. The later being the reason for giving the jewelry only 4 stars. It's TOO delicate. The dragon's wings can (and did) break easily simply by getting stuck in your clothing. Still, a beautiful piece (I just hope I'll find someone to patch it up, so that I can wear it again). <end>  A Delighted Customer  I am so delighted with this product! It's even more beautiful than the picture displayed! Very fast delivery. I will be ordering again in the near future. <end>  dragon star pendant necklace  I purchased the necklace for my 14 year old son and he just loves it. The online picture of it does not allow you to see all the detail. I was more pleased then I thought I would be. As always I am very happy with amazon. Thanks <end>  An awesome gift for any dragon lover  This is really a snazzy piece of jewelry, well-crafted and very unique in design, perfect for the occultist or goth rocker. Personally, I'm a huge fan of dragon art and this fine necklace is the perfect homage in that regard. <end>  LOVE this thing  Dragon necklaces are one of my most favorite things in the world, and this one is certainly no exception. This pendant is simply beautiful. I wear it as often as I can. I COULD see the wings breaking off if one were to do something stupid while wearing it, but I wear this when I drum, run parkour, and hangout with my friends and it hasent broken yet. Hopefully never will. Great product. <end>  Elegant and unique  As some1 said it a great gift for a goth rocker, occultist or a dragon lover.It is a very special and unique piece of jewlery and it is just no words that can describe how cool it is. There alot more to this piece then what can be seen online. I just love it, I used towear it evryday until it broke, so I would recomend a little care and caution. But dont expect to much of pewter, it is just 95%tin and 5% silver so not solid titanium, but you get the point!Great piece of jewlrey for any1 who likes dragons/pentagrams. <end>

 B0006HAFFC  Sterling Silver 10 Inch X 4.5 mm Curb Chain Anklet - JewelryWeb ||	  Pretty but not true to size  I purchased this ankle bracelet as a gift for a friend. It was supposed to be a 10" chain, but much to her embarassment when she opened it and tried to put it on, it didn't even fit around her ankle. I ended up giving it to someone else.Since then, I have ordered another - hoping it was an error by the shipper. The chain is so nice, I'm willing to give it another try - for the same friend's birthday. How embarrassing will it be if they send the wrong size, again! <end>

 B0006HB49I  Nickel Free Italian Silver 5mm Figaro Link Chain Necklace ||	  iffy seller  I'm giving 3 stars because I like the chain I received enough to keep. The seller loses 2 stars for bad customer service and inaccurate product description. I have received no communication from the seller - no order confirmation/shipping email and no response to my email. The chain I received was just under 4MM, not the 5MM described. I emailed the seller several days ago to ask if I received the wrong item - no response. <end>  Nice, but not what I ordered  The chain that arrived was lovely, but it was not the type that was ordered. And, I'm not taking the time to return it. Just won't order from here again. <end>  Great seller!  Wonderful necklace, great price and value. Very recommended! This is my third purchase, I have never been disappointed. <end>
 B0006HB4W0  Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver Cuban Link 4mm wide Chain Necklace ||	  Christmas Present  We purchased the Chain for our son for Christmas. It was a hit with him! He hasn't taken it off since Christmas morning. The chain is very well made and looks great. <end>  Chain Review  The chain I ordered was sent promply. It was great! The chain is on me 24/7 since it holds an Italian luck horn I wear. The chain looks great, and it has a good clasp. Perfect for holding my charm since I did not want to invest in white gold. <end>  Great chain!  This chain came very quickly and is of a very nice quality and craftsmanship. It was a bit long and too thin for my taste though. Thankfully Gem Avenue has a great return policy and was very understanding. I would myself and highly recommend this vendor to anyone looking for a nice piece of jewelry <end>  Italian 30 inch Cuban link chain necklace  The 30 inch necklace was very delightful and of very high quality, the only thing is that I wished the lobster claw was a little larger in order to make locking the clasp a little easier. I am pleased with this product. What I was not pleased about was that when I came home from work, FedEx chose to leave the package partially under my door mat, which I thought could have been fodder for someone to steal it. <end>  good quality  good quality, although i was sent the wrong item. the quility of the other necklace I received is good. Im keeping it anyway. <end>  Beautiful & Shinny  Beautiful and highly shinny necklace; prompt delivery  took only 4 days to receive merchandise through standard shipping. A little desappointed with the package it came in. For a piece of silver jewelry, I would expect a little more sophisticated case." <end>  Love It  This item is very nice i ordered the 30 Inch and it came out just as i expected and it is new and shiny. <end>  beautiful necklace  I bought two of these for my husband and I, and we love them. We never take them off! Thank you so much <end>  Great for the price  It was very nice. Did not think it would look so nice on my husband's neck. <end>  Excelente cadena  Hola, no hablo ingles nada, solo espa&ntilde;ol, bueno de mas esta decir que todo fue excelente, como la entrega de la cadena como la calidad de la calidad, saludos desde veenzuela <end>  Necklace  The necklace is beautiful and brilliant. The size is flattering... not too bulky or dainty looking. Received quickly as well. <end>  because of the "5 stars" review  I had the charm, but no necklace. I read all the reviews. Because of the reviews I purchased the necklace. I am extremely happy with the necklace, my boyfriend loves it and it was a perfect match to the charm. It was worth the money spent and I plan on getting three more for my daughters. <end>  Very brilliant neckace  I bought this chain to go with a crucifix that I had. The necklace was shipped promptly and was well packaged. The diamond cut on it is very nice and really shines. The necklace is very well put together and had no flaws what-so-ever. <end>  [ERFECT CHAIN  Love these chains. So perfect with almost any pendant, jewel, or even to just wear alone! <end>  Excellent Quality  I purchased this as a gift and was a little worried what it might look like... I was really surprised at the quality. The picture does not really show the quality or the detail. The finish was excellent. Would highly recommend this chain. Gem Avenue was great to deal with. Very prompt shipping. <end>  Great Necklace  I had been looking for this type of necklace for a few months now. With a store that I won't name, I had to send back a necklace I bought 3 times because they couldn't get it right. I began searching for a necklace like this but could not find it. Finally, I found this necklace on Amazon and ordered it. It came way sooner than I expected (which is always a good thing) and felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I opened the package and liked what I saw. I wear it everywhere I go and I am glad that I bought this necklace. I would definitely recommend buying this necklace. <end>  4mm 30" cuban link s. silver  I purchased this 4mm 30" while looking for a nice necklace to put a pendant on.I do like the size, it feels nice, but I would like one a bit thicker. But price-wise, the 4mm was what I went with. So as a male, this is a decent fit, and the length isn't too much. <end>  Beautiful necklace  I bought this necklace for my husband. I wasn't sure if the links were big enough and if the necklace was as bright looking as in the picture. The link size is just right - the 4 MM is just big enough to look like a man's necklace. The silver is very bright, no dullness at all, and very comfortable. My husband wears this necklace all the time. It's a good price for a high quality necklace. I would recommend this necklace to any woman who wants to buy a nice silver necklace for her boyfriend, husband or significant other. <end>  Sterling Silver Cuban Link 24" chain  The product is of great value. The product more than met my expectations. This company is very reliable and shipped when promised. <end>  Great product!  The Sterling Silver Curb Cuban Link 4mm Italian 18" neckless is very attractive and well made. I will definitely order more from Gem. Service was great and the product was received when promised and in good condition. Definitely a five star company. <end>  hthe chain this perfect one, envio was perfect and is but of wich it hopes!!!  the chain this perfect one, envio was perfect and is but of wich it hopes!!! <end>  Sturdy, elegant silver chain  The picture on this product really doesn't do it justice. The chain is sturdy, has a nice weight to it and it's more elegant than boxy. The silver is very bright. If I were writing ad copy I'd say this chain was the perfect combination of masculinity and style.My husband was wanting a chain he could hang his wedding ring on while he was working and not worry about chain breaking/losing the ring. He also didn't want a chain he would have to fuss with if it didn't lay flat. We've both seen chains when a lot of wear "kinks the links". It was a tall order but the moment I saw this chain I thought it might be the one. When I received it, I realized I'd made a good choice.Husband really loved it when he opened it. He wears it all the time - even showering with it on - and it's holding up perfectly.I was very, very pleased with the quality of this product, the price, quick turnaround on shipping and packaged nicely (in a small jewel box but also in a ziploc pouch in the box).Based on my experience I would definitely recommend this vendor in general and definitely this product in particular. <end>  Perfect...  I bought this chain with a little fear that I might not like it, but really it's perfect. THe only flaw is that it's too short for me, but I'm not going to substract a star because obviously it was my fault because I didn't imagine the length right.Overall...see it, buy it... <end>  Nice Chain!  I'm very happy with this chain. Great quality, nice and heavy, good, fluid movement and feels nice against the skin. Solid clasp! It's a really well-made, pretty piece.Would also like to note that this seller, Gem Avenue, was fast, fair, and friendly. Nice seller, nice product...I'll look for this one again! <end>  I love it!  I bought this chain for my boyfriend for Christmas, and it looks GREAT on him. I was afraid it might be too short, but it is the perfect length and the color is beautiful! My boyfriend loves it, and hasn't taken it off since I gave it to him. <end>  Great service and a great product.  I wanted a nice necklace to go with my usual weekend gear for some more flash. I saw this and liked it alot. The seller was fast and it was shipped to my house only days later.The chain looks great. They gave me the right size and I will feel confident wearing it. Would definitely recommend them and this product to anyone else. <end>  Beautiful Chain, Great little gift for anyone!  I bought this chain to replace one of my wife's broken chain. I gave it to her as a small gift around the holiday season. When my wife opened it and tried it on, I was very surprise by the quality. She absolutely loves it and wears it everyday. She was going to use the charm from her previous chain but just left it alone by itself. I am very happy with this little chain and so is my wife. I would recommend it to anyone. You'll be very please with it. <end>  Just one word  Lovely  I got the 24" and wow its lovely... the chain itself looks great, i used it for a day and i have received many complements specially from girls ^.^... dont knwo what else to say and the price was right on the spot... the seller makes business in a very professional way and im lookin forward to buy another piece of jewerly from them... go for it!! <end>  Welll worth the price  Got the 24 in, and its has nice wt for a 4 mm, and fits my star of david pendant perfectly.I shower in mine, so I have had no problem with the clasp breaking as some say happens. Its jewelry, you got to treat it gentle. Just what I was looking for. Would buy again. <end>  A pleasant surprise  This is a truly beautiful silver necklace. The links are heavy and have an exceptionally lovely design. The silver is bright and showy. I think this is a bargain at the price paid. Of the several birthday gifts I bought for my wife, some quite a bit more expensive, this is her favorite. <end>  NICE PIECE - BUT ............  Beautiful chain, but the clasp broke after two days. We returned the chain and are awaiting for it to be fixed or a new chain in its place. <end>
 B0006HDGZS  North Dakota Lapel Pin ||	  Good enough, for government work . . .  This is a serviceable little pin. I bought it for my legion hat, to put with an assortment of other small pins and am pretty unimpressed. It will do; I certainly don't want to buy another, but . . . it is very blurry and the backing isn't great. <end>
 B0006HFQ3I  Truly Terrific Tribal Nipple Shield ||	  nipple enhancement  A really nice comfortable enhancement to the nipples. Can be worn indefinitely, unlike some other nipple shields with holes too small for large nipples, although if you can lubricate them and pull them through there is a stimulating effect. The effect is especially striking over brightly tattooed nipples. <end>
 B0006HR316  Shooting Star Japanese Akoya Cultured Pearl Earring ||	  Nice Item  VERY Poor Customer Service  As an internet based jewlery business, American Pearl has a 30 day return policy. This is necessary due to the fact that you cannot see or feel the jewlery in person and you are buying based on photos.I ordered the Shooting Star earrings and they arrived in about a week later. Unfortunately my fiancee didn't care for them. I returned the earrings for an exchange (10 day turnaround to ship back, process, and recieve the new item and received the second pair). Again she did not care for them.I then started the return process. You need to get an authorization number to retun the item. Unfortunately they are only available between 9am and 5pm M-F, which due to a busy work schedule, took me a few days to reach them for a RA#. I shipped the item back and waited for the refund to hit my credit card.The entire purchase/exchange/return took 33 days. Instead of a refund I received a store credit. I called an explained that an exchange took place on the original item and should therefore extend the 30-day policy so that we could have time to recieve and assess the second pair of earrings. They stated store policy was 30 days regardless of the number of exchanges.This is not appropriate -- nor explained anywhere on thier website. It was also not explained during any of the phone conversations that occurred.Buyer beware... <end>
 B0006I73B0  Cubic-zirconia Rhodium Finish Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Very pretty, a little big  With the low price of this ring, I knew I was taking a gamble. But, much to my surprise it looked better in person. Nice, not an overly costume piece. Too bad it seems to run a half size bigger than the true ring sie. I have small fingers to start with though, so it is hard to find a good fit. I gave it to my mom-in-las and she loved it. <end>
 B0006IC09K  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Puzzle Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  Very impressed!  I bought a celtic puzzle ring from Silver Insanity through Amazon, and I was very impressed with what I received. Not only was my ring shipped to me in a timely manner, but I was also impressed with how quickly they answered the questions I had! I am sure I will be visiting Silver Insanity again soon.  ) <end>  Lacking instructions  I love this ring except for the fact when I received it the receipt that came with it which had a link for a website to the instructions, the link was incorrect. I also tried to e-mail the contact e-mail multiple times with no response. The instructions below which someone so graciously posted are correct, agreed are very cryptic and are difficult to interpret, but I would still be trying to put it back together without them. The first time I tried to put it back together it took me upwards of 2 hours to interpret the instructions and get it together. Once you figure it out its not that bad. The grooves that they talk about are located on the INSIDE of the bands. Good luck! <end>  Beautiful but frustrating  I thought this ring was beautiful, so my husband bought it for me. It came in a gold box without any instructions. I pulled the tag off and the little piece of twine and ended up with a three day mess. We read directions and watched video. Finally, my husband's uncle, Bobby Attaway, put it back together. I am having it sodered asap. I don't need jewelry puzzles to keep me occupied. I am a youth minister's wife, I have a six year old, and I teach middle school. I have enough puzzles a day. My jewelry should be attractive and simple. I do love my ring. <end>  Great Purchase!  I love this ring- It's so cool and I love it's uniqueness. It can be tricky to put together, but once you get the hang of it, it is possible. Plus, it's fun to try to figure it out (it makes it all the more exciting when you finally do get it together!) I would definitely reccomend, if you have some time/patience to learn how to reassemble it. <end>  fun puzzle ring  this ring is just about what i expected. it's fun and puzzling, and it looks nice. i figured it out after about 20 minutes of messing with it(i've always been good with puzzles, so it might take someone else longer). <end>  ring  Ring came quickly, nice condition. Extremely important to keep together, very hard puzzle to put back together and no solution comes with the ring. Ring solutions can be found on line by googling but have to try several to find one that works for particular ring. <end>  Great fun but needed solution  This is a fun item to own, I spent 2 days trying to get it solid again and had to look up the solutionon the internet. I think a solution should be included with the item. <end>  Don't take the string off!  I am very disappointed with this ring. It is very pretty, but once you take the string off it falls apart and there are no instructions to put it back together. My husband and I have been trying to put it back together based on the picture of the ring on this website and have had NO luck. Now all I have is a pile of silver rings that I cannot wear. If anyone knows how to put this back together, please post how! Thanks. <end>  Puzzle Popped Apart  Loved it when it arrived. Very pretty, size fit perfectly. But the first time I took it off and plunked it down on the ring stand it popped apart. Never to be reassembled. I've had friends and family all try to put it back together. Very sad. <end>  Wonderful Ring  This ring was more than I expected! It is a wonderful piece. I have won it everyday since I got it and have had many compliments on it. People love trying to figure out how to put it back together. The photo's are great but it looks better once you slip it on. A great product. <end>  you tube solution is way easier!!!!!  Youtube the solution!!!!!! there is a video that is less then 1 minute long and very simple. I spent 2 hours trying to solve the ring with the instructions in the first review..... I solved it on my first try after watching the youtube video. <end>  Beautiful!!  This is an absolutely beautiful ring. Pic doesnt do it justice. Arrived quickly. Will be interested to see how it holds up. Happy with purchase. <end>  Beautiful  I have never seen such a nice design 4 band puzzle ring as this. However, when u disassembled it, the interior was not polished at all ( dull grey). Overall, It was a nice design and I have fun putting it back! Solutions can be easily found on youtube video. Slightly thick band for slim fingers like mine but it will suit nicely on third finger or larger finger. <end>  I love my puzzle ring  This ring is very pretty and not bulky. I love it. I am going to buy more for gifts. <end>  Pretty but a pain in the butt  I love this ring, but bought it without realizing it's a puzzle. I had to get my boyfriend (who loves puzzles) to put it together for me, then he used a hot glue gun to keep it together, temporarily. I suppose it's not the company's fault, I just wish I'd read the reviews of it before I purchased it, instead of after. Just be aware that this ring comes apart and will do so every time you take it off. <end>  cool, but once it's apart...  This was a gift and is a lovely ring. Without thinking, I cut the thread holding it together, but managed to get another on there before it came apart. That thread lasted about two months, and now it is apart in my jewelry box, waiting for me to try the solution another reviewer posted. I hope it works! <end>  My daughter loves this ring  This is a very beautiful "puzzle ring." My daughter wears it all the time, and her brothers also enjoy solving the puzzle. Worth the price. Very nice item. Recommended. <end>  Puzzle Ring  Easy to complete - follow you tube videos available for puzzle rings and you'll solve in no time. <end>  Beautiful on outside...  The ring is very pretty when you get it. However, being curious, I of course took it apart. Therefore, it stands to reason, with no directions I wasn't able to put it back together for the rest of the night. However, when I tried the next day by holding the outside frame of the ring, I did accomplish it without directions. It is very tricky though.The one negative is that when you take it apart, the inside is not very pretty. The outside is silver, but the inside is unfinished and dull. I just think it makes that look a little cheap, although you can only tell when you take it apart.Mine also does not simply fall apart, but it is loose -- but that makes sense because the ring is meant to come apart! <end>  Cool ring  I love this ring. It took me a while to figure out how to solve the puzzle once undone (it becomes addictive). Totally recommend it to all my friends. I also love the design <end>  Ring's Ok, service is crummy  The ring itself was pretty and sturdy, but beware what size you order because despite using a sizing chart, the actual puzzle rings never come in the right size. I wasted a lot of time and money trying to get the right size because the customer service was really slow and unhelpful. Unlike some better puzzle ring websites I've seen, this one didn't offer any guides or suggestions for choosing the correct ring size. <end>  Lovely ring  Certainly a nice ring, looks more complex than it really is. I had a wonderful time putting it back together, especially when I'm showing off. My first puzzle ring, and will probably be the first of many. Overall, a nice ring for a nice price. <end>  DO NOT take the string off the ring!!!  This ring is absolutely gorgeous and I havent taken it off since recieving it. But when buying this ring, be careful not to take the string off of the bands. This string protects you from well....insanity. I unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands. Luckily I found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it. My dad put it back together and it was fine, but I have to admit I'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off. If this does happen to you, google "puzzle ring solutions" and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal. <end>  Should of come with instructions  My husband, neighbor and myself spent the entire night trying to solve the puzzle and couldn't and tarnished what was a beautiful ring when it arrived. We cannot solve the puzzle so it was a waste of money. <end>  it sucked  it tarnished on the first day and broke on the third day. It is in the trash where it belongs <end>  Not Worth It  I bought three of these rings for my sisters and I, and only one of them is in tact! I have only had these for three days. They fall apart really easily and are impossible to put back together. Save your money and your sanity... if puzzle is in the title its probably not a good idea. <end>  Beautiful ring (and solution)!  I love this ring! It's interesting to look at, and I like the design. I haven't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle. Maybe one day I might try it, but I like it so much I don't want to chance it now. Shipped fast.9/26/07 - update SOLUTIONThe following is a step by step solution for a thin band, four link puzzle ringSterling Silver Celtic Knot Puzzle Band Ring (Size 5,6,7,8,9,10). I e-mailed Silver Insanity and asked for the solution to this particular ring, and this is what I received. I did not edit any of the information sent. It's a bit wordy, but it works. I hope this helps everyone.1. You will notice that the four bands are similar, but upon closer inspection there are slight differences. Two of the links have a simple peak to them, and the other two links have a dip and a peak. Look carefully to identify each link. At this time, single out the link that has a simple peak, with 4 etches carved into it. (The etches may be faint, compare the two simple peak links and choose the one with more grooves)2. Once you have found the simple peaked link with four grooves, hold that link only, letting the other links dangle. Turn the ring so that the top of the peak is pointing away from you. There should be two links dangling from the link you are holding, with the fourth link dangling from those two links.3. While still holding the four grooved link, take the other simple peaked link, which should be the one dangling from the bottom, and bring it up to meet with the one you are holding. You should now be holding the two links together, the bands of the links together, and the points of the peaks pointing outwards, opposite of each other (It should look like a diamond)4. Continue holding the links together with your thumb and pointer finger (you will need your other fingers for the next part).5. You will notice that you now have the two 'dip and peak' links dangling from the two links you are holding. Select the link on the right---this is trial and error, sometimes the correct link will be on the right already, and sometimes you may have to pass the wrong link over the top of the ring in order to place the correct link in the proper position. The two dangling links are very hard to tell apart, so you will discover which is the correct one for the next step by following these instructions  6. After grabbing the dangling link on the right, turn the link so that the peaks and dips face you. Looking at the link, notice the dips and peaks. You want the link that has peaks that point like arrows to the LEFT, then the right. (The other link has peaks that point like arrows to the RIGHT, then left )7. When you have found the correct link for the next step, hold it taut against the two simple peak bands you have been holding between your thumb and forefinger. The band of those two links should now be resting against the LEFT pointing peak of the selected link, and you should adjust your hands so that you are holding that link on your pinky, taut.8. With your free hand, grab the last remaining link. Turn the link so that the peaks and dips face the top of the ring (you should be holding the ring upright the entire time) Bring the remaining link towards the right, and overlap it with the link you're holding on your pinky. The easiest way to do this is to imagine you are trying to put the other link on your pinky with the one that's already there. If this is done correctly, you will still be holding the two simple peak links between your thumb and forefinger, and they will form a diamond shape. You will also be holding the other two links on your pinky, they should form a figure eight, with the other two bands passing through the center.9. At this point, I usually change the position of my hands. Now ,hold the figure eight together with your thumb and middle finger, trying not to disrupt the other ones too much! Try to maintain the diamond shape in some way, hold it however you are comfortable, in a way that will enable you to continue with these instructions.10. Select the link on the top, closest to you. (part of the diamond) Spin the link around so that the peak fits through the figure eight---also, make sure that once the peak is inside the figure eight it also passes through the band of the other part of the 'diamond' . When the link has been spun, and passed through the figure eight and the band of the remaining link, fold it downwards, so that it is flush with the two links that form a figure eight.11. Well, you made it to the last remaining link...congratulations!All you have to do now is carefully spin the last link so the peak fits between the peaks and gaps of the already mostly assembled ring (just spin it, no need to do anything fancy! ) Once the last remaining link has been passed through the ring, fold it down to lay flush with the rest of the links.12. Enjoy your puzzle ring! <end>  dude..it's a PUZZLE ring.  For those of you having difficulty with the ring..I think you forgot it's supposed to be a PUZZLE.if it were easy, what fun would that be!- great ring, I love it..it was a fun challenge  ) <end>  Awesome  This ring is gorgeous and incredibly frustrating until you finally figure it out. Another reviewer left written instructions for how to solve the puzzle, but I found those to be impossible to follow. So once I got it I decided to make a video for anyone too frustrated with the ring. It is available on youtube ... [...] <end>  Surprisingly Shiny  I was surprised at how shiny and beautiful it is in real life. I couldn't contain myself...the same day I got it, I snipped the string holding it together. I spent the next 3 1/2 hours attempting to put it together. Near one in the morning, exhausted, eye-strained, and slightly hysterical the dang thing fell together. (I'm not sure I can put it together again) Needless to say I wrapped a new string around it, but wear it daily. It really is a beautiful ring. I'm contemplating the purchase of another puzzle type ring. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is my fave ring of all time. It comes with a string around it so it won't fall a part when you take it out of the box. Although, mine has to be "taken" apart. It doesn't just fall apart like some of the looser knots do.I love this ring & the company has a video you can watch & learn to how to put it, & other puzzle rings, back together. The indviual bands are thin & can bend so you have to be nice it, but it is well worth the money. <end>  Love my Ring  I love the design of the ring. I wear my ring practically everyday. When the puzzle ring came apart I did have some difficulty getting it back together. I emailed the seller and within a day they emailed me the instrustions with pictures. I'm sure all of you who've spent hours trying to put your ring together feel pretty silly now. Now that I know how to get my ring back together it takes only a few minutes. I would recommend this item to anyone... just remember to email and get the instructions. <end>  FRUSTRATING  Now we see why the maker is called Silver Insanity. We bought the ring and it came today - it was beautiful. I took the rope binding the ring off and it came apart nearly instantly. We have been working on putting it back together for 3 hours. There is no answer key with the ring, and apparently no key on the web. The maker will not take it back if it has been separated. So if anyone knows how to put the dang thing back together, please email dunnhorn@yahoo.com <end>  Great Gift Product  Well made, sturdy, not like some of these flimsy puzzel rings that break, looks even better on the finger than in the photo. <end>  Beautiful ring  The ring looks exactly like the picture shown, and after a brief cleaning it fit together easily. The one sent to me was easily a size larger than I had ordered however - perhaps it was a fluke. I'm still going to keep it though.  ) <end>  Birthday Present ~ Love it!  I read the reviews and I understand how this ring can be frustrating, but I absolutely love it. This was my second puzzle ring so I already knew how to put it together. Once you take the time to learn it is a fantastic conversation piece, and very pretty. <end>
 B0006ICPMC  Classic Claddagh Ring Size 8 ||	  Excellent  This is a great item cheap but looks great, my girlfriend loves it, she hardly ever takes it off, it was a great buy. <end>
 B0006ICPTU  Claddagh Wave Ring Size 14 ||	  Stunning ring!  This is a wonderfully crafted ring. Sterling Silver, 6.60 millimeters with, and has a very comfortable design. Very impression on the hand. Generally rings this heavy are bulky feeling, but the wave of the edges really cause you not to notice this read. Has the Claddagh symbols inside Celtic knot work, blending the more modern interpretation with tradition designs.It a stunning, beautiful ring that one would expect to pay four times the price. <end>  Wonderful Product and Service!!!  I ordered the Claddagh Wave ring for my wife and it is absolutly wonderful. THe ordering process was easy and the shipping was quick. So quick in fact it was recieved a day earlier than promised. Thanks!!! <end>
 B0006IHS4C  Blue Crystal Pentagram Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Beautiful Celtic pentacle necklace  As someone with an allergy to contact silver, I am always searching for jewelry that does not have silver, which tends to be the dominant metal of choice. I was pleased when I ran across the jewelry at Dan's b/c it was pewter, which does not cause my skin to react allergically.The piece looks beautiful on the page, but the pictures honestly do not do it justice. It is small light-weight, well crafted piece, with a beautiful inset stone.There is also sufficient clearance space to use different kinds of necklace chain's. Unfortunately the black-twine necklace length enclosed with the piece also irritates my skin, but it was inexpensive for me to provide my own silk rope chain, and the large eye hole accommodated the new clasps wonderfully (Which is not always the case with some jewelry). <end>  A lovely Pentagram / Pentacle  A gorgeous Pentagram with a bright blue stone. Stone is in there very well and doe not come off after wearing in shower. Much nicer than pictured. <end>  Beautiful  So, my little sister stole my nice, plain pentagram necklace last year. I bought another one. When that one became tarnished beyond belief, I knew I needed a new one. When I saw this necklace, I knew it was the one I wanted. When it arrived in the mail, it was exactly as the same as it was in the picture, only more beautiful. I am very happy with this necklace. My only complaint would be that the rope used to hold the pendent makes it flip around a lot, so I cut it and reformed it to make it like any other necklace so it won't flip around. Besides that, its perfect for me.  ) <end>  great quality and value  Second time I have ordered from this seller. I must remark how easy and efficient my experiences have been especially considering they needed to ship to Hong Kong! That was really fast as well!Both items of jewellery are gorgeous, exactly like the photo and of durable quality.I would strongly recommend Dan's jewellery 100% as great value for money! <end>  Very beautiful but not good for every day wear.  I just got this necklace today and is very pretty. The rope it comes on is very nice and you can adjust it to the size you want. The workmanship is great. The stone is just the right color and the entire necklace is not very heavy. You almost don't know it is there. I would buy it again in a heart beat. The only thing bad is that if you wear it all the time like I do the silver finish comes off and not it is starting to look ugly. <end>  Beautiful!  This Pentacle was well made and ready to wear. It arrived quickly and was a good price. I would buy from them again. <end>  Product Review.  Regardless of whether or not you see it as a pentagram or pentacle, this truly is beautiful. In my tradition, it is a pentacle. An easy way to think of it is by doing some word math. Take pentagram + circle, and you'll come up with pentacle. That's how I remember, and it avoids confusion like no other.It had been awhile since I had seen the picture of the Blue Crystal Pendant and when it came in, I was like WTF! Where are the other blue crystals? I thought maybe there were supposed to be more, and was glad to know that there weren't more put in, because to me it would appear to be a little cheesy and too blingy (if that's even a word). I'm wearing it right now, and I can't get enough of it. Definitely not a pentacle to never take off, but definitely worth the price of admission and I'd buy it again if it were lost or stolen. <end>  My new favorite necklace  I got this a few months back and I really, really, really like it. I traded out the cord for a chain I had another necklace pendant on and the swap was super easy. The hoop for the chain is plenty big to put almost any kind of chain through. The pendant itself is very heavy and durable and has not tarnished or worn out yet even though I wear it every second of every day. The jewel is bright even in low light and sparkles nicely even if it is a fake. I loved it so much I got one for my best friend as well and she likes it just as much as I do.So, in summery, cord crummy but easy to replace, pendant lovely and heavy. It's about an inch wide (about the size of a dollar coin). Jewel hasn't fallen out or anything retarded. Overall, I give a A-. <end>  Good  Frankly, I'm just glad to finally have a pentagram necklace. Sadly, it keeps flipping around (regardless of how I put it on). The knot that tied the strig to the loop is warped, and I'm afraid to fiddle with it too much (I don't want it to break). Anyways, It came quickly, is decent sized, and hopefully the warped knot is an isolated irritation. 4 out of 5. <end>  Good for price  I doubt this is real pewter. It comes on a crappy black thread cord. but it's not ugly or garishly large. i wear it alot <end>  Great!  It's wonderful and I have been wearing it everyday since I bought it. It's the perfect size, it is not too large and flashy but it's not tiny either. <end>  wunderbar!  the necklace came the same day it was supposed to. I can echo what most have been saying, its better than the photos. I have yet to encounter any snags with the black cord that comes with the necklace, in fact i actually like how it is easily adjustible! The actual pendant has not been "turning over" as somebody else has stated. All in all i would definitely purchase this product again as a perspective buyer! <end>  lovely and goes with everything  I luv this necklace it combines a celtic design as well as a tribute to my beliefs. I woulod recommend this to anyone. <end>  a little tug and the rope was broken  This piece is beautiful. but the Rope fell apart after 2 weeks. I would recommend having a backup for when it goes <end>  Very Beautiful  I love it, very glad I chose to get this! Also love the easy-to-adjust necklace that came with. My mother saw it and thought it was beautiful as well, and she hates pentagrams <end>  Yay  I just got this for Christmas and I love it. It's just as pretty as the picture and everything I imagined. Highly Recommend. <end>  Love it!  This was my first (and so far only) pentacle necklace. The picture does not do this piece justice, it is VERY beautiful. I was afraid to put it on at first because it was so perfect.The cord it comes on (the adjustable cord) is perfect, since I'm so small myself, it shrinks down to a perfect size, and can be big enough to easily fit over your head.I have removed this necklace one time over the 6 or so months I've had it, and it still looks as though I bought it yesterday. (Even through showers, hair products, and perfume, as most pieces wear down or tarnish.)I look forward to buying this piece for a few of my friends as well, and hope they cherish it as much as I have. I would definately recommend this piece to anyone looking for a pentacle, or "pentagram," whether it's for relilgious purposes, as a gift, to show it off, or even if it'll be your first one. VERY pleased with this. <end>  Awesome  I love this necklace. The only two issues I have with it is; 1) The way they tied the knot makes the pentacle constantly flip over so the backside is showing. I had to untie the knot before it was fixed and now its fine. 2) This isn't really an issue with the necklace and perhaps I should have said that earlier however the title of the necklace is wrong. This is not a pentagram. Its a pentacle which is a five pointed star contained within a circle. Pentagrams and Pentacles are two different symbols though both are often used in magick. So really the knot was the only issue. The stone in the middle of the necklace is awesome because the way the light hits it, causes it to light up which draws your eyes to the blue stone and the necklace as a whole. The detailed artwork is great too. So this necklace in summary is well worth the money and I look forward to buying more from this retailer. <end>  Beautiful  I truly love this necklace as a testament to my faith. I am a High Priest in my own Tradition, and I've been looking everywhere for a pentacle that... fit, that &#34;felt&#34; right. This is a lovely pendant and very sturdy in design. It is a decent size; a bit larger than one inch, and the cord is adjustable. <end>  Jewelry  This blue crystal penant was as described. It is a nice item for the price. I think it is best for a young adult or child. <end>  Lovely Pentagram Pendant, False "Jewel."  The pendant in and of itself is very lovely, as the picture shows. As some have said, the cord is tied a bite awkwardly, but that's an easy fix. Great detail; love the five "dots" right by the gem - as well as those around the border - to match the five points/elements. However, the gem is not as shown, at least in my case. This pendant was made to have an empty spot in the center to go with the other five; I received it with a rhinestone/sequens-like "jewel" glued into the center hole. (There was even glue smeared across it a bit.) I would pry out the jewel and just leave it be on its own but pewter is so sensitive. Other versions of this pendant are out and about that contain fake gems in the small five holes, too. So, for the lack of a real gem, the price may be a bit steep, but the details of the rest of this piece (and 'free' shipping) make up for it, I think. <end>  Pretty Good  I just got this today. I love it. My only complaint is that the cord it is on is cheap string that flips the necklace around. Other than that I love it. <end>  The title is wrong!  The title is wrong. This is a PENTACLE. The way it's attached to the chain's clip, the point is facing up, making it a pentacle. If the point were facing down, THEN it would be a pentagram. Subtle difference, but there is one. &lt;/3 <end>
 B0006IHS4M  Moving Jaws Dinosaur Skull Real Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Great Item, But a Little Large  Looks exactly like the picture, is of fine quality and was promptly shipped. The bad news is my girlfriend thought it looked more like a cat then dinosaur, and also thought it too large to really wear. Look at the picture with the pen for scale, this is a large pendant (about 2 inches long) so it won't be everyones style. <end>  Cool Gift  My son is a HUGE dinosaur fan. I wanted to get him something cool and different for his 8th birthday. This was the perfect gift. It looks exactly like the picture. He loves it! <end>  Dino Pendant  Received very timely and it was exactly as it appeared on Amazon. Excellent quality and the artist/vendor is great - art and service. <end>

 B0006IIV98  Large Sterling Silver Moon Star Pentacle Onyx Pendant ||	  This is an attention getter!  I've had this necklace for over a year. People always notice it & comment on how beautiful it is!It's about the size of a 50cent piece I guess.

Although small, they are very nicely crafted,and the little diamonds add plenty of sparkle.The packaging was elegant, and the shipping was prompt, as promised.

 B0006IXAN0  Pebbles a Grey Freshwater Cultured Pearl Dangle Earring ||	  Lovely Pearl Earrings  The pearl earrings I ordered came in a very timely fashion (less than a week) and were beautifully packaged. Though they looked large in the picture on the internet, they were actually very delicate and of excellent quality. The recipient and I were both delighted. The earrings in the picture accompanying my comments are not the pearls I ordered. Mine had only a very small silver top with a single pearl hanging from it, about an inch long overall. I would gladly order from this company again. <end>
 B0006JMU62  Two Tone Stylish Retro Hoop Earrings ||	  Beautiful  These earrings are really beautiful, and have a nice weight to them. They move with you without feeling like they drag your ears down. They feel very secure on, and I have slept with them quite comfortably. The satin finish on the yellow gold was surprising because on the picture you can't see it, but it didn't take away from them. I love them and am very happy with my purchase. My order was handled and delivered quickly, so I am quite satisfied with the service too. <end>

The metal is nicely polished and has the right size too. The stone is beautiful and very clearl. The blue is very pretty. They came very fast with a certificate and a pretty box. I would recommend them for sure. <end>  Swiss Blue Topaz Earrings  These were given to me by my lovely hubby for Christmas. I like the fact that they are totally "plain";this allows one to wear the pair w/nearly everything(yes, even your fabulous new bathing suit for summer!!!) There is just one "negative" about the earrings though--really wish that the set was "longer" in length.Anyway, they are very,very well made & the stone is fabulous too----for the $, they look like $200. <end>
 B0006LCMAE  Boma Square Stud Earrings ||	  Perfect Earrings!  These earrings are amazing. I wear them everyday and their small size and unique shape add a little extra something. I even wear them out at night. Best of all, they don't bother my super sensitive ears and have held up very well-no chipping and they stay on really well. I sleep in them! <end>

Prompt delivery and more then what I had expected in a stud earring.Excellent in every aspect of transaction.Thank you! <end>  Huge!  These earrings were pretty on the internet.

 B0006LCQY6  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 1 1/2 cttw Heart Shape ||	  great pair of everyday earrings  This is a good item for a great price... but it was slightly higher priced than any of its colored siblings.

They are great! lovely quality, fast shipping... definitely a good buy. <end>  Ok  Not as big as the last ones I got but they are ok just too small ... <end>

 B0006MTR3S  Queen Chess Piece Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  A decent little piece of Geek jewelry  Pretty good item for the money you spend for it. It's a fairly simple piece of jewelry, about an inch in length and fairly light. You can't quite tell from the pictures, but it's missing the back half to allow it to lay on the skin better. That may be a good, or a bad thing for you, depending what you're looking for. <end>
 B0006N2ON2  Sterling Silver, Stainless Steel and Crystal Star Belly Bar by Paris Hilton ||	  Paris Hilton Swarowski belly ring  The ring is so adorable and it really sparkles in the sunlight but after about one month of use some of the stones started popping of and already 5 are missing. Just wanted to advise. <end>  Nice Bling for My Belly  i really like this navel ring, but wonder how long it will be before a crystal falls out. i have the pink heart one and after several months, i noticed a crystal had sunk. i do not if it actually fell out and there is a matching shiny base beneath it, or, as previously stated, it sunk. that is what promted me to get this one. as far as looks go, i like this more that the heart bar. craftmanship? i am very glad that i did not waste big buck on the more expensive items in the paris hilton collection. i am still contemplating buying the Star Earrings <end>  Hate to admit, but it is cute  Much nicer looking than the belly rings you typically find at the mall. It is very sparkly and detailed. Definitely worth the sale price ($10). <end>  nice  its a real nice belly button ring, but the ball part was to small for my girlfriends hole and it wouldnt hold. <end>  I love this belly ring@@@@@@@@@@  It's so sexy! Great packaging. Perfect gift for a friend also. <end>  GREAT BUY!  This belly bar is awesome. It looks so nice and they are inexpensive. I wish it is the summer already so I can wear them with my bikini ^.^ <end>  My favorite piece of belly jewelry!  I love this belly bar, it's one of my favorites - I even lost my first one playing softball so I reordered a new one right away. <end>  awesome!  yeah! im first -D ok i got the heart beally bar first n then i got this one n i love both of them this ones actually better cuz the blue crystals contrast w tanned body! but yea i love this belly bar ;) hehe THX PARIS !!! ;) btw U ROCK GIRL !!hahahyeah!!!  * <end>
 B0006N7J8W  Surgical Steel 9mm Wedding Band Ring Polished Center Matte Finish Beveled Edges, sizes 7 - 14 ||	  Quality Ring  This is a great ring, it looks great and the price was awesome! It looks like it should be much more expensive. <end>  Perfect!  I bought this for my husband to take the place of his wedding band that had to be cut off his finger before surgery. The first one I received was too large but the company was terrific about making the exchange for a smaller size. The new ring fits perfectly and looks fantastic. Fast shipping, nice quality product, I would definitely buy from this company again. <end>  Silver Ring  This is a very pretty ring for the price. I it is heavy duty and good quality. My husband loves his. <end>  nice ring  I have the habit of loosing rings. After 20 years of marriage three gold bands have disappeared. So I bought this band as a low cost replacement. This surgical steel ring is of excellent quality and can take the dings and bangs I give it working in my shop or around the yard. The metal is thick. It would take a good bang from a hammer to bend it. If you're looking for a simple ring that's affordable you can't go wrong with this one. <end>  I love it!  I love this ring, it is so beautiful and comfortable. It is all around a great ring. <end>  EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!  Excellent service.Shipped product out very quicly.Very good price for a vey good ring.I have told all my friend,about,SABRINAS SILVER. <end>  Muy buena joyer&iacute;a  Realmente vale la pena. Yo compre esta sortija para mi novio y realmente es muy buena. <end>  Stainless Steel D. B. Ring with Polishe center 10  Excellent service. This item arrived on time. Congratulations.Jan. 29, 2006 <end>  Beautiful  I bought two for our wedding coming up and they are so beautiful,and look like I spent alot but they were an excellent price. I would definately recommend for anyone that is "hard" on jewelery and that enjoys the look of silver/steel over gold. <end>  Price Is Right  I bought this ring as an extra for my husband so he could wear it to his construction job. I didn't want him wearing his original diamond ring that I pd $1200 for, so gave this one a try. To my surprise this ring is very nice, clean finish. Also is very durable, I would purchase from this company again. <end>  Great Ring  Great Ring for the price. Shinier than the image but a great all around ring. Scratches easily but that was expected. I bought it for everyday use so I have something to figit with. <end>  Pretty ring, great customer service  It's a nice ring. Looks great. But the outstanding thing is Sabrina - they shipped product out very quickly. I goofed with wrong ring size due to Amazon size chart (definitely, get a professional to size you, although he ended up giving me a too small size too) and Sabrina changed it with no hassles, quickly. <end>  the ring  The ring I purchased was to replace my hubbys wedding ring which he lost at work..(it fell off because he lost about 60 lbs) if he loses this one I know where to go to replace it again...and it won't cost as much as the original...thank you. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself...three grown men on hands and knees looking thru piles of wood chips for that ring. <end>  true to fit item  I actually returned this item for a different style. I have a vey small hand and the 9mm width was just too much for me. So I exchanged with no problems at all for a better fit. I will buy from this company again. They were very helpful. <end>  Great Purchase  The ring was perfect and in great condition! I would recommend this to anyone.This was a really great purchase I made. <end>  Nice and inexpensive  Nice looking inexpensive ring. No complaints. Better than spending a large amount on a ring that looks the same. <end>  As Expected...........  The ring was just as the ad had said it would be. I get many compliments. Service was excellent. I sent the ring back for a bigger size. It was exchanged without any problem. I would order from the company again without hesitation. <end>  I love it  I bought this ring to see if i liked larger rings and i ended up just wearing this one and not getting a better one. I like it a lot! <end>  buying rings online is just hard.  buying rings online is just hard. It's either too loose or too tight and you end up wearing on another finger. <end>  Good for the price  You get exactly what you pay for. The ring is solid and looks nice, but does tend to get scratched and scuffed. One thing not so clear in the description or the picture is that the ring has a significantly hard outer edge to it. It's almost completely unnoticeable, (to me, anyway), but might be uncomfortable for some when putting the ring on if the fit is a little tight. Other than that, a good buy. I wear mine just about every day, and it fits comfortably and complements my other ring well. <end>  Nice  Needed a wedding band replacement. Lost my very expensive band in the ocean. This is inexpensive but looks great. I love it and will buy another for a back-up. <end>  Great Ring-Great Company-Will be Back!  Ring looks just like pic (someone earlier said it didn't???). Sabrina Silver was great. Arrived nicely packaged and timely. Had to return for size (order this one a little big). The company switched it-no problem-and returned within 2 weeks of me mailing it-from GA to CA!!!We will definately order from Sabrina Silver again and again and again! <end>  even better in person!  ordered this ring for my husband to wear to work so that he doesnt hurt his more expensive ring and am pleasently surprised at the quality.it looks way better in person than in the picture and he says it feels great on! we also recieved the ring within 3days of it being shipped from the seller so that was a plus as well. <end>  a good value  This is a good ring. It looks good, Its comfortable, and it doesn't cost a lot. And, as every jewelry maker knows, a ring gets the worst beating and wear of any kind of jewelry, so being stainless steel helps it stand up to wear. <end>  silver ring  I have order from this company befroe and everything that I have recieved was awsome. I couldn't ask for anything better and with Amazon i get it super quick. I have came back to order other stuff and it's all the same great service. <end>  nice  I bought this to try surgical steel. It feels smooth, and today I wore it as a thumb ring. Shipment arrived promptly and in good condition. It really is quite pretty and would make a nice wedding band for a man. <end>  great but easily scratched  its a really nice ring but it scuffed within the first day of wearing it... maybe it's just that my boyfriend is too rough with it, but who knows. <end>  Love my ring...  This ring is beautiful. Wanted a metal which would hold up under abuse for someone who works with their hands. This fit the bill on beauty & ruggedness.The only "downside" that I didn't consider was 8mm covers almost the whole area between my knuckle & the joint of my finger. I do have small hands for a man & 8mm looks huge on me. If you are a man with hands like me...consider a 6 or 7 mm band.As for Sabrina Silver...got the ring more quickly & in great shape than what I was expecting. At the cost of almost any jewelry Sabrina has available...you can get anything you want at a fraction of the cost of a retail shop. Will do business again with Sabrina Silver when I am ready to purchase more men's jewelry. <end>  makes great visual appearance  its looks good, not much more to tell. not much more to tell, not much more to tell, bye bye <end>  nice!  Very nice. He has a large hand so the 9 mm is perfect. Heavier and better quality than expected for the price. It does run small. Ordered his usual 12 but now ordering a 12.5. Otherwise, Highly recommend! <end>  Pinky Love!  Great piece of jewelry and at a great price. It stays on my pinky at all times. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cost effective product. <end>  Very nice ... But some problems  Very nice looking ring. Sizing isnt accurate, mine is waaaaaay too big. Tge edges of tge ribg seem sharper than normal but great ring for price <end>  Good Gift  Ordered this ring for a small Christmas gift. Love it. Looks great. I know my husband will like it, and it will save wear and tear on his good band. The shipping, too, was exceptional. The ring went out quickly and arrived two days before estimated and was packaged in a nice little box.  ) Love that! Thanks, Sabrina. <end>  VERY NICE RING!!  THIS RING LOOK JUST LIKE IT DID IN THE PICTURE!I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE THIS RING.IT WEARS AND FITS VERY GOOD ! I WILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN! <end>  Very nice ring  Length   0 53 MinsThe ring Looks great, and feel great, it's well done, polished, and feels durable. nothing to complain about the ring. just one thing about the seller, that send me a 9.5 ring instead of a 10, not a big deal for the price,maybe this particular ring has a wrong scale, because the other 6 rings ive bougth together are ok in size, its just this that was wrong. ive uploaded a video, with the ring and the size bar ive used. <end>  Husband is still wearing it.  I bought this for my husband because his job is really hard on his wedding bands. I figured even if it didn't hold up very well (like most of his rings) then it was cheap enough to replace often. He has has it since June and he is still wearing it. It is not nearly as shiny as when he first got it. He only wears this ring to work and then wears the expensive ring the rest of the time. That way he is not ruining his real wedding band. <end>  irritating  looks great, fits great, but after one day of wear i was having a skin reaction under the band. i kept it on for another day and it kept getting worse. i switched hands to be sure and had the same problem. it took a week for the rash to go away. at least it was cheap, but still annoying. <end>  Very nice  This ring is much nicer than I had expected. I bought it for my husband because in the military he needs to take it off while doing his job so that it doesn't get caught on anything and I the price was a steal I figured it would fall out of his pocket or something (which it did) and he liked it so much he asked me to repurchase so I will be doing that very shortly. <end>
 B0006N8ZQC  St. Christopher Surf Medal - Small Aquamarine/White ||	  Such an amazing item...  I love my saint christopher pendant and the shipping was so fast that I bought two more for each of my sisters. <end>  GREAT SELLER & UNIQUE PRODUCT  Thank you for this unique product. Great seller, fast shipment and product as described. Would recommend this sellers to others! Thank you much!! <end>  Different color then what was shown  Quick shipping. The necklace came with the meaning and was just like what I buy in Hawaii. The only problem is when I received it it was a different blue then what I ordered. More of a teal. I might have returned it to try to get the right color but it was a gift. <end>  really happy  I saw this all over hawaii when I went, very popular. I love traveling and surfing so its very meaningful to me. <end>
 B0006NVKFU  3 Diamond Princess Cut Anniversary Band 1/2 ct. in 14K White Gold with Blue Center Diamond ||	  3 Diamond Princess Cut 1/2 ct (GHI / SI3-I1) Anniversary Band in 14k White Gold w/ Center Diamond Blue  I just brought my ring in to get resized. I was given a 7 and had it brought down to a six. I have always loved my ring, because of its beauty, but I don't really know much about gold, or diamonds. I mean, I don't really know what makes a good diamond vs. a "bad" diamond. When I went back to pick up my ring, the jeweler told me that my ring is really well made. The diamonds are of great quality, and the band is top notch! I didn't really know how to respond, other than to say, "thank you!" He went on and on about how he loved my ring. It just surprised me because the last time my boyfriend bought me a ring, 6 years ago, (which I had to get resized, also), the same jeweler said to me, "you know the diamonds aren't real, right?" Haha. No, I didn't, but I still loved that ring. I didn't have the heart to tell my boyfriend. I got my ring as a Valentines gift, and it was a little big. My guy must have done a little jewelery research this time around. It is so beautiful; I didn't want to part with it. Not even for a couple of hours, to get it resized. I finally had to cave (9 months later), because my job requires me to work a lot with my hands, and I didn't want it to slip off and get lost. You will love this ring. The diamonds sparkle radiantly! The gold shines marvelously! It is stunning! <end>
 B0006O1H7U  Sterling Silver Mother of Pearl Marcasite Cross Pendant ||	  Sterling Silver Mother of Pearl Marcasite Cross Pendant  Nice cross; however, a piece fell offthat I needed to glue back on. Forthe price was ok. <end>
 B0006O1H84  Large Egyptian Cross Ankh of Life Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Love it...  I ordered this pendant, along with a 1mm 16" snake chain, and it arrived inside a black velvet pouch inside the shipping box. It is stamped ".925" on the back of the pendant and on the loop that hangs from the chain. The marcasite catches the light, but blends in with the rest of the design, which is nice. My only complaint is that the long part of the ankh is fragile and I was able to bend it slightly. Something to be careful about. <end>  crazy  WISH some people wouldn't right reviews. The truth of the matter is the item is cheap. It's paperthin, completely bendable. And very small. Comes with no chain & it is in a cheap black "velvet" style bag! And to add insult to injury the seller charges $5.00 to ship you the piece of junk!! Not recommended. <end>
 B0006O1H9S  Sterling Silver Long Oval Genuine Baltic Amber Pendant ||	  Halloween Costume Jewelry  This item was cheaply constructed. I would not recommend buying it unless you are going to use it as part of a halloween costume. <end>
 B0006OAEXI  14K Gold and Sterling Silver Native American Symbol Eternity Band ||	  A really special gift  When I opened these rings I was amazed at just how beautiful and striking they are. I especially like the Native American symbolism. The man that received the other ring was as impressed as I was. The price is phenominal. <end>  Size counts  I saw this ring and had to get it for my daughter!! she recently found out she is indian..I gave her the ring and she loved it! she tryed it on and it was a half size to small,so i had to send it back. I looked to see if there was a larger size but there wasn't, I even e-mailed the company but no response. If you can find this ring in a larger size i would love to buy it again!!Thank You <end>  great  beautiful made- perfect-- wish it came in other sizes- difficult to find a jewler to size it--thick band needs lazer-- <end>

 B0006OATA6  0.85 Carat Sterling Silver CZ Flower Pendant ||	  Good Deal!!  This pendant is very pretty, it looks very believable! My only problem was it came with a regular chain instead of the ball chain as pictured. I still love it, it's a great pendant that looks like it should be worth more!!! <end>
 B0006OATFQ  1.5 Carat Sterling Silver CZ Cross Earrings ||	  Not what I hoped for  These earrings are hard to latch. I ended up loosing one becuase they don't stay latched either. The quality isn't very good at all. <end>  Great earings and very comfortable too....  These are great. They are very pretty, and easy to wear. I am a big "hugger" and they are so comfortable! You can sleep in them, shower, you name it....They are a great buy! Thank You. <end>
 B0006OATG0  1 Carat Sterling Silver CZ Hoop Earrings ||	  Cute little hoops  These hoops are a little smaller than I expected, but they are cute and dainty. Good for everyday wear. <end>  Sterling Silver CZ Earrings  I love these earrings, they look really sparkly on. The only thing I would mention is that the first time I wore them one fell out of my ear. The post just needing adjusting to connect better. They came in a gorgeous Chinese style pink holder with a pop button which is really pretty and you can store more than just the earrings in there, so I would say it's ideal for a gift. <end>  love them!  i am so happy with these; they are now my second favorite pair of earrings, my real diamond studs being number 1. some stated here they are too small, but they were exactly what i wanted... i'm guessing everyone's ear's are different sizes and perhaps if you have large lobes or your piercing is situated high, then they may be considered small. i'm thinking of putting up a customer image so you can see what it looks like on my 37-year-old earlobes... seriously, if you're looking for understated quaint sparkling earrings, buy these!i will do business with again. <end>  Casual or Dress!  These are a great pair of small, comfortable earrings that can be worn with casual or dressy atire. The latch to hook and lock them together works very well and is one of the better designs I've seen and used. I've worn them a few times already and have had no problems with them. I wish I would have gone ahead and gotten 2 pairs (knowing the way I go through earrings). You can't go wrong with these, they are small, yet not too small. <end>  Great service  I've purchased from this company before and they always get my order right out. Never any problems. <end>  good product  I love this earings i wore this every day they are beautiful and cheap. <end>  Great buy  Love them. Nice weight. Stones look very real as well very glad I got them and have been complimented several times on them <end>  high quality. great price. no allergy  These were a gift for a little girl. I purchased a gold pair for myself. I like that these lock and are all one piece. I highly recommend these. <end>  So great for the price!  I bought these as a Christmas gift for someone and I was so amazed at how great they looked I ordered a pair for myself. They're perfect with everything! <end>  Looks real.  These earings look like the real thing. They are great looking, easy to put on and go great with everything I wear. <end>  5 stars  I bought this pair a long time ago, and they still look like new. Sturdy hinges, great "glitz", and the size is just right  you see them (I got many compliments), but they are not overwhelming. I just ordered a second pair for travels! <end>  Perfect!!!  This earrings are absolutely gorgeous! They are small and delicate in appearance. The weight is neither too heavy nor too light. The quality is wonderful. I have slept in these earrings, and never have to worry about losing them. They are shiny, and the cz's sparkle like the real deal. These are by far my favorite earrings. <end>  Love them!  I bought these for myself for my birthday, and must say they are perfect. They aren't too big to wear everyday. And they don't just blend in. <end>  Awesome!  I absolutely love these earrings! While I was wearing them I got compliments left and right. My only problem is that I lost one of the earrings...So now I am ready to buy another pair!! <end>  wonderful!  awesome! i really love them, i haven't taken them off since i opened the package, which arrived 2 days early!! I was so excited to get them early, and my mom is very jealous...she wants a pair too.i get tons of comments every day on them, and i think they'd make a great gift! <end>  Diamond Look Sterling Huggie Earrings  I bought two pair of the same earrings so that when I next lose one I will have a spare(s).They are understated, elegant and suitable for wearing with any outfit, from casual to dressy. They look like the real deal (diamonds set in either white gold or platinum). <end>  Value for Money _ Really good office weat  These are not as small as some may think - Very nice pair - not too gaudy not the dull types too - u can use both sides- One side as CZ and the other side is soft plain metal.Really good buy - For sure office wear- Wont say u cant wear with a dress - But may not be the fancy types or flasshy types if your looking for one like that. <end>  Cute and dainty earrings!  I was surprised when I received these earrings of how small they were! I don't think in the description they ever gave a size. They are about a 1/2" wide. However, they are cute and I like how they latch! Overall, I would recommend these earrings to anyone looking for cute dainty earrings! <end>  Love the earrings  I received my earring quickly, and I haven't taken them out yet. They are wonderful! <end>  Great earrings!  These are really nice for the price!! I was not expecting something that looks as nice for everyday wear, and for such a low price, even if I were to lose one, I would miss the earrings more than what I spent!! Highly recommended for someone who wants a simple little hoop with a bit of sparkle. <end>  Hoop Earrings  I love the earrings, yes thay are small but very big in sparkle and very beautiful on, thay look like real diamonds. <end>  Very nice  I love this earrings. They are a little big bigger then I expected but I like it. <end>  Small ears  I really love this pair of hoops, they are at a size to wear I would feel comfortable wearing them everyday. I am going to be buying another pair for my second ear piercing. <end>  Great little Earrings!  These earrings are awesome, they go with almost everything. A great all purpose accessory. <end>  Would not use this seller again  These are pretty, but very small- which is to be expected when you look at the measurement on the photo. But somehow I missed that when I originally decided to buy them. So that's my fault. What is not my fault is that the seller took 5 days from the time I ordered to process and finally ship them! The same day I bought these, I also bought 2 other items from different sellers. Those items both came before this one even shipped, and they were all shipped using standard shipping. That tells me that this seller is not up to par with the others. In any case, it should not take 5 days to process an order unless it is in a separate warehouse or on backorder. If that's the case, they never notified me I'd have to wait. Unfortunately for me, I suspect the items will still get here within the approximated time, so I won't be able to file a claim. This review doesn't have much at all to do with the product- it's the seller and their slow processing time. Even if the item still gets here "on time" it's the principal of the thing. You shouldn't order something and have to wait 5 days before they tell you it's finally shipping out- the item should already be there! Anyways, I still like Amazon, but it seems to be hit or miss with their marketplace stores! <end>  Nothing special  I expected this product to be a little better than what it is (based on the picture). However, nothing special in it. It is quite small and not that eye-catching. But compared to the price I shouldn't have expected more than this. <end>  Okay but thats all  The CZ does not sparkle at all, I doubt it is even CZ at all. It looks like gumball plastic. One of the hoops broke about a week after wearing them. Shame because I liked the hidden lock. The design seemed good enough to be considered contemporary not cheesy but oh well. <end>  I Love them and If they were free and I'm a cridic and if you give me free stuff  i think this is a high class of a product and If it was free for a cridic Like me I would tell. all my family and friends to buy things on amazon.com and mabe dimonds too <end>  very nice!  these earrings are really very nice...and the price is even nicer. they are a really good size, very shiny and are perfect with any outfit. Buy them! you will be really glad you did. <end>  great value!  I just got this as a gift for my wife. She loves it. It was perfect. The size was great for her. All her friends think it is real diamonds. Thank you. <end>  Love them!  i Bought a pair of these for my friend and she loved them! they are elegant enought ot wair on everything! Would definately buy them again.. <end>  Cool Hoops  Really great quality for the price. The hinges are well made so I don't worry about them falling apart when I wear them. They are not white gold and diamonds. They are what they claim to be  Silver and CZ. I like them!! <end>  Buying them again!  I bought this pair of earrings for myself over a year ago...when they were new to Amazon (no reviews). I wanted something that looked pretty but didn't cost me a lot. I loved them....loved them so much that when I lost one down my sink drain, I wanted to buy another pair. I am currently waiting to receive my second pair. For the price and the beauty, why not! No one will know they aren't real diamonds. <end>  Good choise.  I got these earrings today and absolutely love them. You can wear them with jeans or a dress. Very elegant looking and almost looks real! I would definitely recommend them to anyone/ <end>  Love it!  I read the reviews for these earrings and I am very pleased with the results. I purchased my own pair and get plenty of compliments too. <end>  VERY PLEASED!!!  I am very happy with these earrings! Big enough to see, but not gaudy.. They are exactly what I wanted & I would not hesitate to buy again!!! <end>  GORGEOUS!!!  I PURCHASED THESE EARRINGS BASED ON THE REVIEWS..AND EVERYONE IS RIGHT...THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS AND YOU CANNOT TELL THEM FROM THE REAL THING...I HAVE WORE THEM EVERYDAY SINCE I PURCHASED THEM...THEY GO WITH EVERY OUTFIT AND JUST LOOK GREAT...SPEEDY SERVICE...PROMPT SHIPMENT...YOU JUST CANNOT ASK FOR BETTER <end>  Can't Go Wrong With CoolStyles.Com!!  These earrings are beautiful! Very delicate tho, right when I received them I put them on and they broke! But that's ok because the wonderful seller (CoolStyles) said they would send me a new pair and sure enough in todays mail were my earrings!!! They look and sparkle just like real diamonds! And you cant beat the price for sterling silver, they actually look like white gold! So lets review....$8.99 for beautiful, sterling silver diamond look-a-likes, fast shipping, and GREAT sellers that go out of their way to make a customer happy! OH!! And they come in a very pretty satin zip pouch! HIGHLY RECOMMEND SELLER!! You cant go wrong! <end>  Good product, fast delivery, happy camper.  I ordered these earrings five days ago and have them now. I selected the regular shipping and the delivery estimate was March 22nd-26th. Today is the 21st. Ahead of schedule! This is the second time this has happened with Cool Styles. The product is exactly what I expected as well. <end>  LOVE THEM  I just received these earrings today and I was a little afraid they would be too small but they are just perfect!! They sparkle just like real diamonds and are so comfortable I don't even know I have them on.Experience with sller was great, no complaints <end>  it's easy take out&#12289;  I liked the earrings, looks good, but too easy to fall off an earring clasp is not tight, very bad, and the other fortunately <end>  Look great! Good Value.  They look really nice and my wife loves them.She wanted something to wear while sleeping and at work (she's a nurse) that wasn't expensive and were comfortable. These fit the bill perfectly.Delivery was fast, too. <end>  Fits good  Nice earrings. Great value for the price as well. Fits right on the ear as I desired it to. Buy <end>  Beautiful but large  Bigger than I thought and a bit heavy but looks like real diamonds and looks great with everything not too flashy but classy enough for a night out too. <end>  EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICE  I FIND THESE GUYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BE EXCEPTIONAL. THE PRODUCT I RECEIVED WAS BETTER THAN THE PICTURE AND BETTER THAN THEY HAD DESCRIBED. THE EARRINGS I GOT WOULD HAVE COST 75.00 OR MORE IN A RETAIL STORE. I WAS AMAZED AT THE QUALITY OF THESE PRODUCTS. YOU CAN BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AND BE ASSURED THAT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOME OF THE BEST I HAVE RECEIVED DURING MY HOLIDAY SHOPPING. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY FROM THESE GUYS AND I AM PLACING ANOTHER ORDER TODAY. EXCEPTIONAL AND ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS SERVICE..GREAT COMPANY..YOU CAN TRUST THIS COMPANY AND THEIR PRODUCTS. GO TAKE A LOOK YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT THE PRICES IN COMPARISON TO THE QUALITY. THE SAVINGS YOU WILL GET IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS..I COULDNT BELIEVE IT..!! GREAT JOB!!~~ <end>  I only wear one pair  And this is it. Simple, understated and elegant, these make the perfect statement at my uber-conservative job in financial services. These tell clients that the wearer is polished, but low-maintenance, more concerned with producing a good product than in promoting flashy appearances. <end>  Very pretty.  Classy little hoop. I made purchase for a gift to my mother. It was hard for me to wrap up and give away , because I liked them soo much. The price was great for this quality item. <end>  super  muy buen producto llego a tiempo lo pedi desde venezuela y gracias pq es justo lo que queria compre aqui <end>  Beautiful!!!  Nice quality earring and the price is perfect. They are the earrings I wear most. I plan to buy another pair to give as a gift. Worth the money! <end>  cz stering earrings, by coolstyles.com  I like these earrings a lot. They look real, they're comfortable. The only thing I caution on, is the way they clasp on. They are not very secure, if removing a shirt, they are subject to coming out of your ear. I have had this happen numerous times now. Luckily, I haven't lost one. <end>  Awesome deal!  Quick shipping. These are very nice. They look like white gold with diamonds. No one will know they are CZ unless you tell them! Be gentle with them when clicking them closed - otherwise you can bend the wire and they won't snap closed easily. <end>  Nive everyday hoops  I love these earrings. Unlike other small hoops, the diamond looks very round . I like the clarity of the CZ. Very classy looking, durable earrings. Very pleased. <end>  follow up to earlier review  How disappointing that these beautiful earrings caused my ears to become infected - the first time in decades! Anyway, if you don't have an allergy problem these are for you. They are gorgeous, well made and beautiful. Just not for sensitive ears. I'm soooo disappointed. <end>  Pretty but flawed  I have had these for about a month. Worn about three times and the backings have bent to the point where it is now difficult to put them on. I have had many compliments about them and they are comfortable and nice looking, but I just don't think they will last long. I will only wear them on occassion at this point becasue I don't think they would last a whole week of use. Disappointed, but keeping them until I can afford the real thing. <end>  bad.  I dont recomend it, these earrings are small, and the clasp broke already, im not happy.pleas try to correct this product for customer satisfaction,thank you ,sincerely Patty Figueroa <end>  Very average  The earrings are okay in finishing and craftsmanship, but the hook is not secure. I am going to lose one of them soon certainly and because of this I end up not wearing them often. <end>  Great Company!!  I purchased these earrings for my daughter and she loved them. However, a stone had dislodged in shipping. I called CoolStyles and they immediately sent her a new pair. They were pleasant to deal with and I certainly would order from them again. <end>  CZ Hoop Earrings  These earrings are really nice. They look just like real diamonds and are the perfect fit. The picture does not do them justice. These earrings sparkle very nicely and have a clean cut to them. Perfect if you cant afford the real thing. <end>  pretty  These are small but very pretty and very real looking. I wear them every day! <end>  very happy!  I wear these earrings all the time! Have the right amt. of bling for the day and plenty for a night out too! For the price, I could not be happier. Perfect size too, can sleep with them, even wear a motorcycle helmet and not feel them! Only change, would be to make the latch more secure ( so far, only came loose when I take off my helmet). <end>  Cute, go well with everything, and hold well.  These close pretty securely and go well with everything. I have these in the second hole in my ears, and will usually wear something dangly in the first hole. Very nice choice. <end>  Great Customer Service  I ordered these and received them in a timely manner but one earring in my order was defective. I e-mailed CoolStyles right away and they sent a replacement right away. I was very impressed by their quick response and great customer service. Oh, and the earrings are beautiful! <end>  Cool Styles Rocks!  These earrings are exactly what I was looking for and they are very beautiful.Thank you for the great service as well! <end>  Lovely and believable  These little earrings are slightly bigger than huggies, just the size I wanted. My jewelry-saavy daughter saw them lying on a table and asked if they were real. I have gold and real diamond hoops, but find I wear these more often. No problems with clasps. The smooth edges mean they don't catch in my hair, they are even comfortable to sleep in. $$ well spent. <end>  The perfect earrings!  I love these earrings. Small chunky hoops, about an inch in diameter - the perfect size. Not to big but still large enough to get noticed. A very expensive look for something that isn't too costly.I like that the clasp is a clasp and not a post. These earrings are not going to come out. They are comfortable to wear, even to bed which sometimes I do when I forget to take them out.The silver goes with everything and the cubic zirconium looks enough like diamonds that people mistake this for the real deal. <end>  They look real!  These earrings are a wonderful deal for the money. I can wear these earrings in my first hole, and my real 14kt white gold and diamond earrings in the second hole and they blend perfectly. That's what I call a good quality earring! Don't hesitate to buy, I'm picky and would not even write a review unless the item is outstanding. Buy with confidence  ) <end>  loving these and haven't taken off yet  Shine very nicely and look like they could be real... Nice size. Adding to my silver collection. Think that it looks better on with my summer color then gold. <end>  Awesome  I love everything about them except the clasp. I think the size is perfect, they are very eye catching and latch easily but can unlatch just as easily and then I lose these earrings that I am so attached to.I don't know why people are complaining about the size when they look exactly like they should. <end>  love these earrings  I have had these earrings for four years now and they look just as beautiful as the day I got them. They are a sturdy, beautiful pair of earrings that you can wear everyday and you don't have to worry if you should happen to lose one -- just order another pair. <end>  Beautiful product  My earrings would not latch when I received them. I sent a email to the sender they promptly responded to my request and replaced the broken ones in a timely matter. <end>  Great Buy  This was a great buy. Very pretty earrings at a great price. Came in a nice pouch. <end>  Diamond Hoops  I was shocked when I received these earrings. They are quite small -- more for a child than an adult. All in all, they are beautiful and my husband thought they were real! The price is right! <end>  cool ear rings  As I said in my review of the bracelet, (which I bought together), I thought from the pictures that they might be bigger, however my wife was pleasantly surprised.They look much more expensive than they are. This is my first experience with cz but not my last (we're remodling a house). I recommend this seller for their shipping & quality of merchandise. <end>  I couldn't be happier  I had been looking at diamond earrings and even bought some off ebay which I returned because they didn't sparkle at all and I couldn't get them off once I put them on! I decided to give CZ a try. These are beautiful. Great sparkle. Small enough so they're not gaudy. Very comfortable. I haven't taken them off since I got them. <end>  Beautiful!  I purchased these earrings because I wanted to give CZ a try and they were inexpensive. They are fabulous! They look and feel real. My husband who's really picky about any jewelry looking phony was really impressed. <end>  Earrings are nice but BEWARE shipping charges!!  On this almost 9$ pair of earrings SecureHoop charged me 30$ for shipping! That is outragious! <end>  One dollar shipping  I don't know what that other person is talking about. Shipping was a dollar when I ordered the earrings. They're very petite and pretty; and they go with just about anything. I'm very happy with them. <end>  good things are small things  This item was a birthday gift for my mother. She loves small earrings and really loves these. I don't think she has gone a day without wearing them since i gave them to her. Thanks Jaki <end>  Pretty while it lasted  These came as described, and were great... For a few weeks. I used them for daily wear. Before long, the earrings would not stay clasped and the posts bent. Not worth the price, or the wait. <end>  hoop earrings  What a buetiful set of earrings Loving them they are so easy to wear and Sparkle always Im so happy with them they are a great product to buy Thanks <end>  Very Nice/Sparkly Hoops In Beginning  I did not think for the price I would receive such nice quality hoop earrings. Arrived quickly and very nice quality for sterling silver and nice cz quality as well. Will order again!! I love hoops that are not too big yet show up and make me shine   )Amazon always comes thru.UPDATE Aug. 8th...I already lost 1 earring. No, I will not re purchase. Disappointed as they were pretty in the beginning. Just not well made I guess.   ( Back to searching for a great, small and well made hoop with sparkle. <end>  VERY PLEASED ' THX  I am so pleased with these earrings, I would recommend buying them to anybody! They are so beautiful, and look so real. I am very HAPPY. I will continue to buy from COOLSTYLES. O'h and I received them a day early!!!! So happy... Kimberly J.' <end>  they are pretty but...  so pretty but, the magnet on them wears out. such a shame. would love to wear the every day.otherwise they are fab! <end>  Clyde  I'm a guy and i just received this, not too big not too small i wear this on the top part of my ear "cartilage"... would definitely recommend these for those who want the small hoop around the top part of the ear... comes with a pair so if you loose one you'll have a back up...very fast shipping great deal. <end>  Perfect small hoops  I ordered these because they are very similar to my favorite earrings and I had lost one of them. The price is very reasonable and they are the perfect size for me to wear to work. Because of the type of closure they have, they do not poke me in the head when I'm on the phone. The earrings are well made and the sterling is substantial. I'm thinking about ordering a 2nd pair just in case because this is the best price I've seen for earrings like this. <end>  Nice but small  Yes, I read the size before ordering, but still smaller than I imagined. They look to be high quality however and are nice looking earrings. All in all, I am pleased, especially for the price. <end>  Nice earrings for my daughter  These earrings were the perfect size for my daughter. They are attractive. The hoop does not close as tightly as I would like and they have fallen out twice, but I like them and hope that we can keep track of them. I would also wear them as a small, casual every day pair of earrings. <end>  Beautiful and worth the price!  A lot of people have told me that they thought the earrings had real diamonds. They are small just as some other reviewers had mentioned but that's exactly what I was looking for. The only thing that worries me are the hinges. They seem a bit weak but I don't think they should be a problem if you're careful. Overall, great product and great price! <end>  i am editing my review  i wanted to write a review on this product but i lost one of the earrings within 24 hours of wearing them. i was very very sad..... THEN!!! i found the earring in my garden but the clasp was not working properly and that's why it fell out of my ear.so, i contacted the seller and they sent me a new pair right away!what great customer service!!!!!the earrings are gorgeous!!!!beautiful and classy with anything you wear. <end>
 B0006OFXR0  Sterling Silver Faithful Heart Easter Cross Pendant ||	  My Mom's Christmas Gift - She LOVES It!  I bought this months ago (on sale), and wrapped it up as one of my traditional "Santa" gifts for my mom, along with a pair of black diamond stud earrings. I placed the cross pendant--which is substantial in size--on an 18 inch black satin cord. She was here this past week for my oldest's college graduation and we had a small gift exchange the night before. My mom LOVES this pendant! She wore it to the graduation, and it looked stunning against her burgandy sweater. My mom normally doesn't go for jewelry that's big or bold; this pendant is feminine with the filigree work. It's a beautiful expression of her faith. If you'll notice in the picture, there's a heart design at the center of the cross.Note  One of the the things I love most about Carolyn Pollack's jewelry is that the silver used is recycled and most of her jewelry is made in the USA. <end>  larger than expected  This item is larger than expected but was one half the price of the same item on Carolyn Pollock's website. <end>  Disappointed  I guess it depends on what you like, but I expected this to have a bit more of an oxidized look and it is very shiny, which, to me is kind of inconsistent with the style of the design. <end>
 B0006OGACM  Classic Diamond Solitaire Ring 1/10ct ||	  Classic and simple  This is a very nice, classic looking ring. But be aware that it's a lot smaller than how it appears in the picture. <end>  Simple Beauty  The beauty in this ring is it's simplicity. The solitaire is smaller than the picture implies, but it is still very lovely. <end>  whao not a wow  Picture has the incorrect diamond.Didn't think the diamond would be puny small as a nose stud diamond and it's hanging from those claws(not even touching the bottom). <end>
 B0006OJ4WK  Genuine Amethyst Cabochon Studs Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Beautiful amethyst and marcasite earrings  These are beautiful amethyst, sterling silver and marcasite earrings. The package was delivered in a timely manner. I would buy from this seller again. <end>
 B0006OJ4XE  Egyptian Eye of Horus Silver Tone Pewter Amulet Pendant 20" Woven Leather Necklace ||	  awesome  I purchaed this Item, it's really very beautiful, better in person.I have gotten a lot of complements on itI also wear it for "protection"...hope it works, I am a great beleiver in different types of amulets, and bracelets. I wear MALA bracelets, also wear every day my Kuan Yin pendant, so I have added this to my collectionJust my owm beleifs......Thanks <end>  Okay Eye of Horus  The hook for the chain is too small...you can only wear this pendant with the less then perfect chain that comes with it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is a true Eye of Horus lover you are stuck with the tiny chain that comes with it. Would have been better with larger loop so one can interchange other chains....Just okay... <end>  Egyptian Eye of Horus Pendant  I love this necklace. It appears exactly as it does in the photo. The details are excellent. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a pendant of this nature. <end>  Cheap?  First off. When I initially got this item I was incredibly happy. Estatic even. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. The only problems I had at first were minor. The chain was too small for me to wear comfortably, and for added protection, I doubled the hoop thing that the necklace goes through. Other than that, I was happy.But after wearing it a couple days, I've noticed the back of the pendant has started to wrap/bubble. And it kind of creeps me out. I don't know why. I guess it seems kind of cheap. The main reason I wanted to buy it was to wear, but I don't want to wear it if it'll disintergrate on me, or have the bubbling become worse.Still. I would liked to have rated this higher. When I got it, I was so happy. It was beautiful. Much better than the picture. But, I guess it's still nice. <end>  Nice necklace  Ordered for a soon-to-be 13 year old girl that wants to be an Egyptologist. Have not given it to her yet, but I think she will love it. It is a nice looking necklace. <end>
 B0006OJ524  Nordic Magician Runic Pentagram Pentacle Crystal Pendant Necklace ||	  Its Not Easy Being Green...  I would like to start off by saying that this product got to me incredibly quickly, and I was delighted with the shipping and packaging. The pendant is pretty, although the mold used for the pentagram is probably a copy of another mold, as the detail of the runes is quite thick and sloppy.The chain, as mentioned in other reviews, is cheap, but so is the pendant! Both items turn my skin green, so I would recommend buying some clear nail polish and coating the back of the pendant before wearing it. As for the chain... it is pretty much beyond saving. It is thick, masculine, and in my opinion rather ugly. Still, this pendant is not all bad! <end>  Gorgeous item, great seller!  Wonderful seller!! I ordered the necklace at the same time as another item which I'd paid to have express shipped - and this came first! Was well-packaged and well-presented. The pendant was absolutely beautiful, and I can't wait to wear it. My only complaint was the chain - it seemed a bit too big for the pendant, but I'll just buy a good chain and put the pendant on it - an easy fix. Thank you!! <end>  mixed feelings.  I ordered this item a while ago. it got to me in a reasonably timely manner, so I have no complaints about THAT.shipping costs were pretty high.the Pendant itself is GORGEOUS, but the chain is cheap and tacky. I'm going to have to purchase a sterling silver chain that will compliment the Pendant, without turning brown. but I really wanted the Pendant. so I'll get another chain that won't tarnish, but will show it off.actually, they would have been better off to sell the Pendant without a chain. <end>  Beautiful, but Flawed.  The pendant is gorgeous...I couldn't be happier with it. However, the clasp on the chain came to me broken---so I can't wear it until I've replaced the chain. Kind of a bummer. I feel that the broken clasp was something that should have been inspected before it was sent to me. I would still suggest people order this item, because the chain I got probably was a freak occurance...all of the other jewerly I've gotten from this company has been flawless. <end>
 B0006OJ6GO  Sterling Silver Turquoise Wide Armor Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  Still going after 2+ years  Bought this as a gift for my sister two years ago for Christmas. She wears it almost daily and it's still in fine shape. <end>  Poor quality  This is a very flimsy and breakable peice of jewlery...you could not tell from the photo. <end>
 B0006OJ73G  Sterling Silver Happy Sun Poison Locket Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Too Small  The ring is too small for most pills, but is OK for other uses. It is not for a man <end>
 B0006OJ740  Sterling Silver Elephant Spinning Spin Band Ring Size 7(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  fantastic "fiddle" ring  I bought this ring after reading that spinner rings had helped others finally stop biting their nails. I've always heard that one habit would have to be replaced by another; a likely key to past failed attempts.This ring has surpassed my expectations. I leave it on day and night including showers and hand washing. It still looks great and hasn't tarnished a bit. I just ordered additional ones for a friend and for my daughter.This ring is wider than what I usually wear, so I'd advise ordering one size larger than you normally wear. <end>  Just as advertised  Exactly what I wanted in a spinner ring. Detail is true to picture and the spinner spins freely. I like that it is a bit narrower than most spinner rings. <end>
 B0006OJ786  Engraveable Poison Sterling Silver Ring size 8.5 ||	  perfect.  When I recieved the ring in the mail I was not disappointed at all. It was in perfect condition, fit good, the clasp opened wonderfully and had beautiful detailing on it. <end>  Fabulous!  The ring is beautiful! Exactly what I expected - and more! Shipping was great! Would definitely purchase again! Thank you! <end>
 B0006OMQD4  Sterling Silver Flat Beach Hermit Crab Pendant or Charm ||	  Adorable!!!  It's hard to believe a crab could be so cute, but this one definitely is. Wore it the same day I received it and got some compliments. A little bit heavier than some of my other charms, but with a stronger necklace (box chain is my preference) it shouldn't be a problem. I wanted a crab necklace and chose this one because of the way the claws were positioned. They looked like they wouldn't catch on any clothing because the top ones are attached and the bottom two are curved inwards. I think the tiny eyes on top make it look a little more comical. Hopefully on a day when I'm feeling crabby (poor pun ) this will cheer me up. Overall, great charm! <end>  AWESOME!  i LOVE my charm! it was exactly what i wanted---arrived beautifully and un-harmed....quick delievery! <end>
 B0006OT8YO  Sterling Silver Red Garnet Wing Butterfly Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8) ||	  Excellent Quality  I ordered this ring for my daughter's birthday and I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The detailing is excellent and it is a very pretty, very classy looking ring. The tiny antennae add just the right touch, and the stones are a nice shade of red. I liked the ring so much that I am going to order one for myself. I think that if you like the picture, you will absolutely love this ring when you see it! >^..^&lt; <end>  it is cute  It is a very cute ring. I liked it a lot. I only think im not so satisfy its a little bit too raised. have to be carefull it catches on to your clothes when you are dressing. A little bit too girly, The colors are great. <end>  Perfect!  I heard a quote the other day that went..."and just when life seemed surely over, the caterpillar turned into a beautiful butterfly" I'm in the process of divorce right now. Its been really hard. And there have been times that "life seemed surly over" So when I heard that quote...I thought THAT'S ME! I am just in the process of turning into a butterfly! I decided I wanted something to remind me of that quote when things got tough... And this was it! I love it...its perfect!! I looked a lot of places, but I wear a size 4 and they are hard to find. This ring is beautiful, and they were very prompt with shipping. I would highly recommend them.  ) <end>
 B0006Q3Q4A  Anklet - A61 - Stretch - Crystal and Heishi Beads ~ Clear AB (Iridescent) ||	  Beautiful!!!  This is the prettiest anklet I have ever seen!! Who needs expensive diamonds when you can have sparkling crystals like theses. I immedately ordered a necklace to go with it and cant wait to order more!! As always love Amazon!! <end>  A must  An anklet can be a sexy addition to your wardrobe, drawing the eye to your footwear, and giving that hint of the exotic. This crystal and bead anklet provides a nice combination of subtlety and provocativeness. With its pretty coloring, this anklet looks excellent with both sandals and bare feet.Ladies, during those intimate moments, when less clothing is the name of the game, jewelry comes into its own, and nice anklets (such as these) are a must!(Review of STRETCH CRYSTAL & HEISHI BEAD ANKLET CLEAR AB) <end>  GORGEOUS  I just received my anklet today. It is beautiful, to say the least. I have looked for anklets in stores at the mall and no one ever seems to have any. The one or two I've seen were rather child-like looking. Of course, I finally get the bright idea of looking on Amazon - and they never fail to have just what I want. I never ordered from Serenity Crystals before, but they shipped the anklet the same day I placed my order and I had it 4 days later, including the weekend! I never would have found anything close to this for what I paid online, even with shipping fees. This is a great price for a beautiful anklet. <end>  Lasted Only A Few Days  The crystals were very pretty, and I loved it on my ankle and the ease of getting it on and off; however, it caught slightly on a chair and broke instantly, so caution is needed when wearing. <end>  Good Stuff from Amazon  The Swarovski crystal with Heishi beads is beautiful and my fiance loves it. Delivered as promised. I am a huge Amazon online fan. <end>  Great gift for the Girlfriend  I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it to death. It looks great and will fit almost any ankle size. Would buy a second one in case the first one breaks. All in All was a great buy. <end>  anklet  This anklet was a good fit. Just enough stretch. Nice sparkle. I would buy it again. <end>  pretty but broke after two days when i was taking my pants off!  i liked it when it came but did not last. u need to be very careful with it if you want it to last <end>  bling!  This ankle bracelet looks better in person than in the picture! The crystals are awesome and I love that it is stretchy. Dresses up an outfit perfectly  ) <end>  Not too happy about the stretch material  At first I loved the anklet but after a few weeks the stretch seemed to be getting looser and looser. I have another one that has a clasp and it is alot better. <end>  Ankle bracelet  I love the look of the ankle bracelet just wish it was made with chain instead of an elastic band. I am so afraid it will break. IT is beautiful!! <end>
 B0006Q3Q4K  Anklet - A64 - Stretch - 4mm Swarovski (tm) Crystal and Heishi Beads ~ Hematite ||	  Not Magnetic Hematite  I was wanting to buy a hematite bracelet to see if it would really help with my health. Hey. Don't laugh. I'm willing to try anything at this point. lol. Some people actually believe it works. Anywho, back on track. It's not hematite. I am still going to keep it because it is pretty and fits nicely. But if you want a hematite bracelet/anklet, this is not it. <end>
 B0006Q3Q54  Anklet - A65 - Stretch - Crystal and Heishi Beads ~ Jet Black ||	  Pretty anklet  This anklet is very pretty and the description matches the product. However, it does not stretch as much as I had hoped. I got it in the largest size, which is an 11. I like anklets that I can just slip on and off. I don't want to fuss with a clasp. I am of average weight, but seem to need larger size anklets and was hoping this one had more give. I can't wear in on my ankle as it is too tight, but wear it on my wrist, like a bracelet. It is too big for my wrist, but I wear it with several other bracelets, which keeps it from falling off. The crystals sparkle and the black beads look very fancy with the crystals. I will keep looking for a stretchy, pull on anklet for this summer. The product was shipped very quickly and packaged very carefully. I will look for more products from this seller that will meet my needs. <end>  Love it  Great selection of all types jewelry. I love the stretch ankelet. So much easier to put on than the typical anklets. I will be shopping this site again. <end>  Love it.  I bought this before but I broke it, so this is my second one. I like because it fits over my boots. I bought the smaller version for my ankle to wear with sandals.I wish they came in more colors. <end>
 B0006SE0SO  Sterling Silver Amethyst Mystical Armor Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  COMFORT IS THE NAME OF THE GAME  COMFORT IS THE RIGHT WORD TO USE WHEN TALKING ABOUT THIS RING; NOT TO MENTION THAT IT LOOKS SO BOHO--LOVE THAT LOOK. AGAIN, THIS IS FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE SELLERS. THANKS SO MUCH REGARDS,DH <end>  Regret  I was shocked when I saw this ring, it was not what I expected. I have never seen a ring so small, not made for humans. it's something I'd expect in a bon bon at Christmas time.It's too tight for my pinky, the sizing is all wrong.I can't imagine them selling this item in a jewelry shop, very disappointing, not worth the money at all. I won't buy jewelry online anymore.A regret <end>
 B0006SE2SM  Sterling Silver AMETHYST Armour Ring Size 7.5 ||	  Ring arrived as described - love it  I love amethyst and this ring was exactly as described/pictured. I wear it often. I feel this ring needs to be cleaned on a regular basis because it tarnishes but I clean all my silver jewelry on a regular basis for the same reason. I put this ring on my Amazon Wish List and received it as a gift. I really like it! It fits because I know my ring size so make sure you know your size before ordering. This company has an excellent return policy so if you get your size wrong, you can always exchange it for the right size with minimal hassle. Great customer service. I've bought from this company before and always had a good experience. <end>  Very Nice Ring, I like It.  Very Beautifull Ring and nice design, i bought this armor ring and it is same as on the Picture,now i have a set, Thank you again. <end>
 B0006SEQ10  Sterling Silver AMETHYST Eternity Band Ring Sz 6.5 ||	  Poor quality. Stones fell out often.  Stones fell out of this ring. The company did replace it for my daughter. I don't think she kept contacting them each time though. Not good quality, but very pretty. <end>
 B0006SJQA6  Sterling Silver Happy Sun Poison Locket Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Too Small  The ring is too small for most pills, but is OK for other uses. It is not for a man <end>
 B0006SJRQE  Sterling Silver Joan of Arc Lady Warrior Armor Ring Size 10(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13) ||	  Pretty But Tight Fit  This ring is very beautiful, but it didn't fit my finger comfortably so I returned it. It also covers the bottom of your finger. If you are not used to wearing rings like that it might feel overwhelming. Silver Insanity provides incredible customer service and communication, a great seller. <end>  Beautiful  I ordered this ring for myself and am so pleased with it. I have large fingers and thought this ring might be a little overwhelming, but it looks great and fits comfortably, even on bigger fingers. You don't even need any other ring on your hand if you're wearing this one. It's wonderful. Silver insanity is the place to buy from if you want great jewelry at great prices with speedy service. <end>  Joan of Arc Ring Cool  This is awesome-but it is large (as in wide) and will take up whole ring area of finger,so if you want to wear other rings you will be unable to on the finger you wear this.However,the ring is beautiful ,well-made, and unique. I bought it for myself and highly recommend Silver Insanity products. <end>  Please make more!  This was my absolute favorite ring! I wore it everyday for more than two years until it was stolen from my locker at work. I would get compliments on it all the time and now I feel naked without it! The person who gave it to me purchased it here and I want to order a new one so bad! PLEASE make more!! <end>  Excellent quality as always  I have ordered several rings from Silver Insantity, and have never been disappointed in either the price or the quality. I will continue to order from this Seller. <end>  So Unique!  This ring is so beautiful and unique that complete strangers will stop me and ask me where I got it and I usually end up giving it to them....I have ordered five of these rings over the last couple of years, this time I believe I will really keep it! <end>  Awesome  I love this ring! I have really small hands so I was afraid it would be too big but it fits just right. Looks much better than the picture and I get compliments on it all the time. Would definitely recommend it. <end>
 B0006SW2MA  Surgical Steel Flat 8mm Wedding Band Ring laser Etched Tribal Design, sizes 7 - 14 ||	  badass  its a really awsome ring great price,looks sweet,its thick good weight to it. anybody can wear it but looks good for the guys <end>  Looks awesome, runs a bit small  I bought this ring because it looks seriously awesome. It got here, and it looks even better in person. Only issue I have is that it runs a bit small. I normally wear a size 11 ring, and I have to exchange it for a 12. Other than that, its a killer ring. <end>  steel ring  was kind of disappointed with this ring. did not really look like the picture. steel is not shiny like silver, ring has a dull finish. will not purchase like products in the future. <end>  excellent ring  Awesome ring, great quality, fits amazing. Delivered right on time, great price, would continue to but from seller. <end>  My ring  I really like my ring, and it actually showed up earlier than planned! <end>
 B0006TK3S4  Egyptian Silver Snake Arm Band ||	  silver arm bracelet  Well made, real silver, snake design made in Egypt. Has authentic feel and look. Nice weight for the price.I bought it for my wife who has well toned arms. I think it looks funky and hot with a tank top. <end>
 B0006TK3SE  Egyptian Silver Ankh Cuff Bracelet ||	  Beautiful  I love this bracelet. It's my favorite piece of jewelry I own. Very comfortable, doesn't fall off, doesn't turn your skin green, and is just lovely. Worth the money - I'm almost tempted to buy another one for my other wrist! =D <end>  Love the Bracelet  My husband got this me for a birthday present that I requested. I haven't worn it yet, but I have seen it several times and have placed it back in the cloth bag for a special occasion. Love it and now I'm wishing to find a ring to match. Thank You! <end>
 B0006TTA6A  Solitaire CZ Band .925 Sterling Silver Ring Size 9 ||	  not as pictured  i bought this ring and was surprised that it is not as pictured. no filagree work and stone is turned in opposite direction. otherwise okay, but was disappointed. <end>  Big Pink Ice!  That is exactly what this large princess cut stone looks like - a big chunk of pink ice.Due to the size, the color saturation is both even and fantastic. The setting is very sturdy. It makes an excellent ring for your larger fingers. Thanks. <end>
 B0006TUS8O  Sterling Silver Marcasite Royal Crown Band Ring Size 9 ||	  A royal beauty =]  Very satisfied with this amazing ring! it's just too cute and sparkles a lot!..buy it and you won't regret. <end>  SHE LOVES IT!!!  The queen of my castle has been wanting a ring like this ever since our Disney vacation. I gave this to her for christmas, and she absolutely loves it. The photo does not do it justice, as it is a very nice piece of jewelry. It arrived sooner than expected, and the gift box is a really nice touch. Gentlemen, take my advice and get this ring for your queen or princess and you will truly be the King of your castle! <end>  beautiful and well-made!  I really like this ring and have gotten compliments on it - the price is reasonable too. Good quality. <end>  Darling ring  I bought this for a gift for a dear friend. The friend (who competes in beauty pageants) can not stop talking about it. She is a young lady, about 16, and she absolutely adores the rings. It's a beautiful ring. Very nicely made. I'm so glad I found it.Great gift for any young girl. <end>  Amazing!  This is a great ring! I got it very quickly and it is shinier and prettier than the picture. I plan on getting another one. <end>  Love this ring!  I absolutely love this ring! It is so different. Very pretty and feminine and it has a dazzling sparkle to it. I am thinking of ordering another one in case this one gets lost! You won't be disappointed with this little gem. <end>  Buy this ring!!  I am always leary of buying jewelery online, but i'll tell you what, I love this ring! I got it this afternoon, and have no intention of taking it off! The shipping was lightning fast (I ordered it on a Thursday, had it Monday!!) and this ring is beautiful!!!This ring is not large, it's very dainty, and just lovely!!I'll look forward to ordering more products from this seller!!Buy the ring, you won't be sorry!! <end>  Unique and beautiful  I wanted something a little unique and this was perfect. It is very shiny and stands out, it has a good weight and the size was just right.As an addition, it came in a cute little box. <end>  Nice at triple the price  Bought at Christmas as a present, I was very happy with the very quick shipping, the well padded packing, and the quality of the ring- all at very inexpensive pricing. I highly recommend this. <end>  QUALITY RING  I ordered this ring as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loved it! You can't tell from the picture, but it isn't a cheap, lightwieght ring. It's a nice quality ring. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I'm a collector of marcasite jewelry and I love this ring. It is probably the most unique and interesting marcasite ring I own and what an amazing price (please note that I bought this when it was less than $20). My daughter bought this for me and now wants one for herself. I've received many compliments on it already. If you love marcasite, you will not be disappointed and you definitely cannot beat the price. <end>  beautiful item  This crown-shaped ring is pretty and fun. It's brighter and shinier than it seems in the photo and is just right for those who like their rings with some thematic flair.It comes in a nice gift box. Great presentation! <end>  LOVE this ring!  I ordered this ring for my Daughter for her birthday. As soon as I received it, I knew that she was going to love it and I wished that I would have ordered one for myself. This picture doesn't do the ring justice! It really is a beautiful ring and honestly looks like it cost a whole lot more. My Daughter has received tons of compliments and I can't say that I'm surprised. Great ring! <end>  Never Take It Off  )  Love this ring! I never take it off! It's so beautiful! Everyone complements it that I see. I've been waiting a crown ring forever, and this is the perfect one! I ordered a size 7.5 on accident. I needed a size 9. But I contacted the seller and they fixed it quick and I got my size 9 ring in the mail. It's my favorite ring I've ever owned! It's awesome! &lt;3 <end>  Beautiful Ring  I got this ring because I thought it was an absolute beautiful piece. It is very unique, you don't see them around much. The only problem i have with it is, I have curly hair and the crown part of the ring tends to get stuck in my hair. But I don't mind I'm used to that already. All in all, the ring is beautiful and I recommend it to anyone. <end>  wheeeeewww  i love the way it fits!! its unexpensive piece of a jewerly, it looks expensier than what i paid for!! <end>  More beautiful in person  Many pieces of jewelry look OK in the photos and your not really sure what it will look like when you get it. This one was brilliant when it arrived. Without diamonds you usually don;t get this much sparkle. I often bead jewelry so I sometimes like to have other things to fill out the style and look.This is a crazy fun piece for a man it makes people look at you different. <end>  Compliments EVERYWHERE!  I didn't buy this ring myself; I received it as a birthday gift for my 21st from my best friend. It is an absolutely gorgeous ring, and it is very well made. Don't wear this ring if you're extremely shy, lol! It doesn't matter where I wear it; I get compliments from EVERYONE. One lady even took my hand so she could get a closer look. <end>  It's just lovely~!  I love this ring.When I purchased it, honestly, I did not much expect about this, but when I putted it on my finger, I just loved it.People notice this ring and they say it looks really good. No matter how old they are, they say same thing that this ring is quite unique and beautiful. I am planning to buy one more for my another hand. (Currently I am wearing this on my right hand, so I will get one more for my left hand.) <end>  Awesome  I love this ring! I have a good sized collection of rings, and this one is still my favorite after having it for several months. It is delicate and not too sparkly. It may seem to intense from the images, but trust me, the whimsical quality is not to be missed. <end>
 B0006U6IJG  Italian Charms Laser I Love My Boys ||	  I love my boys  I gave this to my daughter-in-law to add to her bracelet I started a few years ago. She loves it. <end>  LOVE IT  This was a great addition to my charm bracelet. Looks great and lets everybody know I have sons! <end>
 B0006U6ISW  Italian Charms Laser Life Begins At 40 ||	  body candy never came  I ordered this body candy Italian charm Life Begins at 40 for a surprise party for my son. Well the surprise was on me. The envelope arrived the day before the party and it was empty! I wanted to get the money back but they were closed when I called and I just gave up. DO not order this item. <end>
 B0006U7SOU  Crystal Bracelet Sterling Silver Multicolor Crystal 7.5 inch Bracelet With Toggle Clasp Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Lovely bracelet!  Got this as an anniversary gift (thanks sweetie) and it's lovely! Crystals are made of plastic so they're very lightweight and reflect hundreds of mini-rainbows at the right angle of light. Being multi-color means it goes with everything! <end>  my wifes birthday present  i was very pleased with this bracelet,it was very pretty and of very good quality ,my wife is thrilled with it ,i would not hesitate to recommend others to buy it ,john <end>  colorful  bought it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved the colorful stones.Great product <end>  Wonderful gift  I bought this gift for my wife for Christmas. She was delighted with it (she especially likes the toggle clasp, so it is easy to take on and off). I also bought the matching necklace and earrings -- they make a great set. The colors of the crystals are quite vivid. <end>  Beautiful  Great wear. All products I ordered from this s4eller arrived ahead of time. Fantastic price for lovely jewlery. Very happy. <end>  gorgeous  I bought the bracelet, earrings and necklace together. They are beautiful! I have received so many compliments. The pictures do not do the jewelry justice. <end>  Not Worth It!!!  This bracelet is not worth it!!I usually never leave comments, but when i saw the price for such a simple bracelet i had to say my opinion!If it actually took talent to make this bracelet, then yea i would say you should pay 40 bucks for it. But it doesnt! All it is, is random colorful beads through wire, there is no weaving or color scheme to this at all. Those beads are even cheap. I make bracelets all the time and i actually use a pattern and have to weave through to make a beautiful work of art. Please if you want something like this just go to a bead store and buy what you need there! It will save you $10 and you can make it your own!! <end>  WONDERFUL GIFT  MY HUSBAND BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BIRTHDAY. EVERYTIME I WEAR IT, I GET COMPLIMENTS. I LOVE IT. <end>  Lovely!  It's even nicer than the picture. I'm thrilled with my bracelet. Lots of compliments. So many times you order an item and it doesn't live up to its description. This is one of the exceptions. It's beautiful. <end>  great gift  I purchased this as a gift for my college age daughter and she loved it. Great quality, beautiful colors and lots of sparkle. <end>  Lots of bling for the buck  I purchased this bracelet for myself along with matching earrings and was thoroughly amazed with the quality and color of the stones. I had been looking for multi color pieces and have found exactly what I wanted with this purchase. I certainly will buy more pieces of jewelry. I have never been disappointed with anything purchased through Amazon. <end>  Beautifully eyecatching.  Received this lovely bracelet along with matching earrings and love them. They sparkle alot and outside the colors are brillant! Every color of the rainbow and then some. I get complements each time I wear this beautiful jewery and it simply makes me feel pretty. My niece will be given a set in the blue and lavender hues for her bithday. I am sure she will be as overjoyed as I was. <end>  gorgeous bracelet!!!  This bracelet is more beautiful than the picture. I loved it so much I ordered the crystal ankle bracelet to match. I receive so many compliments on this bracelet, and it goes with every outfit because of all of the colors.Gem Avenue are a pleasure to deal with, I had to exchange the bracelet for a larger one and they did it with no problem and promptly.I will order from them again with no hesitation for gifts in the future.Every item is beautiful and reasonably priced! <end>  Drop Dead gorgeous but too short...  I ordered two sets, the lanvender and the multi, both earrings and bracelet. They are absolutely beautiful, even more than the picture. The only complaint is that the bracelet is too short. I am going to have to see if I can exchange of a slighty larger size. Because of the size if the stones, it is not a "TRUE" 7.5 inch in fit. <end>  Gorgeous Bracelet  I bought this a few months ago, and I wear it almost daily. It matches EVERYTHING, and I always receive compliments on this bracelet. The only downside is that I work at a computer for 12-hours a day, and sometimes the pointy parts of the crystals dig into my arm. Nothing that a little shake of the arm to adjust the bracelet can't fix though. Definitely a must-buy! <end>  Lovely accessory for any outfit  I ordered this item as a gift, but once it arrived I decided to keep it for myself. The colors are lovely and compliment any outfit, casual or dressy. It is also easy to put on. Highly recommend! <end>  Multi-Color Swarovski Crystal Bracelet  My third purchase from Gem Avenue - my wife loved a Swarovski Crystal necklace/earing set I bought for Valentine's, so I picked this out for her. She loved it too from the second she opened the box. The crystals really sparkle and draw everyone's attention. She was comparing them to some colored CZs she has, and she said the crystals were more brilliant and eye-catching. I think for the price it's a good bet for nice costume jewelry piece. <end>  Beautiful bracelet  I bought this as a present for my 20 year old niece. It is really nice - much more beautiful in person than the picture shows! She really loves it and the crystals just sparkle. <end>  multi color crystal bracelet  I love this bracelet. It is so colorful an cheery. Goes great with the matching earings, rings and necklace. I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Nice  -)  The necklace is lovely  -) I also got the matching earrings & Bracelet.It's not heavy @ all very lite. All are so shiny... I had the set on just the other day and got compliments on both. I'm glad I order them...I'm very happy & pleased. <end>  its awesome for the price  omg yeah its great, I love the way it sparkles, its really sparklie, it almost mesmerizes you its so nice. People make comments all the time about it, and wonder where and how much it costs. its just gorgeous. It consists of smaller gems on the sides and in the middle larger ones, to make it look like the centerpiece its so nice! <end>  Pretty!  Have purchased several of the swarovski items in this style, and have loved them all. The colors are beautiful, and the people that have received them as gifts love them too! <end>  Absolutely beautiful!  I love everything swarovski and usually buy my jewelry directly from them but it does get a bit expensive. Then I found this vendor on Amazon and after reading the reviews, I decided to give them a try and order a bracelet. Actually I ordered two. That was on Thursday, 4/29 and I got them TODAY, Tuesday, 5/4. It looked exactly as the picture and I don't find the crystals too large or gawdy at all. I don't know what that other reviewer was talking about. Usually they would be a lot smaller than depicted on a picture but this one was exact. The size fits. I have an average wrist and the bracelet is the perfect size for me. That was mostly what I was worried about. But no problem. It was easy to fasten, not to tight...I hardly notice it on at all. It doesn't move, stays in place. And oh what sparkle! I'm definitely going to order another color before they raise the price! Buy it, you won't be disappointed and it came in 4 business days from the East coast to the west coast with free shipping! Usually with free shipping it takes a lot longer because they ship it the cheapest way possible but not these people. I AM DEFINITELY MAKING ANOTHER PURCHASE. <end>  I bought this twice for my girlfriend (after I lost it the first time)  It is a nice bracelet. My girlfriend (now fiancee) loved it! Not bad for the price. I would recommend buying this product as a surprise gift. <end>  Amazing!  I have ordered bracelets before but was so amazed at the quality and sparkle of this beautiful, reasonable priced bracelet. I would recommend this purchase to anyone who loves crystals! <end>  Love It  Got this for my mom and she wears it all the time  ). It's really shiny and could possibly suit anyone's taste <end>  Very disappointed  Trinket that is worthless. Looks like a plastic trinket that should go for 99 cents. Useless product. I am disappointed. <end>  Just great!  It's a really nice bracelet and even better than the picture. Very vivid colous and you can wear it with almost everything! Great purchase! <end>  Teen Dream  I bought this bracelet for my over 50 sister, who loves a little bling, and Swarovski crystals are sparkly and beautiful. I was so disappointed to open the box and find a bracelet full of plastic beads! Very fashionable for a teen or young adult, but not at all what I'd expect for an older, more mature, adult. <end>  Better than I thought  I bought this bracelet for my wife for our anniversary. The photo doesn't do it justice. It's absolutely dazzling. It has such sparkle and shine. My wife got several compliments from our waitress at a restaurant we went to. It's a great buy! <end>  All I can say is WOW!  I bought this bracelet for my wife for Christmas. She LOVES it. The crystals really sparkle and she has gotten several compliments on it already. She loves the fact that it can be worn casual or can be worn when she is dressed up. The colors are beautiful! <end>  Cute and sparkly  The bracelet is indeed cute. The reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is because in the picture, the bracelet appears to be equally thick throughout its length, but when I got I saw that it has slightly bigger crystals in the middle, while those closer to the two endings (clasp) are smaller. Still very cute, just a little different that what I imagined based on the picture. Overall a nice purchase, fun and sparkly. <end>  Very Pretty  I was a little skeptical when I ordered the bracelet without actually seeing it but was pleasently surprised at how pretty it really is. I was impressed both by the product and their speedy delivey. <end>  Beautiful Bracelet  The bracelet is more beautiful than the picture shows.Very pretty pastel colors. A great spring and summer bracelet.The quality seems quite good.I highly recommend this product. <end>  Amazing bracelet!  I ordered this bracelet, and I LOVE IT. It is very pretty.

My wife gets plenty of compliments when she wears it. <end>

 B0006V4AJ0  Crystalline Gem Hollow Heart Trio Dangle Belly Ring ||	  I would say no  this looks really nice online...i know....but the belly ring is HUGE( it was so long it touched my pants when i sat down. and i dont recommend this for someone with a new piercing because it is a little heavy. plus, the hearts break off easily. but it looks cute(just cuter on the net trust me) <end>

 B0006V4B9O  Black Jeweled CASINO DICE Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Black Dice Belly Ring  This is a pretty good design and it doesn't hang too far down. After a couple weeks though the dice did actually come loose and I had to superglue the dice back onto the bar. Other than that it is very pretty and I like the little sparkles on the dice. <end>
 B0006V4BTY  Midnight Gem SNOW PENGUIN Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Way more than expected  I bought this for my Girlfriend as a fake gift to arrive a day before her real gift (a really nice watch). She loves penguins but looking at this it seems a bit corny and childish. Well it is not. She loves this belly button ring so much its awesome. If you don't like penguins don't get it because that the main allure here. It's very cute and she says its very good quality. its dangley but not very much so its quite comfortable to wear. <end>  Cutest belly button ring!  This belly button ring is perfect. I was worried that the dangling penguin would either get caught on my clothes, or get squished just from normal day-to-day activities that it would break off, but I've had it in 24/7 for a couples months now with no problems. I love penguins and this belly button ring is just absolutely perfect! Even the shipping was quick! <end>

 B00074DO48  14k White Gold Diamond Accent Large Oval Pav? Hoop Earrings ||	  Beware  This item looks better on the internet than it does in person. The earrings are small and the diamons are CLOUDY! I sent them back the moment I opened the box. I never ordered jewlery from the internet and I never will again. <end>  how amazon or macy's ruined christmas  Well first of all I was satisfied with the product dont get me wrong.The thing that went totally wrong was the shipping method that was used by who ever shipped it. Or may be it was UPS who messed up. I dont know who messed up but the reason for my review is that someone did. This was a preasent for my girl friend. And in order for her not to find out about it I had it mailed to my P O Box. It was directed to my previous address which was then forwarded to my girl friend. She got her christmas present two weeks early. That totally sucked I did not have anything to surprise her Christmas morning. <end>

I ordered the item on a Saturday and it was here on Tuesday; packaged in a nice box, with a jewelery pounch as well. I would recommend this seller/company to others. <end>  Great piece of culture.

Amazon made it easy. <end>  18k Gold with Lapis Scarab Pendant  Lapis Scarab...bought this for grown granddaughter who loves things that are different...she had seen a scarab a few months ago and wanted that one, but coulnd't afford it...I love it..delicate and very good craftsmanship,,,Looking forward to her seeing it and her reaction...karen <end>
 B000765Y3K  14k White Gold Classic Solitaire Engagement Ring Setting ||	  Pretty  As a former jeweler's assistant, I fell in love with pretty from day one. I love my ring. It is not perfect, but, as any jeweler will tell you, there's no such thing as perfect when it comes to the real thing. (By the way, one can say that about people, too!) <end>

 B00076QG32  Sterling Silver Pink Crystal 1mm Omega Chain Necklace Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Satisfied Bride  I purchased 5 of these for my bridesmaids. The chain is very good quality, and sturdy silver. The crystal cluster is also very nice and held together with clear, sturdy string. They come separated for you to put together yourself, which could allow for you to use the chain for mulitple charms. This also allows the cluster to slide along the chain, and it's inserted per gaps allowed in the center of each side of the cluster. The cluster is also larger than it looks on the website, and is a good size. This still worked for me since my girls are wearing strapless dresses, though. I would recommend this necklace, but be sure you aren't looking for something very small and simple for an already busy outfit. The different colors in the cluster are also very nice, so the pink isn't too strong. <end>  Beautiful Sparkle!  [[ASIN B00076QG32 Austrian Pink Swarovski Crystal Slide with 1 MM Italian Omega Sterling Silver Chain 14" 16" 18" 20" 22" 24" Necklace]. This necklace is perfect for a formal, dressy outfit or for a more casual outfit. It is just the right size to go with anything to add a bit of brillant sparkle. I like the size of the crystal beads, not too large and not too small. This necklace looks like it should cost more. I bought the 22" and have gotten many compliments about it. I also bought the matching bracelet. I have actually planned to wear certain clothes just so I can wear these! <end>
 B00076QG3C  Sterling Silver Blue and Clear Crystal 1mm Omega Chain Necklace Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Crystal and Chain are great  This product is excatly as it is advertised. The crystal is a ball shape - and slides nicely onto the chain and catches the light quite nicely. I am not sure that if it was a flat backed item it would do as well. The chain is exactly what I was looking for as I now use it for not just this slide but others as well. The length is great - it is easy to put on (when you have fingernails!) and both have gotten many compliments. <end>  the crystal is ball-shaped and too big  The crystal pendant is a ball, instead of a slice, which makes it a little uncomfortable to wear. <end>
 B00076VRT0  SCBR008 Sterling Silver Austrian Clear AB Crystal Bracelet 7.5 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Expensive  It is a nice bracelet, although it looks a little bit on the cheap side. I really think it is overpriced. <end>  picture perfect but.....  the picture looks stunning that's why I bought it for my Mom's birthday. the crystals look great but i am disappointed with the silver component of this bracelet coz it looks like polished aluminum. ideal for evening wear to highlight the crystals & not bring attention to the silver. <end>  Great Bracelet  This is a very pretty bracelet.It really catches the lights and shines like crazy.I'm not usually big on bracelets but this is one I really will wear. It is also very comfortable wearing. Some bracelets are not.I am as always very happy with the timely shipping of Gem Ave. <end>  very pretty, but not perfect  When I received this bracelet I was overwhelmed by the sparkle. It is so pretty on. The light catches every facet. The only 2 problems I have is that the bracelet turns when on my wrist so that the crystals are facing down. Also, I am not the crazy about the silver toggle as it looks cheap. However, for the price, it is worth it. <end>  Great Bracelet  This is a pretty bracelet. It catches your eye and the eyes of other people. It never looks exactly the same, b/c of the way the light hits it. And it looks good with pale or tan skin- b/c I have been both during the time I have had the bracelet.My mom loves it, too- she asks to borrow it so much, that I am giving her one for a gift. Defintely buy- it is a good deal! <end>  One beautiful bracelet!!  I am so pleased with this bracelet! It has a nice weight to it and is so easy to put on. The crystals have a great cut that really captures the light. It puts on such a light show. I have had quite a few compliments on it and is the perfect size. Shipped quickly and worth every penny. A must have for any girl. <end>  Sparkly - WOW  This is a most unusual bracelet, haven't found anything like it in the stores in my area. It glitters and sparkles when the light hits it.The toggle clasp is handy and easy to put on. Have had a lot of compliments on it already. If you're a jewelry lover like me it is a must. <end>  Beautiful  Its very beautiful, the shine and cut are excellent. I have had more compliments on it then any other piece I wear. I love wearing it when I ride my motorcycle because when the sun hits it, its awesome! <end>  More Fire and Ice  Bought the earrings when I saw this I just had to order it. Again a product that lives up to t he Swarovski name. Everyone is envious <end>  Julie R Snyder " Queen Fan"  This is SUCH a gorgeous bracelet! I'm glad I ordered it for myself. <end>  stunningly simple  needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything; including great taste. she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry. i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it. it arrived promptly; in time for Christmas; and it is very stunning. not gaudy at all; just classic style beauty. could probably be worn to her office each day (upscale casual) or if she is dressed up. the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting. i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself; and i am not a huge jewelry fan. <end>  Stunning bracelet  When I received this bracelet I was absolutely knocked off my feet!! It is larger than it looks in the picture and is absolutely stunning. <end>  Couldn't be more pleased  I am so please with the quality and looks of my bracelet. The prompt service I received was also great. <end>  Pretty Bracelet  Pretty Bracelet, but looks cheap and phony up close. Picture looks better than actual product. Shipping from Gem Ave is Slowwww. <end>  Absolutely Stinkin' Beautiful!!  I was kind of worried when I read some of the other reviews for this, but I'm so glad I ordered it! It is sooooo much more beautiful in person than in the picture. It's wonderfully sparkly and just the right size. It did take a bit long to ship, but it was worth the wait. <end>  ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL  Very pleased with this bracelet. The crystals are gorgeous.It is a WOW bracelet! <end>  Beautiful  I ordered these for my bridesmaids to wear in the wedding and they were so sparkly and had the right accent to their dresses. <end>  Love It!  My boyfriend suprised me with this and I love it, It's really shinny but lil big for my rist thou but not to big wear it falls off just moves around my rist but not were it's annoying. <end>  Picture is misleading  They must use great photography because the picture looks NOTHING like what I recieved. The bracelet came completely tarnished and discolored. It doesn't even look silver, it's brown and rusty. The beads look a lot cheaper than what the picture shows. I was excited to buy this bracelet, but was completely let down when I opened the box. This was supposed to be a gift for someone and I am embarrassed to give it to her now. Sorry I wasted my money. <end>  Cute but...  This bracelet was part of 3 pieces my children bought me for Mother's Day. It's very sparkly and catches the eye. It is, however, bulky and awkward trying to do anything with it on. Typing/writing are pretty much out as it slides down and gets in the way. I love it, though. Recommend wearing it other than work. <end>

I called the company and the chain was replaced within 3 days without any hassles. The new chain was strong with a secure Italian lobster clasp. It had a lovely shine, without being "glaring" and artificial looking. It came in a small, wrappable gift box and will make a wonderful present paired with the silver pendant I have in mind. If it was possible to give a four and a half star rating on this product, I would have done it! <end>  Hey ! It's a nice Chain,  The title says it all.

It was a little longer than most reviews were suggesting, but I was also ordering into Canada. The shipment took a about a two weeks to arrive. <end>  silver rope  this is a very pretty rope chain.

The clasp is easy to use and durable. I would definitely order again from this company in the future. <end>  love it  I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction. <end>  Very pretty necklace!  The Italian Sterling Silver necklace was more than I thought it would be. I wear it with my white gold pendants & you can't tell the difference. It has a lot of brillance & shine. I would recommend this necklace to anyone that doesn't want to pay the high price of a 24" gold necklace, you won't be disappointed. <end>  Sterling Silver Necklace  Received item very quickly and it is beautiful! Definitely would order from this vendor again in the future. <end>  recommend the silver necklass  The necklass was better than expected. Price was very, very reasonable. Arrived quickly. Very pleased. <end>  Wonderful necklace  All I can really say is that this is a very nice Sterling Silver chain. It has a nice weight to it. If your considering buying this item you will not be disappointed. <end>  Rope chain  Was very pleased to recieve this Beautiful rope chain at first.I ordered this chain for a friend, replacing a much thinner chain which always got tangled. Unfortunately he started getting a bad rash around his neck from this chain after a few weeks use.Be careful. <end>
 B00078MNQ4  Pugster 316l Surgical Steel Heart Red Clear Blue Swarovski Crystal Birthstone Crystal Cap Belly Button Ring Navel Piercing Body Jewelry ||	  A pretty brooch  A very pretty brooch that I wore to school as a visual to describe symmetry. One student even stated that she wanted to steal it. Definitely a lovely addition to my pin collection. <end>
 B000790K1I  Sterling Silver Baltic Amber Flaming Sun Pendant Necklace 18" ||	  Even more beautiful in person...  Do not judge this piece of jewlery by its poorly detailed photo because when I received it was so much more than I expected! The silver is very shiny and the amber gemstone is beautiful, and even adjusts it color by light and becomes a gorgeus honey-gold colour and looks great when you are out in the sunlight, especially if you wearing clothing of similar tones. So, this pendant is worth appreciating! <end>  Stunning  This is one of my most treasured pieces of jewelry. I received it as a gift last year after putting it on my Amazon.com wish list. I have received more compliments on this particular necklace than any other piece of jewelry I own. This is completely worth every penny. As the previous person said in their comment, this is much more beautiful in person. It goes with just about anything, and it is a major eye catcher. Wear this and you'll be center of attention. <end>  Pretty and Cute  I got this gift for my mom and she wore it for a week straight. She still likes it but it got misplaced. The quality is good. The actual pendant itself is the size of a dime its light weight and the rays are a bit pokey if you have a big chest. Other than that its youthful and I personally would wear it myself they had one that was more masculine. <end>  Beautiful piece  Gorgeous piece! I bought this for my wife, and she gets a lot of compliments on it. Fast hassle-free shipping as well. I always get great products from Silver Insanity. <end>  absolutely stunning!  everyone has commented on how gorgeous this necklace is! the craftsmans attention to detail combined with reasonable pricing makes this pendant a great gift, or purchase for oneself! <end>  Beautiful!  I purchased this item a few days ago. It was unbelievable how fast it was shipped. The necklace which exceeded my expectations was enclosed in a little velvet bag. I LOVE THIS NECKLACE! <end>
 B00079FVQW  Ring - R20 - Swarovski (tm) Crystal Stretch - Size Lg ~ Blue Zircon ||	  Very Nice  For the price of this ring I wasn't sure what I'd be getting...this ring is really quite pretty and very well made. <end>
 B00079RJ5I  Sterling Silver Heavy Men's Iron / Maltese Cross Ring 5/8 inch wide 16 mm wide ||	  Fantastic and heavy!  This is not a thin silver (i.e. cheaply made) ring. The price is SO good that I thought it would be really thin and cheap looking. I hesitated about buying it, but I'm so glad I did. The silver is thick and heavy, and the iron cross is large and masculine. It comes in really large, hard-to-find sizes for those larger guys...which is fantastic. For the price, you just can't beat it. It was an easy, no-brainer birthday gift to get my husband! <end>  don't hesitate  this is a nice heavy ring. not thin by any means, and not hollow. it looks great on your hand. clean design w/ minimal unpolished area between th e cross sections, which i think adds some character. nice ring <end>  Excellent  If one is considering the purchase of this ring, hesitate no longer. My Iron Cross ring arrived quickly, safely/well packaged, plus, the ring is even better than advertised. Sabrina Silver, thank you.JF <end>  Like a Rock  This is a solid piece of masculine jewellery. It has an impressive weight and price tag. The Maltese Cross is very symbolic, the symbolism goes back far past the Templar Knights. I recommend this ring. <end>  Nice Design...Poor Quality  Taking into account the rest of the reviews...I must've gotten a bad copy. The ring itself would be beautiful if it were cut or molded right. The points in the center don't line up. Also the sides of the cross aren't parallel. They are definitely slanted. Going to return this asap. For almost $80...I expected much better. <end>  Muy llamativo  Bastante llamativo. El &uacute;nico detalle fue que me quedo bastante grande y mas aun ahora que adelgace. Por este motivo no lo uso actualmente. <end>  Sterling silver men's Iron Cross Ring  This ring was exactly as it was described and arrived quickly. I'm very happy with this purchase and would buy from them again. <end>  Cross ring  This is a large solid ring. It looks just as advertised in the photo. The workmanship is good. This ring does not look cheap or cheesy. Everything I have bought from Sabrina shipped right away. <end>  Great ring, really worth every cent  Sabrina silver's ring is a real treat. At a very low price of $24, i have a feeling that if i smelt it and sell the silver chunk i would get my money back if all fails. Craftsmanship is not perfect, the four sides are not perfectly mathematically aligned, however that leaves a feeling of someone manually grinding and polishing the silver ingot to make this beautiful piece.The ring itself is big, i do not recommend it for the small hands as it will stand out too much (unless that is what you want), and you will get muscle-ache as you are lifting your arm/hand during the day.Ring sizing was perfect. Using Amazon's size helper i determined that my ring size is 12, and the ring fits perfectly. Just remember when you print Amazon's size helper to leave it unscaled!The only downside is that it took 32 days for the ring to be delivered to Europe, however i believe that delivery to USA destinations is much much faster. <end>  Fantastic piece of jewellery  This ring is gorgeous. Excellent value for money. Really heavy and masculine. A brilliant gift for heavy metal fans, hot-rodders and the like! <end>
 B00079UE7S  St. Patrick Rosary with Velvet St. Patrick Logo Box ||	  misrepresentation of product and damage of packaging  The rosary i ordered was close enough but i was HIGHLY disappointed in the green velvet box it came in. You advertised a box with the statement "St Patrick" on it, which is my fathers name. The box i ordered opened sideways and was inscribed. The box i received opened the wrong way and the company name was poorly written on the inside. The rosary didnt even hang right in the box. I was very excited about this gift for him and it completely ruined the ambience of the gift.Very disappointed.Also, the white box surrounding the velvet box was damaged and torn so it made the gift look cheap, which is was not, and it scratched the velvet.In future if you are going to advertise something pretty enough to catch someones eye, don't break their heart by smashing it in the wrong box, with the wrong inscription and no explanation <end>
 B00079UHI4  SCBR0013 Sterling Silver Lavender Blue and Clear Crystal Bracelet 7.5 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Disappointed  I bought this bracelet and the matching earrings as a Christmas gift and I REALLY wanted to like them. I was encouraged by all of the positive reviews and was looking forward to getting them in the mail. I was very surprised to find I didn't really like them when I opened them. I have other Swarovski jewelry and absolutely love it, the quality of the crystals look like really nice expensive gems. These look cheap. It does have some sparkle to it, but the colors are really muted and they almost look like plastic beads. Also, I have to agree with the reviewer who commented on the gradation of the crystals. The ones in the middle of the bracelet are significantly bigger and I think it would look much better if they were all the same size. The person I gave it to seemed to like it, so maybe it was just me (or maybe they were just trying to be nice). It's not very often I write negative reviews about anything, I was just so surprised that I didn't like this I felt like I had to share my opinion. <end>  Sparkle!  Every time I wear my bracelet, I get compliments. This is my favorite bracelet...the colors are beautiful. The crystals sparkle in any kind of light, especially in the sunlight. I would buy this bracelet again for a gift or if I find it in another color, would definitely buy again. Very nice bracelet! <end>  Lovely Sparkley Bracelet!  I though this bracelet would be primarily lavender colored, but I was delighted to find that it is mostly shades of blue. It has a toggle clasp, which is so much easier to deal with. It's very pretty and sparkley without looking cheap or tacky. If you wear lots of blue, you'll really like this bracelet! <end>  A big hit  I'm not always successful in picking jewelry on my own that my wife likes, and this was a big hit with her! I've bought several matching pieces . . . she loves them, I like them on her, and she gets a lot of compliments on them. Great service from this supplier, too! <end>  wedding party  Bracelets are definitely chunky, very sparkly. I ordered for my wedding party gifts to go with their dresses. Although the clasp looks a little on the cheap side, I am very happy with them and look forward to giving them to my girls! I also ordered one for myself! I asked some people at work what they thought I paid, it averaged in the $150-$200 range. They look great! <end>  looks VERY cheap  The pictures online look terrific and if it's Swarovski crystal it must be beautiful, right? WRONG! What a HUGE disappointment this was. I was embarrassed to give it as a gift because although it seemed like a bargain when I ordered it, what arrived would only please a little girl pretending to be an adult. Don't waste your money. <end>  Gorgeous bracelet!  First let me start by saying that I have lots of Swarovski jewelry. This is DEFINITELY not glass, it is indeed genuine Swarovski. This bracelet is absolutely sparkly and gorgeous. I'm wearing it right now.  ) I am very picky about my jewelry and cannot find one thing to complain about. I have the matching earrings and love those as well. <end>  Fabulous  Bought these for my bridesmaids & they were even MORE beautiful in person! great gifts <end>  Exactly what I expected  I love everything swarovski and usually buy my jewelry directly from them but it does get a bit expensive. Then I found this vendor on Amazon and after reading the reviews, I decided to give them a try and order a bracelet. Actually I ordered two. That was on Thursday, 4/29 and I got them TODAY, Tuesday, 5/4. It looked exactly as the picture and I don't find the crystals too large or gawdy at all. I don't know what that other reviewer was talking about. Usually they would be a lot smaller than depicted on a picture but this one was exact. The size fits. I have an average wrist and the bracelet is the perfect size for me. That was mostly what I was worried about. But no problem. It was easy to fasten, not to tight...I hardly notice it on at all. It doesn't move, stays in place. And oh what sparkle! I'm definitely going to order another color before they raise the price! Buy it, you won't be disappointed and it came in 4 business days from the East coast to the west coast with free shipping! Usually with free shipping it takes a lot longer because they ship it the cheapest way possible but not these people. I AM DEFINITELY MAKING ANOTHER PURCHASE. <end>  Definately Swarovski Crystal  I purchased the Lavender Blue bracelet and earrings. Both are vibrantly colored, deep blues and purples. Certainly NOT colored glass. The sparkle and shine will convince you. Amazing at this price. <end>  Beautiful!!!  This is a beautiful bracelet! I also bought the matching earrings which are also gorgeous! I bought the set as a gift, and will be purchasing the same set for myself after seeing them. The bracelet really sparkles and is so pretty in the light. The crystals are beautiful shades of purple and blue. Extremely fast shipping as well. I highly recommend the product and seller! <end>  Top Quality  I gifted it to my wife birthday with the set of Earring and bracelet, she loves it. And lot of people appriciated the looks. There is no doubt this is Swarovski. Buy with confidence you will love it. <end>  Very Impressive  This is a very pretty bracelet and it is suprisingly heavy. It realy sparkles in the sunlight. <end>  Perfect  This bracelet is quite simply awesome, I can think of no other word for it. My girlfriend loves it, she wont stop showing it off. It looks even better in person than in the picture. <end>  Swarovski Review  This product came excatly how I expected. It is a very nice peice of jewery and my wife loved it. It was also thicker than I expected and matched the ear rings perfectly. <end>  Horrible quality!  My husband bought a set of this jwelry for my birthday in June and I loved it! But today I found the silver chain turns into totally BLACK! I only weared them twice for my birthay and my friend's wedding and I kept them in their little boxes very well! Only two month they become so ugly! I am very upset and I never see any jwelry has such bad quality! The whole set costs us more than hundred dollars! Feel very very BAD! <end>  Not what I expected  It was a lot bigger then I expected and it was gawdy, just awful, I sent it back, I was so disappointed! <end>  Excellent Quality  I recieved this bracelet sooner than what was quoted in the time frame. The packaging was done well with no tears/dings etc.The bracelet was in impecable shape, nothing wrong with it. I personally feel its prettier up close than it is online. Im glad i decided to get this item. It came just in time for mothers day!!!Excellent vendor to work with! <end>  My wife loves it, don't forget to buy the necklace, too!  My wife bought this for her mom, when it came in I noticed it looked EXACTLY like the picture and my wife smiled and said "Oh yeah..." She was pretty happy with it, don't forget to buy the necklace, too! <end>  nice present  Just simple and nice. Btw, combined blue and clear crystals give it better look vs all same colored ones (I got that one too). <end>  Beautiful, sparkly bracelet!  I just love this bracelet! It's very sparkly and shiny - simply gorgeous! Plus my favorite color is purple, and this definitely has lots of lavender and purple beads. The blue and clear help give it a good 'texture' effect because all the colors go so well with one another. My only complaint is that there weren't more sizes available (only 7 & 1/2"). I could have used at least an 8" bracelet, if not an 8 & 1/2". I like to wear my bracelets big, and this one fits, but it's pretty snug. But that's really my issue, not an issue with the bracelet itself. Very impressive quality, a truly wonderful piece! <end>  Lovely Earrings and Bracelet  These really sparkle much more than is shown by static pictures. They were delivered promptly and well packaged. I will return for more jewelry. <end>  Gorgeous Bracelet  For some reason I looked at the pictures and thought this bracelet to be mostly blue. To my surprise the purple in it was most dominant, which is fine! My girlfriend absolutely loved the bracelet. I'd recommend this bracelet to anyone. <end>  Absolutely mesmerizing  My friend received this bracelet as a Christmas gift from a friend of hers. She wore it to a luncheon and I fell in love the minute I saw it. I thought about it for almost a week and finally called her to say I couldn't get it off my mind. She told me that she really wouldn't mind if I got one and provided me with the Amazon numbers on the package. I ordered the bracelet and the earrings as well. The picture does not do it justice at all. Had I not seen it in person to begin with, I don't think I would have purchased it based on the picture. It is so sparkly and the colors are absolutely beautiful. Even my friend's jeweler's wife was very impressed with it. <end>  Beautiful Bracelet  While this bracelet looks pretty when viewed on line, when you hold it in your hand and wear it... the colors are just beautiful. I like the toggle clasps because they are easier to get on and off and this bracelet has a nice sturdy toggle clasp. The crystals are so pretty and sparkle on your wrist when you wear it. I bought it for myself, but seeing it in person, I think it makes a great gift.Thank you,Cathy Mervyn <end>  Stunning  This bracelet is stunning. It looks classy, elegant, and sparkles like diamonds. The colors are great and there is a good mix of clear to blue to purple. This definitely looks like it is from Swarovksi. The only downside is it can poke your wrist- but I normally don't wear bracelets either. I bought the matching necklace and earrings. The necklace was a huge let down- but I kept it because the bracelet is so gorgeous and I like my jewelry pieces to match. The earrings were good- nothing spectacular like this bracelet though. <end>  I love the sparkles but the beads are graduated  This is a beautiful bracelet and the matching earrings are a must-have but I could not tell from the picture that the beads are graduated. The beads are quite large in the middle, which does not always work on a small wrist. I would have preferred the beads to be all one size (the smaller size ones that are on the ends). It is a good quality piece that sparkles and shines and matches the earrings perfectly. Overall, a great item. <end>  Beautiful  Beautiful bracelt, great price, seller is realiable. Product along with others purchased arrived ahead of time. Excellent. <end>

 B0007A3TDI  Crystal Barbell Tongue Ring MADE WITH SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS ||	  Not smart..  Gem topped barbells are NOT a smart idea.. This thing cut the roof of my mouth so badly.. Not to mention the bead with the gem on it is halfassed glued on.. so that FELL OFF completely in my mouth.Terrible quality. <end>
 B0007A3TFQ  Rose Barbell Tongue Ring MADE WITH SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS ||	  Beautiful but i had to return it  This tongue ring looks absolutely beautiful! The 5mm ball is a great size because if it was any bigger it'd just look unattractive and bulky. But the description never said the ball with the diamond does not screw off so i had to return it because it became useless to me (i bought it with the intention of screwing the balls onto a shorter barbell). I wish i knew ahead of time so i wouldn't have had to go through the trouble of returning it and paying to ship it back. The price is great for such a cute tongue ring. I would have gave it five stars if the diamond ball did screw off. <end>
 B0007D7HIS  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Red Garnet Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Good quality  This ring is well worth the price! I bought it as a pinky ring and it's just perfect. <end>  love it  I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction. <end>  A Disapointment  I know this ring is cheap, but garnets are common stones and that decreases their value. I bought this ring around Christmas and it recently snapped in two. I didn't know sterling silver could break like that. I do not reccommend this product as it is not worth anyone's money. <end>  Love it  This is one of my favorites now. It is great quality for a great price. <end>  Disappointed with the ring, but not with the company  I've had a pleasant experience with Silver Insanity and would order from them again, but the red garnet ring I ordered turned out to be an orange color. They aren't exactly accurate with their pictures, so be careful when ordering. <end>  Great company, pretty good ring  I wear this ring ALL THE TIME! It isn't "cheap" but it's affordable because it's sterling silver, so watch for wearing on the inner band. Fast shipping and overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase! <end>  T.Rimel  This product is beautiful, I liked it more in person. I wear everyday. Fast delivery and safe packaging as well. <end>  Hmmm...  Yeah well, it looked exactly like the picture. With a little imperfection. I don't really like the ring in person though. <end>  Wonderfully cute little ring.  I like this ring very much, it was just a tadbit smaller than I expected. But it's good for the money. <end>  Loved it!  This is a great ring! I love the color, sizing was perfect, I couldn't imagine anything better! <end>  Celtic lover  I bought several pieces to match my Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Red Garnet Ring. I got a beautiful matching bracelet with the Red Garnet, and a pair of matching Celtic Knot Red Garnet earrings! I also got a Sterling Silver celtic Knot bracelet. I absolutely love them all! Great to do business with you! Thanks,Candy  -) <end>  Very nice  I have this ring with the topaz also and both their stonesaren't real, but I still love them! The colors are soft andpretty. They're both too big, but whatever. Love 'em anyway! <end>  A beautiful purchase!  This purchase was absolutely magnificent. The stone is a beautiful deep red color while on the finger, yet when you take it off it turns orange. I bought it for my sister on her birthday and she adores it! I recommend it to anyone who likes medieval looking jewelry. <end>  Broke way too easy  Bought this for my daughter and it broke within months. very poor quality. It looked great when we got it and she only wore it to church and family outings, not to play sports. <end>  OMIGAWD!  I LOVE this ring! It's stunning!!! I love garnet and when i saw this ring i HAD to have it. It arrived like, 2 days later and i'm thrilled to have it! Thank you for carrying such beautiful jewelry. Will deffinately buy from you again  ) <end>  Stone is cheap  I loved the ring when I received it. The silver stood up to constant wearing without becoming misshapen. The problem I had was the garnet started to crack and break, and it was only from normal wear, not abuse. It looks horrible now. I was very disappointed, since I have only had this ring 4 months. <end>  Wrong color?  The delivery was fast and I had no problems. The only problem I had with the ring itself is that instead of being red garnet it looked to be Topaz. <end>  Perfect.  This is a truely beautiful ring that I would happily have paid much more for. The color of the garnet is perfect and the celtic knot pattern looks better than in the picture. <end>  Broken Promise.  This ring was lovely when I first received it, even if the "garnet" was orange. This ring was given to me as a promise ring and I wore it every day but I wasn't rough with it. Even though I was gentle, this ring was misshapen and needed to be replaced within two months. I wouldn't recommend wasting money if this ring will mean something to you, but for a little while it made a nice stand-in. <end>  Great ring, but...  When I received my ring, it fit perfectly. It looked beautiful, too, but the second time I wore it, I noticed that the garnet stone had an orange tinge to it compared to my other garnet jewelry. Other than that, it's a great ring. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Red Garnet Ring  I also like this ring. The fit (size 8) was perfect. I love the color and the design. I would buy again. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Ring A Winner  Lovely, absolutely lovely...delicate and beautiful, well made and at a great price! Came packaged very well, and was definitely photographed appropriately, looked just like it's picture. I couldn't be happier! <end>  silver celtic knot ring  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Red Garnet Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9)The ring is beautiful, really nicer than I expected considering the low price. I like it a lot and am glad I purchased it. <end>  Expected.  It is exactly what I expected, so to say, I knew it was going to be small and flimsy. This is not an expensive ring in any way(the price could have told you that) but it is pretty. I can't wear it in the shower and I worry when I wash my hands. I can bend it easily and scratch it too. <end>  Love it  I really like the Celtic knot on the sides of this ring and the garnet really stands out. Very well made. <end>  Not Worth It  The ring is not very durable. The "sterling silver" is VERY malleable. Which leads me to believe it's not actual silver, but silver plated instead. The ring is pretty and I bought it to match my sister's red garnet celtic cross necklace for her birthday, but the ring did not last more than a month. <end>  Beautiful and durable  I bought this ring over 5 years ago, and it is my favorite ring, aside from my wedding ring. I wear it all the time. Even though the stone isn't real garnet, it is a beautiful rich red and goes well with my other garnet jewelry. I highly recommend this one. <end>  Love it and wearing it!!!!  The days I do not wear the blue one I wear this one. I really enjoy wearing something Celtic and pretty. <end>  Beautiful ring  I bought this ring for myself but my daughter liked it so much I ended up giving it to her and buying myself another one. She is still wearing it more than a year later and it still looks great. It needs little cleaning and stays looking bright and shiny all the time. Very durable and pretty. <end>  Amazing!  I love this ring! I have worn it almost every day since I got it a year ago. I love it and it's just as pretty as the day it arrived. Wonderful quality! Gorgeous! Thank you, Silver Insanity! <end>  Comfortable jewelry  This little ring comes in several colors, is very comfortable to wear, and doesn't get in the way of daily life. <end>  garnet ring  What you see is what you get, nice ring, lived up to my expectations. fast shipping <end>  Good Quality Price  Silver Insanity has some nice products at good prices. I've bought several items for my wife and she is pleased with all of them. <end>  One ring to rule them all  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Celtic Knot Ring (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9)Bought this little ring for my wife as a "just because" present. Let's just say I got something in return ;) These rings are beautifully crafted and look good with just about anything...(or nothing at all) <end>  Gave as a gift- she loved it.  I gave this ring to a friend from college. Although I was slightly disappointed by how small the ring was, she has dainty hands and it fit perfectly. The stone is a beautiful deep red, and the silver work is intricate and well done. <end>  Celtic Knot Ring  The ring is beautiful and is well made. I am impressed that it's so nice with such a low price. I would get another one in a heartbeat! <end>  love it  I love this ring. I've gotten many compliments on it. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with is that the stone is more of an orange color instead of red. <end>  garnet stone  i liked the ring however i was very disappointed that the garnet stone was more orange than the dark red of the true garnet i was hopeing for. this was a very special ring for my daughter whose boyfriend was named Redd and his favorite color was red and his birth stone was garnet. i ordered this ring for her in remembrence ofRedd as he was murdered only days before. so this was a very special ring to us. we were hoping for a more blood red color of a true garnet. <end>  Great Buy!  I purchased this ring for my daughter. She really likes it. It is a nice ring of decent quality. The product was shipped withing the promised time frame with no problems in the transaction at all. <end>  Celtic Garnet Ring  The ring is pretty, even though it does not look as it was advertised. The ring was described as "red garnet" and is actually an orange color. I still feel I received good value for the money spent. Shipping was quicker than promised. <end>  Garnet?  When I received this ring, I was very happy with the design, and the look of the sterling silver. Unfortunately I did not receive a nice garnet in the setting. It is not even RED! I received an orange garnet, which quite upset me because my other ring I wear is a deep red garnet. <end>  Wanting to buy it, but...  I have the same ring with the Topaz stone and it is already about to break. I noticed, early on, how easily the ring bent & tried to be easy with it, but it has still already got a crack on the band. I think the ring is beautiful, I just don't want another disappointment. There are such differing opinions on the reviews, it makes me think people are getting completely different rings! <end>  BEAUTIFUL  This ring. is so pretty. More than what I expected. So happy I got it very true to size and the picture does not do this ring justice <end>  Not perfect  The craftsmanship on the one I received isn't perfect, but it's a substantial ring with a decent-looking stone. For 12 bucks you can't go wrong. <end>  Lovely gift for my teenage daughter  I bought this ring for my 17 year old daughter. It is beautifully made and wonderfully priced. My only complaint is that the stone is a little more orange than I would have liked. I was hoping for a darker red. But, I know she'll love it! <end>  Ring Purchase  It was my first time I purchase jewlry from Amazon. I was extremely please with the product and I have received many compliments. I have told all my friends were I purchase the ring. I plan on making more purchases with this company, they were prompt with the order and I loved the selection of jewlry.Thank YouDiana Hall -Jerome Idaho <end>  Great price, makes nice "pinky ring"  I bought it because I had been looking for rings in a size 4 that I could wear as pinky rings. This one fit the bill and was quite inexpensive. The garnet is kind of orangish rather than blood red like the picture shows -- that's why this ring gets four stars instead of five. But for the price, I am not complaining. And size 4 rings seem to be rare. <end>  Celtic Ring Review  I purchaced this ring for my neice and she just loves it. It is lovely. <end>  love it!  I was really impressed with this ring -- an excellent value! <end>  Great Value - Very Satisfied  Bottom LIne - My wife was thrilled. She loves all things Celtic. I love all things that provide a good value. I was skeptical because of the price point but was very happy with not only the items ordered and from this seller but was very happy with the fast delivery, and careful packaging. All my thumbs are up for this transaction <end>  Garnet Celtic Silver Ring  This was an inexpensive ring that is well made. Perfect for a January birthday daughter who loves all things celtic! <end>  Beautiful ring!  I love this ring beyond words. I love the color of the stone and the intricacy of the silver. It overall is a bit smaller than I thought, but I don't really care. It is a beautiful ring and I love it. I wear it with pride and I am very pleased with this purchase and I look forward to showing it off. <end>  nice ring - exactly as described  This ring was on my wife's Wish List. I ordered it and stuck it in her Christmas stocking. It was well received.The ring arrived in a small velvet bag with a pull cord, which was a nice touch. Arrived before the scheduled delivery date. <end>  Beautiful!  I love this ring! It's feminine but still has a presence on your finger. The red is quite beautiful. If I want another ring I'll be coming right back here for it, mainly because I have a difficult time finding rings in my size (which is 5) usually sizing starts at 6. I'm very pleased. <end>  How much I LOVE to wear it!!!  I LOVE THIS RING!!! I've been wearing it EVRYDAY ever since I've got it, also I belive it's real silver!!! <end>  THE GIRL'S JUST GOTTA HAVE HER RINGS!  BOUGHT THIS RING FOR MY DAUGHTER AND I KNOW SHE'S GOING TO LOVE IT. THE QUALITY OF THIS RING GOES WAY BEYOND THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG ORDERING FROM AMAZON.COM!!!!!! <end>
 B0007DI1J2  Sterling Silver Tiger Eye Pendant Necklace ||	  Quality Control Problems  I ordered this pendant about two weeks ago choosing free shipping. It arrived on Fri. Sept. 17th. The item was well packaged and the box was undamaged. As I opened the box I began to notice problems. The snake chain and pendant were in separate zip lock bags. When I opened the bag with the chain, a short length of very small jump rings fell on the floor. This was obviously an "adjuster chain" to vary the length of the snake chain. I carefully examined it and found no separations or broken links. So whoever packaged it just threw them in together. I then noticed that the snake chain had been crushed several inches from one end, causing an irreparable kink.I then examined the pendant itself. The setting was cast silver and the stone was not bezel set but rather cut to the size of the casting and glued in place (like an inlay). The stone had been poorly cut. leaving a gap at the top, and it had the lower left corner cut off, thus leaving another gap. The bale was crooked, listing about 10 degrees to the right. And finally, while the piece had been advertised as red tiger eye, it was not. It was common golden tiger eye with two tiny red stripes near the center. I'm not naive, I know that this is a factory piece and is at a low price point. I liked the overall design of the pendant and would have kept it as a gold tiger eye if there hadn't been so many quality problems. As a result, I returned it. <end>
 B0007IIV2Y  7" Sterling Silver Braided Herring Bone Bracelet ||	  Very pretty but a touch long for my taste  I had my eye on this bracelet for quite some time and finally decided to go for it. It's very pretty - the silver is bright and shiny and having 3 chains braided together gives it a nice thickness (looks like about 5 - 6 mm). It actually measures a little over 7 inches - I have a thin wrist and would have preferred 7 inches on the nose (clasp included - or even a tiny bit shorter!). I still like it, though, and at this price I think it is a keeper. It would be nice to have a braided herringbone neckchain this width (18 - 20 inches). <end>
 B0007IMNV4  Antique Silver Crystalline Gem FAN Dangle Belly Ring ||	  You get what you pay for...  I've had it for 3 months and that "antique-look" is discolored and all except one gem has fallen off. I guess this is good for you if you like disposable jewelry. <end>
 B0007KI52I  Sterling Silver Delicate Marcasite Cross Ring Size 9(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  Cross ring  My ring is well made and beautiful. Like the "old" look it has and have ordered a couple of them. Just remember....God is good and faithful...all the time. <end>
 B0007L0K84  Ring - R63 - Swarovski (tm) Crystal Stretch - Size Lg ~ Black Diamond (Gray / Grey) ||	  Very different  I like this style of ring--not gaudy--just the right amount of bling. Just the right size. It has an antiqueflair. <end>
 B0007L0KES  Ring - R45 - Swarovski (tm) Crystal Stretch - Square Style - Size Lg ~ Siam Red ||	  Very Nice  For the price of this ring I wasn't sure what I'd be getting...but this ring is really quite pretty and very well made. <end>
 B0007L432S  Sterling Silver Celtic Cross Pendant, 1 1/3 inch long ||	  Cool  I'm very happy with my purchase. The product arrived in 2 days from the time it was shipped. It is great for someone who wants a Celtic cross that isn't too big, but also isn't too small. I'd say its for a guy or a girl, but you might want to order a separate necklace to hold the pendant, if it is for a guy. <end>
 B0007L4396  Sterling Silver OM (Omkar) Pendant, 1 inch long ||	  very satisfied  It is made of silver and doesn't get dirty fast.I purcased this because of my spiritual interest, it is a hindu sign and it means  all, perfection. <end>  Love the charm!  I had to put this on another chain because the one it came with is too long for me, but otherwise, I really like it. It's a good size - nice and simple in design. <end>  gift  This was a gift for my wife and she wears it quite often. Size is about accurate to what you see on the screen. Finish has been fine and doesn't show any signs of wearing off yet. <end>  Nice look and feel - could be heavier  Great product for the price. However, I wish the manufacturer would have a heavier, albeit more expensive, option. <end>  SS Omkar Charm  I found this to be very light weight; morelike for a child. I wished that it had more of a shine and weight to it. The design is good <end>
 B0007LNEI2  Sterling Silver 7mm Square Invisible Set Clear Cubic Zirconia Post Friction Back Stud Earrings ||	  Love em  These earrings are great quality and I get positive comments on them very often. They go with everything, dressing up or down... I would recommend to anyone wanting a great pair of earrings at a great value. --One of many purchases from this seller  Gem Avenue. Thank you! <end>
 B0007LNEIC  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Lavender Princess Stud Post Earrings ||	  beautiful but not practical  These earrings are very pretty to look at but the stones are easily removed from their setting. I had mine on for about 2 hours and the stone popped right out when my hair got caught on an edge...I probably would not have bought had I known how fragile the setting was. <end>  dont trust!  this website's colors are not accurate especially for the cubic zirconia "lavender" earings they BARELY have any purple or "lavender" one can barely tell it has color! they are cheap and not worth your time! <end>
 B0007M0UKQ  Diamond Accented Cross Pendant in 10K White Gold ||	  Eye-catching, smaller than you think  I get a fair amount of positive comments on this piece of jewelry, especially since the cross appears to be floating. The gold is of good quality and gets worn almost daily. However, my husband and I were both very suprised to see how small it was compared to the rendering in the picture. The diamond chip is pretty much non-existent, so if you are looking for flash, this is not it. In retrospect, small and inconspicuous is actually what I wanted, but when I first opened it, I was surprised.All in all, I would purchase it again at this price. <end>  Tiny Pendent - Super Thin Chain - TERRIBLE BUY  This items is tiny. Not even worth 40 dollars in my opinion. I bought it has a gift and had to return it. The chain is so fine, it looks like it would break if you touched it. The pendent is the size of a finger nail. Terrible buy. <end>  Love the design, the chain is too long  My wife wore this daily until it was forgotten in a move. She still misses it. I'll likely buy another to replace it. The chain is quite long on it, especially considering how small the cross is. We ended up having to get the chain shortened up quite a bit, but after that, it was good to go. Include about 2/3 the chain and it'd be perfect.*edit 5/12/2009*I ordered up a replacement for my wife, and the chain is now much shorter. It's absolutely perfect for her. She's a smaller lady, so that's something to consider. I'd update this review to a 5 star if I could since I have no complaints whatsoever on it. <end>  very small  This is a very pretty dainty cross, just much smaller than I thought it would be. It arrived safely in good condition, from a good vendor, thanks! <end>
 B0007MYQ3S  Sterling Silver Roman Style Armor Band Ring(Sizes 4.5,5,5.5,6,6.5,7,8,9) ||	  Quality piece. Recommend.  Quality piece. Sizes run very tiny, however. Bought this a long time ago and have since lost it. Wish I hadnt... <end>
 B0007MYQ42  Sterling Silver Dainty Openwork Butterfly Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Pretty  My sis wanted this because she is into this 'butterfly' phase. It's exactly the way you see it. For the price it's an excellent gift for a sibling, as a friendship ring and for young loved ones. Or just for yourself as an everyday ring. <end>  The title does not lie.  The rings is in fact dainty and small. The item turned out to be smaller than I expected, but beautiful the same. The ring would look very nice on a woman with small hands or a child, but is as pretty as the picture provided. <end>
 B0007NBT1O  Sterling Silver Antique Finish 3mm Butterfly Ring Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  butterfly ring  I love the design and quality of the ring but size not true / need size 8 can I exchange thank you <end>  I LOVE THIS RING!  Its so pretty and it got here fast! I was a little scared it would turn my finger green cause of the price, BUT IT DIDN'T and I've worn it everyday since mid april. <end>  Great /service and Price  I ordered this ring for my daughter-in-law who loves butterflies. I was a bit nervous because I ordered it late around the 18th of December. To my surprise it was shipped immediately at regular shipping price and it arrived on the 23rd!!! Wow. The service is excellent and the prices are right. Thank you!! L.Y <end>
 B0007NGC3O  Sterling Silver Turquoise Nugget Beaded Coil Bracelet ||	  A good value for the money  I ordered two of the bracelets and one was a longer (coiled) wire bracelet than the other. Luckily, we will be wearing them together so it won't matter. I do plan to order again from this manufacturer <end>
 B0007NI1Q0  SCER008 Sterling Silver Clear Crystal Cluster Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  lovely earrings  I ordered these earrings and loved them. I got so many compliments on them that I ended up ordering the multi-colored ones as well as the violet ones and love them all. I highly recommend these earrings. They are lovely and delicate. Very classy looking and beautiful. <end>  Sparkle and Shine  These earrings are very pretty and sparkle with color. They pick up the colors in your outfit. I love the lever backs too. Great value for the money. <end>  Swarovski Crystal Dangle Earrings  I bought these earrings and they are very pretty. I bought the clear colored ones because they will match different colored outfits since they pick up whatever color is around them. <end>  Lots of sparkle  These earrings are sparkly and lovely. I bought them to match a Sawrovski crystal necklace a friend recently brought me from Austria. They are such a perfect match in cut and color that you would think necklace and earrings were bought as a set. It was the clear pictures and the diagram of the earring as it would look in the ear that made such an accurate match possible. <end>  The earring broke as crystal loosen from bottom just passed their return policy day  The earring broke as crystal loosen from bottom just passed their return policy day, worn a few times only, the needle head is too small or the wire is too thin to hold these crystals. The shipping was over charged. Disappointed! Written by buyer's wife. <end>  Dainty and Pretty  These are very nice - they reflect the light very well and are very pretty. They can be worn with a casual outfit as well as when you are dressing up. I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Tarnished  My husband bought these earrings for me because they were on my wish list, they are nice and a nice size, however the metal is very tarnished. I would like to think that when items are being packed for shipping that someone is giving them the once over, I guess that is not the case. Needless to say, we will be returning them. <end>  Great gift  Product just as described, my daughter liked it when I gave it to her for Christmas. Good product anyone who wears earrings would love. <end>  Rusted metals  Hi,I bought this for a present, but the metal pieces came al rusted and worn out. Crystals are amazing, but what was supposed to be Silver is all dark. I cannot give it as a present looking like this.. I know Silver might get dark IN TIME, if it's in contact with skin, due to body grease and dust but not out of the box.I uploaded an image about this.It's not the first time I buy stuff from this guys, but seems to be like a lottery, hoping your product to come as described.thx. <end>  Not really as pictured...  These earrings look good in the picture, but in person they look cheap. It looks like each crystal is hanging on its own in the picture, but really, they hang straight down in 2 rows on either side of the wire. The 2 rows are fastened to each other. They DO NOT dangle individually. Also, the crystals look really fake. Like plastic with shiny gloss on them. <end>  YES!  Absolutely dreamy.They go with ANY blouse and takes the color of what you wear.SOOOolight and airy.Believe me...you'll feel yourself flipping you hair back just to show them off. <end>  NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM  I AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE MY ITEM. SO I COULDN'T POSSIBLY RATE SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE. EXCEPT TO SAY THAT ITS TAKEN WAY TOO LONG TO RECEIVE. <end>  "Awesome" Earrings  "Awesome" Earrings - I LOVE wearing them - very comfortable and I get lots of compliments too!FAST shipping - I HIGHLY recommend this seller. Very pleased with the earrings. <end>  Elegant and sophisticated  I was looking for a pair of earrings that I could wear to work but also wear out to dinner. These are the perfect earrings and complement any outfit. The crystals are beautiful and look like they cost a fortune. Really great product, now I need to order the other available colors. <end>  Gorgeous  I bought these for my daughter and really wished I had bought a pair for myself. They are quite beautiful, very sparkly and reflective. They seem sturdy but only time will tell. <end>  Love Love Love  Love them I get complimentsSCER008 Stylish Clear Swarovski Crystal Cluster Sterling Silver Lever back 1" Long Dangle Earringson them all the time <end>  Not too big, not too little, just right!  I bought these for my wedding, needing something other than the earrings that came with the necklace set I bought.I was afraid that these would be too "bright" for the crystal beads on my dress, but these turned out to be just perfect! They really do catch the light, but not overpoweringly so.I like the backs on the earrings, they are very secure!These held up to a night of dancing, and at a great price, I couldn't have asked for anything more! <end>  Gem Avenue  I am very pleased with this seller and their product. I ordered the swarovski cyastal cluster earring for my sister and they are just beautiful very sparkly and they pick up the color you're wearing. she has worn them everyday since I gave them to her. I would definately buy from this seller again the product is beautiful and it arrived very quickly and in great condition.Thank-you <end>  Very Happy  I was so pleased to receive my earrings and find that they were as beautiful as they looked online. In addition, they weren't 1/4th the size that they appeared as so often happens when you by on the internet. I will use this company over and over. <end>  Even good for everyday.  I've read the reviews on these earrings and how they're good for special occasions. I wear them every day and haven't taken them off since I got them in the mail. They're lightweight (a big bonus for me) and just look good. I've gotten numerous compliments on them as they dress up anything you're wearing...from jeans to a fancy dress. I'm planning to get them in a different color and other pieces to match. <end>  Dazzling earrings!  My daughter bought me these earrings for Christmas and they are absolutely dazzling! I received many compliments on them! They are crystal-like clear earrings, so they beautifully reflect light creating dazzling colors. Perfect for the holidays and year-round for special evenings and events! <end>  Pretty  Very pretty earrings. Delicate and sparkly. Excellent quality for gift giving. Arrived quickly, included a nice silver gift box. Also bought the "Sterling Silver Clear Swarovski Crystal 7" 7.5" 8" Length Adjustable Bracelet With Lobster Clasp" which is a perfect match. Highly recommended. <end>  Cute  These are exactly as I expected, not too big not too small. Fun earrings. <end>  Nice and sparkly  I ordered these earrings over the holidays and I love them. They sparke and add an extra "oomph" to my outfit. I wore them to a holiday party and received a lot of compliments on them. I've since then ordered other multi-colored ones. I definitely recommend these earrings. They sparkle and dress up any outfit. <end>  She loves it!  I gave it to my son's piano teacher.She likes it!It is pretty ear ring. <end>  Great Gift  I got these as a gift for my boyfriend's sister. She had them on her wish list. She loved them and thought they looked even better than they do in the picture. <end>  Cluster Earrings  I got these earrings for myself and they are one of the prettiest pairof earrings I've ever had. They are just the way they are pictured. <end>  sparkle  I love the sparkle of these earrings. They reflect any color that is nearby so is constantly changing. More importantly, they never clash with what you are wearing. I love the clasp backs and the price. A perfect gift. Amy <end>  Nothing Sparkles Like Swarovski Crystals  I'm a girl that loves sparklies. These earrings were made to order. They are just perfect; very pretty, feminine and the price was the best part. I have several other pieces marked to buy after Christmas. Finding this web site was great.k. marsh <end>  Memories  My Wife had a pair like these on her wedding day, but lost them in one of our moves. They look even better in person, and my wife loves them! <end>  beautiful  These earrings are beautiful. I bought them to wear at my daughter's wedding. They are stunning and not too gaudy. I plan on buying the other colors. The quality is excellent for the price. <end>  Pretty earrings!  I just love the style and lengthof these earrings. Their clearcrystal nature picks up any coloryour wearing. They're great! <end>
 B0007NI1QU  SCER010 Sterling Silver Simple Beauty Black Clear Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Great product for the price  I love these earrings because they go with any outfit. I prefer lever back and dangle earrings so this pair fits in very well with my tastes. I am very happy with them. <end>  More beautiful than expected  Ordered these for mom. They're perfectly sparkly, high quality hardware and a lot nicer than I would expect for the price! <end>  Not impressed for the price....  For the price, I certainly expected more when it arrived. There was no "WOW" factor when I opened it up. They will be okay for everyday wear but they do not meet my expectations for the amount of money I spent. Had I seen them in the store, they would have stayed in the store. The grey is almost completely clear and the black is not that dark either so it is if you have a slightly charcoal grey with clear beads. Not sure what pair they took the picture of but they are not what arrived at my house. <end>  Awesome Earrings!  I never bought crystal jewelry before. I thought that crystal looked cheap. But these earrings were beautiful! These size is perfect and the shape and color is great. <end>  Beautiful Earrings!  I have been looking for lever-back dangle earrings for my black outfits and I am so happy I came across these and ordered them. When the sun or light catch them, the earrings glisten so much. Perfect pair of earrings. You can't gp wrong with them! <end>  Not what I expected  I realize that these are not expensive jewelry, but I have earrings that I've paid less for that look much better. I was disappointed with these. I love the colors, as I wear a lot of black and thought these looked great online. Simply put, they just look cheap. Even the silver leverback looks & feels cheap. Very disappointed. <end>  These are NOT Swarovski Crystal  These earrings are really pretty which is why I didn't give them only 1 star. They are however completely falsely represented in the sense that the description is a flat out LIE! The beads are not Swarovski crystal, they are merely sparkly beads that you can buy at a hobby shop. I've seen the exact same beads at Hobby Lobby and they are an inexpensive synthetic crystal (I make jewelry in my spare time and I could make these for less than $5 a pair, so you guys are being ripped off). I'm really upset that these are total fakes and from now on I will only buy swarovski crystal jewelry from certified swarovski dealers and never on Amazon again. <end>  Beautiful earrings for cheap  I wore these with a nice black dress and they looked great. I agree with the other reviewers that they look high quality for the price. <end>  Very Beautiful  This is just beautiful!!!! very shiny and very sparkly!!! If anyone is on the fence about it, I say to get it!!! You won't be disappointed !!!! It's not too big....just the right size, perfect for everyday use!! and the delivery was very quick!!! <end>  Great Earrings  I have both the black-and-clear version and the blue-and-lavender version, and I love them both. The weight and length are nice for everyday wear, and even with long hair they have a nice "flash." My mother talked into giving her my first pair of black-and-clear ones, so I just ordered a second pair. I love lever backs, which are getting harder to find. <end>  Great for the price  I bought these for my wife because we agreed to not buy each other gifts this year so that we could save money for our home downpayment. I wanted to get her something that was nice, but inexpensive anyways (and break our agreement). I liked these because they matched a black & white diamond necklace I bought for her a few years back. At the price I didn't expect much, but hoped they would at least be presentable. I was pleasantly surprised. The quality is excellent. Though obviously not to the standard of a true swarovski piece or other fine jewelry, it holds it own very well and is among her favorite costume pieces. I had to show her what I paid for it to prove I didn't splurge. She thought they were worth much more than what I paid. <end>  Jewelry  I just love these earrings!! I use them for casual as well as more dressy attire. The quality is excellent and I receive so many compliments whenever I wear them. The length is perfect for when I wear my hair down (which is long) or when I wear it up or in a ponytail! Also, I really like the leverback because I know I won't lose them. They are a great buy and so well designed and crafted. <end>  Nice earrings for any occasion  I originally bought a pair of these (in pink) for one of my nieces for her birthday. She loved them, as did everyone else. I have since bought two more pairs  one in blue for her sister and one in black for myself. They are stylish and can be worn with anything, dressy or casual.The earrings are light and well-strung. The clasp is perfect. There is no way for these earrings to fall out or fall forward as dangling earrings with open clasps sometimes do.I plan on purchasing the matching necklaces and bracelets in all three colors. <end>  Lovely earrings  I was really excited when I received my package earlier today. These earrings are gorgeous and simple. The shipping was fast and I love the way the crystals look in the sun. For those who say they are fake, probably don't know swarovski crystals that well. I interned in a Swarovski store so I know that they are real. <end>  My mom loves them  This was a gift for my mom last christmas. She loves them, they are really pretty and she receives a lot of compliments when using them. Very happy with this purchased. <end>  The perfect earrings.  I really love the look of these earrings! I was trying to match a necklace and they turned out to be perfect! Another advantage is the Leverbacks since I don't like hooks that get caught in my hair. The Black and Clear Swarovski Crystals are beautiful and the earrings have a very dressy look without being too long for me. <end>  SIMPLY ENCHANTING  I purchased these earrings for my daughter who is quite a fussy gal. She loves them. That says it all for me. <end>  Lovely earrings  "These are lovely earrings and arrived promptly. They look like the online photo and are dressy and sparkly! The lever back closures are easy to use and eliminate the fear of losing and earrings with wires only. I am very happy with this purchase. I saw the comments regarding the "shorter than expected" length of these so pay attention to the description if that's an issue for you. " <end>  More beautiful in person  I bought these because I have no black earrings at all. When I saw the picture I thought, ok, these look good, I'll take them. When I got them (2 days later) I was completely shocked to see how really beautiful they are. Very sparkly, very lightweight, yet great quality. I am not disappointed in them whatsoever! I can wear them to the office but I can also wear them with my "little black dress" for special occasions. They're so versitile! BTW, if you have short hair or wear your hair up, the light catches them just right and they will just sparkle. <end>  Swarovski, not too sure.  These earrings are pretty, but seem to be plastic. I'm not convinced that they are Swarovski crystals. But for the price they are nice and work well with black and white clothes. <end>  Beautiful earrings  I love these earrings. The length is nice, and they are perfect with both casual and dressy outfits. They don't look "over the top" if you're going to work or out with a friend. I disagree with the customer who was disappointed by the length. Usually, unless specified otherwise, the length includes the lever back of earrings, the bezel of a pendant, etc.The design is pretty, the quality is excellent, and I LOVE leverbacks because I don't lose the earring! <end>  Gorgeous and versatile!  I picked out these earring for Christmas when my husband wanted ideas for my stocking...and they do not disappoint! As another reviewer said, they are shorter than I thought...but their beauty outshines that issue completely. Definitely more beautiful than the picture and goes with soooo many outfits. Many people have commented on their simplicity and elegance. I was also impressed with the quality of the materials used! I will definitely order from this seller again - gorgeous product! <end>  Even prettier than the picture  These are beautiful and sparkling - the picture doesn't really capture how pretty they are. I love them! <end>  Swarovski Crystal Sterling Silver Leverback 1.5" Dangle Earrings  The earrings are beautiful. I have received compliments every time I wear them and the matching necklace. I love the way they sparkle. <end>  Beautiful !  I bought a pair like these in a different color and received so many compliments, I bought several more pair in different colors! <end>  Simply Lovely  Lovely earrings that look much more expensive than the price would indicate. Just the right length and sparkle. Definitely would purchase here again. <end>  Swarovski Crystal Earrings  Very pretty earrings. They sparkle nicely in the light. I love that they match almost anything that I wear. <end>  Pretty  Love these earrings! These go with so many different outfits that they've become a favorite to wear. Not super flashy, but noticeable enough that I've gotten several compliments. <end>  Beautifulu  Love these earrings - so much I ordered 3 different pair! Very pretty and versatile - casual or dressy! They are a must have!! <end>  nice earrings  These earrings are just like the picture but with lots of sparkle. Good strong well made leverbacks. They are a little smaller than I expected but still reasonable in size and pretty. <end>  Beautiful!!  I bought these for a friend for her birthday. I haven't given thrm to her yet but I'm sure she will love them. I do! <end>  My sister loved it  It was a gift for my sister and she loved them. They were exactly as shown in the pic.The ear rings were neatly packed and it was ensured that they don't get damaged in transit. <end>  They were listed as Swarovski element crystals earrings,  I was expecting Swarovski crystals and more shine, the picture looked brighter than the earrings did. I guess Swarovski elements as they were described are not as bright as Swarovski crystals. They were very nice about the refund and the free return shipping. <end>  Swarovski Crystal Earrings  I bought these earrings as a present for my son to give to my sister. They were even nicer than the picture. The price was great and delivery was prompt also. <end>  Disappointed  The description is misleading - the earrings are much smaller than described. It should state that the leverback is part of the length. If I had known this I would not have purchased them. They're OK, but not great. I would think twice before buying jewelry here again. <end>  Great  I bought this earrings for my fianc&eacute; and she love it, it a great earrings and will recommended it for anyone to but it <end>  Great neutral colors  Second pair of these I bought for my girlfriends went with the black because its a nice neutral color and she loved it. Wearings with her neutral colored clothing and looks great. She loved them. Recommend. <end>  Very pretty  These earrings arrived yesterday, nicely packaged and right on time. They look pretty much like the image, but of course, the cyrstals are much more sparkly. This is a wonderful addition to my earring collection; they can be worn dress up or dress down. <end>  Sterling Silver Simple Beauty Black Clear Crystal Earrings  These earrings are exactly as pictured in size and color. The size and design are perfect for casual /everyday wear and they have a lot of sparkle and shine. <end>  Look more expensive  They are small-ish, so that is why I give them four stars, but otherwise they look nice and they even look more expensive than they actually are. <end>  A very glamorous little gift  These black and clear crystal earrings were a great gift for my wife for New Years. These went together very well with the dress she wore for our NYE party. The cost to quality factor is very good and I am looking now at something for Valentines Day from the same seller. <end>  Just what she wanted  I bought these as a gift for my wife from her amazon wish list. Could not have been easier or more economical and they were just what she wanted. They go nicely with a necklace I purchased on Amazon before. <end>  beautiful and match everything!  very beautiful and match everything! They are made of well and of great quality, doesn't look nor feel cheap in any way. <end>

 B0007NJDNA  Pugster Dangle Sun Flower Italian Charms ||	  Love these clips  I've been searching a long time for hair clips that will stay securely in place the whole day on my 7-year old daughter's very fine hair. These clips are not only pretty and uniquely designed, they also hold on very well to my daughter's hair so that her hair stays neatly in place even after a very active day in school! I'll purchase a few more pairs to give as gifts. <end>

 B0007NLA7M  Pugster Name Lauri Laser Italian Charms ||	  Charmed, Italian style  I ordered this charm for my daughter who's name is not often found the way it is spelled.

Its a lot of fun! <end>
 B0007NOFJM  Pugster Name Liz Italian Charms Bracelet Link ||	  Pugster rocks my italian charm world.  I bought a bracelet for myself and my sister. We went crazy buying charms on amazon (and other websites). Pugster is by far the best when it comes to first (and most importantly) quality, prices, customer serivce, fast shipping. I bought a couple from other companies and it was hard to even see what the picture was. This company has all the details very defined on each charm-where as others can be blury or muddled looking. I am very pleased and will continue to be a repeat customer. Go to their website directly for shipping discounts and special deals. <end>
 B0007OEZ9Q  Question Mark Gold Belly Ring ||	  Cute, Compfy Belly Ring @ Excellent Price  This belly ring is awesome. Its design makes it very comfortable, and you can't beat the classic 14K gold and cubic zirconian combination. <end>
 B0007OOEV0  Pugster Gold Plated Letteritalian Charm Bracelet ||	  swimming  This is a great little charm. It looks just like the picture and holds a lot of detail. The water is sparkly. The charm is elevated, so it does throw off the balance of the bracelet if you don't have other elevated charms too. <end>
 B0007P4NP6  Amethyst & Diamond Drop Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Very gracious about return  I returned these earrings only because I changed my mind. They were very lovely and just as pictured. The vendor was very gracious about the exchange and my credit was processed quickly. <end>

 B0007P6FQQ  Actor And Actress Thespian Italian Charm ||	  thespian charm  Not what I thought. Doesn't look like anything when received. Difficult attaching the charm to a necklace. Recipient was not thrilled with it. <end>
 B0007P6FXE  Earth Italian Charm ||	  Beautiful!  I was given a charm bracelet by a friend some years ago with this kind of charm on it. Unfortunately, the earth fell off of that one, but it has not on this newer one. Excellent! <end>
 B0007P8GWW  Multi Gemstone Bezel Bracelet - JewelryWeb ||	  Poor Clasp - Stay Away!  I purchased this bracelet as a gift last December. The quality of the clasp is quite poor and it gradually lost it ability to stay closed. Recently, the bracelet fell off because of the poor clasp and was damaged greatly. Avoid this bracelet! <end>
 B0007P9OPA  Emerald Green Titanium Ball Belly Button Ring ||	  Nice but....  I bought 2 of these based on the color and other descriptions of them. One of them broke after only about 3 days. I wrote to the seller and they promptly sent me a new one; which broke again. It's not like this piece of jewelry is in an area where it will get 'caught' on things; or is pulled....so I can only deduce that it's the workmanship. Great service from the seller though! <end>
 B0007P9OU0  Brilliant Butterfly Passion Pink Gem Belly Ring ||	  Body Jeweler  Make sure you know what sizes you need I like the product and the company has a great return policy <end>
 B0007PO5GS  New England Patriots Logo Earrings ||	  Cute Earrings  These cheap, cute little earrings are great for football fans who like to try to bring their team a little luck! The logos are small but well detailed and are great for football party wear when you want your wife or girlfriend to show off team spirit. My wife says they are comfortable and fun to wear in such a setting. Definitely worth buying! <end>  Just what I wanted!  Looked all over for basic logo earrings and saw these - they were perfect!

She was thrilled with these. It was an item that she did not yet have. <end>  adorable  anyone who is a Patriot's fan will love these. They are bigger than I thought they would be which was a pleasant surprise. <end>  Great gift  My wife absolutely loves these earrings. She's grown into quite the patriots fan over the years we've been married. From what she says they don't dangle too much like she was a little afraid of, and don't weigh anything. <end>
 B0007PO5YA  Radical Jawbreaker Horseshoe Circular Barbell ||	  I liked it until..  I liked it until it broke. One of the balls just cracked and it wasn't bad enough to take it out. The next morning I woke up and BOTH balls were gone. It is very stylish I'm just sad it broke so easily  / <end>
 B0007PQNZO  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Worry Spin Ring(Sizes 7,8,9,10,11,12,13) ||	  You get what you pay for...  Not exactly what I expected. The inner celtic knotwork actually is detached from the ring and spins. I found that the knotwork is poorly carved though only I would notice unless someone examined the ring closely. Nice and shiney though and very inexpensive. Would make a cheap good gift for others. <end>  Nice Ring  I was told that the wide of this ring was 3/8" and was 1/4" I realize about that until I received it. I didn't get what I wanted. The ring its ok. <end>
 B0007PRAEM  Belly - 7/16 Cool Clear Banana Belly Ring ||	  =)  While the color itself isn't that interesting - duh - the belly ring was of good quality. BodyCandy sells very nice and inexpensive products. <end>
 B0007PRALA  Carribean Sea Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Got a tongue ring, just not this one  The piece of jewelery was very pretty from the picture, I saw that one of the reviews had said they had shipped a different color. I decided to risk it, since it's so cheap. I did end up getting the wrong color, a purple one. You get what you pay for so I'm not upset, still would have liked this one though. <end>  This is so beautiful!  The piercing looked exactly like the pictureIts so pretty I can't stop looking at it!!I highly recommend thisYou wont regret it! <end>  no complaints  It's a very pretty tongue ring - looks just as pictured. I've never had a problem with the balls staying on. <end>  Did NOT look like the picture  I received this tongue ring and it looks nothing like the picture. It is very light and just looks clear with glitter in it. VERY disappointed. <end>
 B0007Q2Z2S  Large Sterling Silver Moveable 3D Owl Charm Pendant ||	  Just what I wanted!  This owl pendant is so cute, and just what I wanted! It is high quality and has a nice weight to it, also it's a little shinier than it looks in the picture but is still a nice cool mellow silver color. Not the too-bright tacky stuff you see sometimes. The head turns a little and the wings are set on pins so they can sort of spin around. I added a chain with the gift options at checkout and was very pleased with that, too - a delicate silver box chain that is thin yet sturdy. Great price, great item, I'd definitely do business with Silver Insanity again. It only took 3 days to arrive with standard delivery. <end>  Gorgeous!  I love owls and I was looking for a pendant. This one was perfect! The details are beautiful and the moving parts are pretty cool. I have received many compliments. Also an excellent price. <end>  A real charmer  Gave this owl charm to my partner for his birthday a couple years back and he just adores it. It is sturdy and cute, the neck and wings move and the details on it are amazing. <end>  LOVE!!!  My fiance got this wonderful little charm for me as a reward when I quit smoking. I wasn't sure if I'd like it when I read about the size.As soon as it arrived and I opened it, I knew it was perfect! It's got a nice weight. It's beautiful. It's sturdy (I've been wearing it 24/7 for about 6 months now and haven't had any issues). It has moving wings and its head turns slightly from side to side.I've received tons of compliments on it as well! I'm saving the page for it so if anything does happen to the one I've got, I can buy a new one. <end>
 B0007Q2Z4G  Winged Sterling Silver Spread Out Phoenix Wing Earrings ||	  Yeay!  Finally, a phoenix that doesn't look like a dragon! Just the right size, and beautiful detail. I love it! <end>  Phoenix earrings  I had bought the pendant first and got rave reviews. I then purchased the earrings and they are very nice. It is a nice set and has meaning for me. <end>  Not what I thought they would be  I was surprised to see the size of these earrings, they are so light you have to touch your ears on occasion to make sure they're still on. They have a habit of not hanging correctly. The design is nice but it's almost too small to see. <end>  Phoenix wing earings  I was not as pleased with these earrings as I was with the matching pendant because they were so very small. Still they are very pretty earrings and my wife was pleased with them..... <end>  winged phoenix sterling earrrings  The earrrings were lovely when I looked at them, but they were a gift. The receiver also loved the earrings. They symbolized the University where she graduated as a doctoral candidate. The earrings were perfect. <end>  phoenix pendant and earings  These were really pretty - the silver was nice. Was a bit worried about ordering online for the quality, but they looked awesome. <end>  Very nice earrings  I was pleasantly surprised by the earrings I received. These definitely are a good size -not too big or too small, they have a nice weight to them, and feel and look like good quality jewelry. Happy with my purchase! <end>  Nice but small  I love the pendant for this earring set a lot but was kind of disappointed at how small the earrings were. They are just not as noticeable as I would like under all my hair. If you like small light earrings than these are probably fine for you. Not bad quality just a little more petite than I usually like. <end>  phoenix earings  Small earings but a nice size, not big or gaudy at all. Great quality, as pictured... got these along with the pendant which is also nicely made. <end>  SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT.  BUT STILL GORGEOUS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL ON THEM, TOO. <end>  Pretty especially with necklace  I love these earrings and matching necklace! I get compliments everytime I wear them!They are unique and stand out! They're beautiful. I suggest you put the clear earring safety backsso you do not lose them. <end>
 B0007Q2Z7S  Sterling Silver Black Leather 16" Cord Chain Necklace ||	  didnt last long  after not even a month of having purchased this item. This necklace has already broken. I probably should've looked at purchasing something a little more substantial and will in the future. But for this item and it's brief usage period. I would recommend you look elsewhere for better quality necklaces. Because this one isn't it by a long shot. <end>  A Piece of Trash  I bought two for a yinyang best-friends pendant/s I was giving as a gift. The black cord popped out of the 'silver' setting on one, and the other rusted.This thing's a piece of junk. I wish I hadn't ordered them. I generally avoid condemning reviews like this, trying to find some good things, but with this piece, there really isn't anything 'good' about it. You'd be better off buying a length of silk cord at a crafts shop and knotting the back- save yourself the money and angst of this product.Honestly, it's not even worth one star. <end>  50/50 chance of success  I purchased two of these necklaces, but the first one broke the second time I wore it. Good thing I purchased two. <end>  Feels good so far..  It does the job and holds nicely (for now). I really like the look and feel of this leather cord for the time being. I do have a skinny neck and normally wear my necklaces high, so this works well. Be sure to know how 16" will fit you. <end>  chain  I ordered this necklace for myself. Was unaware that 16" was going to be so short. It is still a nice necklace though. The shipment got to me in a timely manner. <end>  Thicker than I expected  I had a hard time envisioning this as a thick chain, just because it was so short, meant to wear as a choker. I had to pound the clasp out a little bit to get my snake over it, but it stays in place nicely. I don't regret the purchase, I find that it's quality material. I would have preferred it to be just a little thinner. <end>  Cord Necklace  Looks good on men or women. No need to worry about allergies to metal chains. An answer to our problem!! <end>
 B0007QKND6  Rhodium plated and enamel Irish Shamrock cufflinks with presentation box ||	  Nice pair of cufflinks  I ordered the Irish clover cufflink for myself and my father for my wedding. I like the colors and style of this cufflink over other clover styles I've seen. <end>
 B0007QR92O  Live Well, Love Much, Laugh Often Inspirational Message Silver Tone Metal Cuff Bracelet ||	  Be sure to read the fine print  Make sure you read the fine print!This bracelet is silver TONED, not sterling silver. The embossing is also not the greatest - clear on the one side, but hard to see the letters on the other. <end>  Wore 3 days and threw it away.  Actually I only wore it 2 days to work. I took it off at night and put it on in the mornings. On the 3rd day I noticed the silver peeling off. I tossed it. I know it was inexpensive but that was down right cheap. Never again!!!!! <end>  Loving this bracelet  Although I've only had it a few weeks, I have had many compliments and questions on where I got it. It is detailed and solid with a great message. Would recommend it. <end>  great buy for the money  This item can"t be beat for a price point . It is a nice addition to my silver wardrobe.Only problem I encoured was that it is a bit stiff and hurts my wrist at the time of Putting on and taking off, but I am a plus size lady so that may be part of the reason .This is a really neat item , shiny and attetion getting ... <end>  I like it  The bracelet looks more expensive than it is. I like wearing it. <end>  Broken bracelet  I loved this bracelet. It was heavy and beautiful and I loved the saying on it. Unfortunately, since it's a cuff and I had to pull it a bit to take it off (you have to open it a little to get it on and off and tighten it when you get it on so that it doesn't fall off but that's normal with cuff bracelets), it actually broke in half the first day that I wore it and was taking it off. I didn't think that I pulled it that hard so it seems to me that it broke pretty easily. It's a beautiful bracelet but you have to be careful with it. <end>  Not worth the shipping  When I got this bracelet, I tried to make it a bit larger before putting it on and it snapped and broke in half. It is pot metal covered with a silver coating. Junk! <end>  I love this bracelet  I love this bracelet. The message fits my personality and I am always getting compliments on it. People always want to look at it. From the price I knew it would be silver toned, not real silver. Despite this, its very cute, particularly the writing and a year later my bracelet still looks great. <end>  Get one for yourself.  I bought this for myself- as a visible reminder while I waited for surgery. Putting it on helped even more during recovery.It is just the right size- not too heavy, not too thin. Everyone wants a closer look when I have it on. <end>  Cute.  Made a nice Christmas gift for my roommate who loves the saying. Cute product. Came just as advertised. Thank you. <end>  Nice  This is a fun bracelet, it's not silver but silver tone so it turns my skin green, so I just wash my wrist  ) It is a little small, I chose to keep it anyway. I like it. <end>  great seller  Just as shown in the photo, no surprises. I bought it as a gift and it couldn't have been better <end>  bracelets  Very lovely for a good price and came less then a week after I ordered it with standard mail. Was very impressed <end>  excellent  Jewelry&watches;Live well...You'll be always in a high spirit if you purchase this bracelet.It's a really good gift for your friends. <end>  Stunning  I bought this as a gift for a dear friend. She loved it and has worn it often. <end>  I love it  I love it!! I bought one for me and one for my bestfriend. really solid, heavy material, not cheap at all <end>  Crappy  this product was pretty crappy...if you wear it once or twice it will be fine. but my mom wore it for a couple of weeks and the silver finish wore off to this weird rusty under. Not a very good product if you want it to last. <end>  Great gift  I bought this as a present for a friend and she loved it. It's a great inspirational message I think we should all try and keep in mind. It arrived promptly and in a velvet bag that added to the presentation. <end>  Pretty cool!  I first got a really heavy one and it split! I wrote to them, and they were WONDERFUL!! They never doubted my honesty, and then sent another one that was way lighter--and bends great! It still gets caught in people's hair when I hug them, though--ha ha! I like it a lot! <end>  They are wonderful !!!  I purchased 6 bracelets as gifts for my daughter and her friends for Valentine's Day. They loved them and so do I. <end>  PERFECT CHOICE  This bracelet is the perfect choice for anyone who needs a bit of inspiration and encouragement in life. The quality of this lovely bit of jewelry shows. Arriving in a lovely velvet bag, this beautiful silver bracelet will enhance the wrist of your favourite person and give them the perfect mantra for life. <end>  Most excellent customer service!!  This item came packaged very professionally with a velvet black bag and great little box that fit in my mailbox...yea..no visiting the window!I had a problem with the item and the seller took care of the problem way, way, way above and beyond my expectations. I was "wowed" and that is a rare experience these days.Buy from them! <end>  Exactly what I expected  When this product came it was exactly what I expected. The bracelet is a little heavier though, which was a pleasant surprise. It didn't feel like a cheap piece of jewelry. I gave it as a present to my sister, and she loved it. <end>  no product received  I did not receive product. I contacted the seller twice and never heard from them <end>
 B0007R8T1I  3mm Sterling Silver 18" Bead or Ball Chain Necklace ||	  Great Necklace  Really nice ball and bead necklace. Silver is great in quality, and construction of piece is the best. The necklace has a great feeling when being worn. Does not collect your hair or cause any discomfort. Very satisfied. <end>  I Love this Chain!  I ordered a sterling silver BB Ball chain from Amazon.com, and boy did it come in quick! Thanx a lot! I Am One Satisfied customer! <end>  Necklace  Necklace is decent. Did however attempt communication to seller to purchase another one, a different size, and never heard back. <end>
 B0007R8T2M  3mm Sterling Silver 22" Bead or Ball Chain Necklace ||	  Item as described  This necklace has a nice weight to it and arrived promptly even though shipped to Canada. The only reason why I am giving it four stars instead of five is that my husband feels that it looks "cheap." Too bad - I liked it but now don't want to wear it as much! <end>  Not exactly what I expected  Unless every ruler in my house is wrong, the measurements of this chain are not accurately reported. The beads are 2mm rather than 3mm... Is it the end of the world? No, I didn't send the necklace back, but I would have preferred what 3mm which is what I thought I was ordering. Also with the clasp included, the necklace is a little longer than 22". Had I known all this, I would have ordered a larger bead size and a shorter chain length. <end>
 B0007R8T3Q  Rhodium Plated Sterling Silver White CZ Circle of Life Pendant 16" Necklace - Red Gift Box Included ||	  wow  save few thousand and get this heart...in stead of the real thing...you will never know the diff..... <end>
 B0007RJQFG  Platinum Channel Set Round Brilliant Diamond Engagement Ring Setting (3/8 ct tw, I, I1) ||	  Good work!!!!!!!!!!  All I can say is its as described and a better price for a similar thing outside.I am happy!!!!! Shipping was fast and I had it in about four days..will get again from Amazon, when I am ready to spend that kind of money.  -)...Definitely saved a few hundreds,shopping on Amazon. <end>
 B0007RMIN8  Platinum Classic Solitaire Engagement Ring Setting ||	  Good Platinum Solitare Setting  I'm not exactly sure how to review an engagement ring setting, but here goes. Its a fairly affordable platinum setting. I bought it as part of the engagement ring for my (now) fiancee. The setting is shiny and heavy just like it should be. Its a little bit on the heavy side, which is a side effect of choosing platinum rather than white gold, but it won't dull as much. My only complaint is that Amazon didn't offer rings in quarter sizes. However, rounding to the nearest half-size didn't make a big difference and the ring looks great on my fiancee's finger. <end>  Great Ring  This is a very nice ring. It is very shiny, and also very $$. Very cool. <end>
 B0007RMKL8  18k Yellow Gold Cathedral Engagement Ring Setting ||	  Great setting if your stone is large enough.  I bought this for my fiance, thinking it would just be a temporary ring and she would pick something else later, but as it turns out she loves it and is keeping it. It is a very striking ring, big enough to look good with a larger stone, and her rock sits up and catches the light beautifully! (She said yes!) <end>
 B0007RMPKE  14k White Gold Cathedral Engagement Ring Setting ||	  Very nice!  The problem with online shopping is that you can't be sure what you are getting until you see it in your hands, no matter how detailed the description that they give is. The ring is not what I imagined but still nice. The setting is beautifully made, fairly heavy and has a substantial amount of gold. The metal is smooth and shiny. I bought a tiny .27 carat diamond to go with it, and I feel that the setting kind of overwhelms the diamond. The ring is still pretty but if I were shopping at jewelry store, I might choose a different setting or a bigger diamond. But there is just no way you can get this kind of price from a jewelry store. Overall, I am quite satisfied with my purchase. <end>
 B0007RTW3C  Straight Poker Hand Ace of Spades Jeweled Dangle Belly Ring ||	  body jewelry review  The shipping and packaging were excellent however the jewelry fell apart the very first time i wore it, i had it fixed and it fell aparta second time in less than a week. It is probably an isolated incident and i would stillbuy from them again but it was a shame, te piece was adorable. Wish i could have worn it. <end>
 B0007RTW6Y  Clear Acrylic 100 Dollar Casino Chip Belly Ring ||	  Bottom doesn't screw on properly  This looked so cute online, but it's not as pretty in person. The white spaces are really a sort of dirty cream color. Also, the bottom doesn't really screw on firmly, which makes me worry that it would come off if I tried to wear it. Definitely not worth the money. <end>
 B0007RTWH8  Dazzling Green Gem Martini Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Broken Belly Ring  After 4 days of wearing the belly ring it broke! The Martini fell off of the actual ring. I am very disappointed! <end>
 B0007RXLUW  14k White Gold Pear-Cut Sapphire Engagement Ring Setting (1/3 ct tw) ||	  Stunning  I had a pear shaped .41 ct Diamond placed in this setting over a year ago. I wanted a ring that stood out from the rest and had a little color to it. I get compliments all the time and I could not be more happy with my beautiful ring. When I am bored, waiting for appointments and such, I sit and watch the light play off the Sapphires and Diamond. The deep blue Sapphires seem to make the Diamond literally GLOW bright white. All I can say is that it is a truly beautiful setting for people who want a little personality to their engagement ring without being tacky. <end>
 B0007S5IFW  Fuchsia Swarovski Crystal Flower Brooch ||	  Beautiful Brooch  I own this beautiful brooch and I just love it. The quality and style are wonderful- stylish, yet classic. I get stopped on the street whenever I wear it. Everyone loves it! <end>
 B0007SV77U  Pugster 22k Golden Plated April Birthstone Lily Flower Clear White Swarovski Crystal Diamond Accent Brooches And Pins ||	  Not impressed  The brooch was cheap because it is. The overall quality of the brooch isn't the best and the colors are dark and the crystals aren't brilliant. Two of the crystals were not set properly. <end>
 B0007SV7BQ  Pugster Vintage Dangle Pearl Bowknot With Clear Swarovski Crystal Diamond Accent Brooches & Pins ||	  Love it  I love this pin. It is very pretty and a nice size. I wish it didnt cost so much but it is very nice, cant wait to wear it! <end>
 B0007SV7D4  Pugster Birth Venus Photo Italian Charm ||	  Love It  This link has been added to my charm link bracelet to remind me of the birth & love of my children. Each piece added can have personal meaning to your life. <end>
 B0007TAHU2  Sterling Silver Genuine Black Peacock Pearl Necklace ||	  not my usual rating for Silver Insanity  The necklace appeared luminous and colorful in the picture. It did not look as colorful as I thought it would be. The beads are strung very tightly on the necklace which distorts the shape. The necklace doesn't lay flat and smooth against my neck. I have purchased several items from this seller and this is the first time I have been disappointed. <end>  The picture is deceiving  There are no measurements in the description and I thought this was going to be a longer necklace. It's more like a choker than the long one I was hoping it would be. But still very pretty. Please add the measurements Amazon. <end>  great value  great basic string of pearls, wonderful price.The pearls have a strong greenish-blue cast, which is pretty. <end>  A little small  The advertisement is deceiving. One line states between 6-7mm, and another states 5.5-7mm. The stones are definately a 5.5. or smaller. That is no problem as long as you are expecting that. I was hoping for some larger pearls and did not get them. The color and brillance are pretty though as long as you have a magnifying glass! <end>  Not as round  The pearls are not as round as pictured but the egg shape doesn't detract from the overall beauty of the necklace. I think it makes it kind of unique. I'm not sure the pearls hit the 7mm mark but they are still a nice size and the colors are stunning. <end>
 B0007U07HE  CARE BEARS Good Luck Bear Belly Ring Officially Licensed ||	  care bear belly ring  I love my Care Bear belly ring. My daughter loves care bears and would tell me I needed Good Luck bear. Well, I saw this ring and decided to get it. My daughter loves when I wear it and I like it too. It is very cute and at such a good price. <end>
 B0007UBL4C  Passion Pink Gem Dreamcatcher Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Pretty but not durable  Bought a few of these belly button pieces and this one lasted one day too. The dreamcatcher fell off which I found but couldn't be put back on. I still use the remaining piece. They need to make the rings holding the dangles alot stronger so this doesnt keep happening <end>
 B0007UZ3FA  From the Heart Keepsake Box - 26601 by Willow Tree ||	  Heart Box  You can never have enough keepsake boxes. This is a great box for earrings, rings, etc. It was given as a gift. <end>  Keepsake Box by Willow Tree a true Keepsake  I love this box. I gave it to my daughter in law as a gift and she loved it too. I put a small pair of earrings in it. I love the willow tree items so this was a nice way to have one that is as useful as it is beautiful. <end>
 B0007VBRQI  Mens Sterling Silver Celtic Knot CROSS Ring Size 12.5 ||	  Nice ring  This ring is very nice and strong. Though the sizes are wrong on the ad, and the company gave me misinformation, I ordered it anyway, the ring came in size 10, not 9.5 or 10.5 as in the ad. But as for the ring, it is well built and will hold up well and you will not be dissapointed. <end>
 B0007VJ03A  Giorno - Hammered Two Tone Comfort Fit Wedding Band Custom Made! ||	  So pleased I bought 2!  My husband and I both bought bands from this company. I got his too big and he lost it, until I got him another one, then he found it. But the point is he liked the band so much he wanted the same one reordered. <end>
 B0007W5P7Y  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Round Pink Topaz Solitaire 3mm Band Ring Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  I Love This Ring!!!  I have fallen in love with this ring. Absolutely gorgeous. A stunner. I got this in a size 7 and it fits perfectly. The pink topaz is so sparkly. The silver looks expensive and matches the pink so well. This ring looks very high quality. I can't believe that I got this ring for such a low price. I think this is a fantastic value. I haven't taken this ring off since I got it this morning. <end>  Lovely  The ring is very pretty--a good size (neither "flashy" nor too small). The stone is sparkly and the overall appearance is that of a much more expensive item. <end>  Pretty ring  This ring is really pretty and shiny. Do not hesitate to buy it. You will not be disappointed. I wear it on my middle finger and it looks so nice especially in the light. <end>  Not what I expected, but still beautiful  When I ordered this ring, I expected a possibility of cheap metal, and a pink stone. The quality of metal I received was quite nice. However, the stone was not pink at all, it looks like a faux diamond/CZ. If you don't mind not getting the color expected, I would say go for it. This ring has held up, while wearing it everyday and even not taking it off when I shower, it shows no signs of ware, the band looks great and the stone is set very securely! Great quality! <end>  Cute Ring  I wanted a pink ring, and for the price, I couldn't argue with this. It's a nice ring, it's pretty and it fits well. I immediately thought when I took it out of the box that it was plastic and not metal. I can't really attest to the quality of the band, and I don't have a problem with metals so I can't tell you there either. The stone is a clear light pink and it's pretty. I wouldn't call it really sparkly. It has a nice, clear look, but it doesn't have a ton of sparkle. But.. what do you want for $8? I'm not head over heels, but I'm not disappointed either. It's nice for the cost. If you want something cheap for everyday use, or something for a younger girl that will look pretty but is cheap, this is a good choice. Definitely classier than what you find for the same price at a big-box store.[Update] The ring is cute, but be careful with it. I'm not sure what happened to mine, but I came upon it one day totally crushed and bent, and unable to be fixed. The metal is just that thin and cheap that it can easily be bent out of shape. I've never had that happen before to a ring. I'll be replacing it with a different pink ring.Lowered from 4 stars to 3. <end>
 B0007W6CH6  Cabana Beach Ball Tongue Ring ||	  Didn't like it  Item cracked and broke after only about 3 days of wearing it, it was cheaply made and a waste of money. <end>  plain and normal  this was a very plain and normal tongue ring but it was exactly what i wanted i didnt want anything fancy just something with good colors and nothing big and thats exactly what i got... <end>
 B0007W7IY2  Sterling Silver Round Cut Aquamarine Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Band 3mm Ring Size 5,6,7,8,9,10 ||	  Warning for other buyers  I bought this ring just for ring size testing, so the quality is not a problem for me. But there are something about this ring and it's center stone that i think i should let other buyers know in advance. I highly doubt the material is CZ(Cubic Zirconia). Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4. For those who does not know what i was talking about, let's put it this way  The center stone does not sparkle at all and it looks cloudy...I guess i wont return it since it is very cheap... <end>  Stunning!  I plan on taking some pictures of this ring because the one picture for the description is beautiful but leaves a lot to the imagination.The blue isn't as green as the picture shows, and it's a little lighter, but it's otherwise very close to the color shown. It's a very beautiful ring! The silver is stunningly bright and shiny. Size is perfect. The stone is very high, though, which is hard to tell from the picture. But I've never had a solitaire ring with a rock this big, so I bet that it has to be this tall.All in all, it's an absolutely beautiful ring, especially considering the price. <end>  SOOOOOOOOO FUNNY!  I actually bought this to wait until my actual engagement ring came in. I have to tell you everyone loved this ring SO much I returned my engagement ring and kept it! Of course I did not tell them the price LOL! When it needs to be cleaned i put it in some sea salt and it comes out beautiful , with great fire! <end>
 B0007XW7QU  PalmBeach Jewelry Multi-Color Mother-Of-Pearl Sterling Silver Daisy Ring Sizes 7-12 ||	  not what i expected  this ring is over price first is not like in the picture one stone is missing and i just open the box really cheap made this is going back for sure <end>  nice piece at a great value  This piece looks as good in person as it does in the picture. It is heavy and my wife loved it. <end>  Cute Summertime Ring  I got this ring for our summer vacation. It is so cute! I get so many complements on it. I got it for my index finger. It is a great size for that. I do not think I would like it for my ring finger due to the size and shape. Plus it shows off better on my index finger. <end>
 B0007Y9O3I  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Teardrop Shaped Aquamarine Cubic Zirconia Marcasite Band Polished Finish Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Stunning!!!  Product was better than pictured! It was a gift that went over extremely well. Much nicer than I could ever have imagined for the price. Will buy from them over-and-over again. WOW! <end>  wonderful ring  The picture of this ring does not do it justice, It is beautiful and has already mistaken for a much more expensive look alike I buy from them a lot and am always pleased!!!! <end>  dirty center stone!  Got this for a friend for Christmas but will be returning it for a different one because not only is the center stone dirty (underneath the left side of the stone), but also some of the surrounding stones or whatever they are, are dull and don't shine/sparkle like the other ones. Just three or four of them, but the ring itself looks already used. Also the stone is a little lighter than in the picture but I can deal with that. Overall it is a beautiful ring, but I just wanted a nice, CLEAN, new ring to give to my friend for Christmas. And nobody should have to specify they want something clean hen they're ordering it new! I'd understand if I bought this used off of some website like eBay, but amazon? Come on! Amazon is going to lose me as a loyal customer if they keep this crap up! I shouldn't have to return an item for being dirty! I am thou roughly disgusted and would give it ZERO stars if I could! <end>  Lovely!  This ring is really stunning! It looks much more expensive then the actual price. The seller is wonderful, ships in a timely manner and the rings come in a little case with a bow on top. This would make a great gift for anyone or even just for yourself. <end>  My girlfriend was moved to tears.  This ring was so worth the price. The local jewelry store had one that was identical for $150 dollars MORE!! That was all she wanted for her birthday..But we're on a fixed income. Low and behold I find it here. She was so happy that she cried a little. This made her day and I have these guys to thank for it. Thanks for everything. <end>  Beautiful Blue Ring  This ring is realy special. The contrass with the marcasite and rich aqua blue is stunning. The aqua stone looks completely real (like a london blue topaz). The nice thing is the ring can be worn pointing up or down giving it two distinct looks. It's a fantastic value for the price and really pops in person, as with all Gem Avenue jewelry the picture doesn't do it justice (their jewelry is just gorgeous). <end>  Beautiful ring  I have ordered jewelry from Gem Avenue many times and have never been disappointed. Their jewelry is lovely, high quality and affordable. The ring looks the same as in the picture. I highly recommend Gem Avenue. <end>  Sterling silver teardrop ring  tdrmz-5000aq-5 Nickel Free .925 Sterling Silver Teardrop Shaped Aquamarine Cubic Zirconia Marcasite Band Polished Finished Ring is prettier in person. i love my ring and every one that sees it love it. You should get one for yourself,Seller is very nice,and ships fast. Seller AAAA++++ <end>  Absolutely gorgeous !  I ordered this ring on a whim, simply because I love aquamarine and marcasite both. I was SO happy I did. It is one of the most BEAUTIFUL rings I have ever owned, and I'm SO very, very happy I bought it.....it's a treasure !! <end>  beautiful ring  the setting size and clarity of the stone is amazing. i was really impresed with this ring. i thought it was gonna be cheap looking based onthe price but it isnt. my boyfriend chose a great gift for our one year anniversary. i love this ring <end>  What a beautiful ring!  My daughter had been hunting for a birthstone ring for years that she liked. When she saw the picture of this ring she just loved it. When we received this ring we were blown away with how beautiful it is in person! This is amazing quality for the price and it looks awesome! She is showing it off to everyone now! <end>  gorgeous ring!  The ring is even more beautiful than the picture! I get so many compliments on it! <end>  It's ok  The ring is ok. The one i recieved was pretty dull. The stone was cloudy and looked like plastic. Everything about the ring is nice except the stone. The lavender has a much better stone so i would suggest buying that one instead. <end>  Got What I Paid For  It was pretty, cheap, had good reviews, so I bought it. I've had it for a few months now, and all the Marcasite stones have fallen out. However, I also wear it every day. Other than that, it's still pretty. The size was pretty accurate, just a little big. I would buy it again for the price I paid on it, probably. It's a cute ring. Just don't expect it to last over six months if you plan on wearing it every day.KST. <end>  This ring was a HUGE hit.  I bought this for my girlfriend based on the other Amazon reviews and was not disappointed. It is a beautiful ring and she absolutely *loved* it. <end>  Beautiful Ring  This is a very nice ring for the money. The stone is larger than I thought but it is not gaudy. I am very happy with this purchase. It was a birthday present to myself..very pleased! <end>  lovely! (and wonderfully affordable)  I am so excited about this ring!I literally just pulled it out of the box and rushed to give it an awesome review!The service was very fast, also.And the ring is lovely. <end>  beautiful  this is an absolutely beautiful piece. i figured it was worth "risking it" for the price, and it was a well-rewarded risk. it's very finely0-designed. the stone is clear and a beautiful colour. <end>  Very pleased with this purchase  This marcasite, aquamarine and cz ring was a gift for my sister and she loved it! It is a very nice ring especially for the price. <end>  Excellent Buy!  This is a very nice ring and looks like something 3 or 4 times the price. Yes, the image makes the stone unnaturally blue, but in reality, the stone is exactly how it is supposed to look! I gave it as a gift to a young girl and she said it was the prettiest ring she has ever received and wears it constantly!The delivery was fast and it comes in a nice box, so don't hesitate if you like the look - it really IS a nice, solid, well-set ring! (I have a lot of very expensive jewelry and this ring would not look out of place with my collection!) <end>  The Picture Doesn't Do It Justice  When I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful this ring is. When I gave it to my wife on Christmas, she wasmore than delighted. This ring is truly a well crafted design. Unlike a lot of jewelry, it is one of a kind. <end>  Really Pretty Ring  This ring is so pretty, my daughter loves it and she is really fussy. I love this ring and will be buying one for myself. Gem Ave has never failed to impress me with their jewelry and great service.(Or their great prices) I have bought several things from them and have never been disapointed. <end>  Great gift!  I purchased this ring for my sister for our birthday because blue is her favorite color. The only negative thing I would say about the ring is that it is not as blue as in the image. However, it is still a beautiful ring and was a great gift for my sister, she really loved it. <end>
 B0007YASZG  Sterling Silver Italian Horn Lucky Thirteen 13 Charm Bracelet 7" ||	  Over Priced  This is adorable, I have only been able to find it here and on another sight for twice the price. That said After only having it for a few months several of the charms had fallen off and been lost, I am purchasing another one I am not happy but this is the only place i can find anything like this.  /Here is an update I purchased the second one which also fell apart after only a short time, I have enough of the charms between the two of them now to create one, and will be bringing the two of the to a local jewelry crafter and having her make my a new one <end>  not really happy  The bracelet was cute, however the packing was terrible. The bracelet almost fell out of the box when I received it. Also, it was not long enough. I feel like I overpaid for this product. <end>
 B0007YT500  Emerald and Bronze Colored Multistrand Beaded Collar Necklace ||	  GREEN SHIMMER!  WOW....The picture does not do this justice. It's a beautiful bead necklace with gorgeous color. I was so pleased when I opened my package and saw it. The craftmanship is excellent! And the price is so reasonable. I can't wait to wear it! <end>  So happy  I ordered this piece and am very happy I did. I get nothing but compliments when I wear it. Thanks. <end>  Plastic Beads  Full of plastic-looking plastic beads! Granted the necklace is cheap, but the plastic spacers spoil an otherwise nice piece of jewelry. <end>  Horrible smelling  I got this the other day and really was pleased with the way that it looked when I opened the package. I had to put it on right away. I was only able to wear it for maybe 1/2 an hour before I couldn't anymore, you see it has a really weird, bad odor to it. As I was taking it off the extender broke in half and then the next thing you know there was beads flying off from the necklace. So needless to say at first I thought this necklace was great because it looks so cute, but it is so cheaply made, and that smell is gross. Just goes to show that looks can be deceiving. If I were you I wouldn't waste money on this. I am sending it back because I don't feel it's fair to pay $10 for something that pretty much instantaneously broke. <end>  piece of junk...  This necklace looks gorgeous in the photograph... The bronze colored beads are made of nothing more than plastic with a colored coating on them that chips right off. The quality of the workmanship is not bad...but the materials are definitely not of a quality that I would wear out of the house. The item can be found on the NVie Website for $9.99...there is no way that this or any other NVie item could have been originally priced at close to $50...as Amazon claims. I have terriffic luck with Amazon products...but this one was definitely a "downer" and I hope to be refunded. <end>
 B0007YVB6G  Onyx Colored Pendant Necklace W/wood and Bone Beads [Limited Time Blowout Offer] ||	  You get what you pay for!!!!  I received my necklace in a very timely manner. The concept was terrific and I love the look. The chain however is CHEAP and takes away from the necklace. It could never exact the original price but for the "blow-out" price; I can not complain. <end>  looks good from a distance....  For the dirt cheap price I paid for this, I recieved just what I expected (for only $7.00) Many of the beads are plastic, and its not a peice that you will expect to last a life time. But it is a cute, trendy accessory that looks just fine with casual wear. <end>  Crappy  YUCK...poor quality, bad chain will turn your neck green, poor workmanship on the pendant...oh and it's painted black...not even worth 1.00...don't buy <end>  Big pendant yet so elegant  This is my favorite! It will look very elegant on you if you know the right color and style of clothes to match with. You will look modern and classic at the same time with this stylish necklace. <end>  cheap  I liked the necklace it was pretty, but it broke the first day i wore it. I tried to fix it but i think i t is unrepairable... <end>
 B0007YYFU0  Synthetic Amethyst and Opal Sterling Silver Dragonfly Pendant ||	  Beautiful Dragonfly!  Upon receipt of this product I was in love with it immediately. It is gorgeous! I am very happy with the quality of the piece and would definitely order from them again. <end>  What a beauty  I just received this pendant and I have to say it is lovely. When I open a package and the first thing out of my mouth is "ooooh" that's a pretty good indication that I am pleased. I love dragonfly jewelry and this is such a unique piece and much nicer than it's photo. I recommend it to anyone searching for a well made magical pendant. <end>  so delicate and pretty  got this today, it's so feminine and delicate, not tiny nor big, just right and it's so shiny. It's great for everyday wear and just a great little pendant, the wings are beautiful and it has a nice weight to it. <end>

This ring is very beautiful, sparkly and shiny! Looks like the real thing! Top quality!!!! <end>  Beautiful and durable.  This is an awesome looking ring. My family and friends love it as well as I . Not only is it very nice to look at but it is also made well. It will give me and all who see it many years of gazing enjoyment. <end>  lovely  I was a bit trepidatious about buying jewelry online, but this proved my fears unfounded. It was really beautiful in person. I bought it as a gift for a friend. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the presentation. It came in a tiny plastic ring box which I felt looked very cheap. I bought a real leather ring gift box to present it to my friend, it made it look ten times better. <end>  Great Ring!  I love this ring! My birthstone is Ruby and it appeared that color in the picture. When it arrived, it has a slightly more pink tone, however, it is still very nice and I like it. I ordered a size 8 for a thin thumb ring and it was a perfect fit. Fast shipping and great service. I will most definitely buy from this seller again! <end>

 B0007Z6TIK  Sterling Silver And Peridot Hoop Earrings By Zina ||	  Great Birthstone Earrings for me CDG  These are great! I like the color and especially the price!!! At first I thought they would be to small and I would have to give them to one of my nieces, but they open up and slip on your ear and magnificent fit! I will have to order my nieces their own in their birthstone color. This is a sturdy piece of sterling silver and I like it. I will order more from this company and go through Amazon.com to do it! Thanks to you both for a very good quality product. <end>
 B0007ZBM0K  Amazon.com  C3 Corvette Sterling Silver Toe Ring 1  Clothing ||	  Corvette toe ring  Hard to purchase something like this on line.

 B0007ZDCPS  Nickel Free No Tarnish Sterling Silver Aquamarine Cubic Zirconia Princess cut Eternity 3mm Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  aquamarine cz band  As in the other rings of same style from same vendor, I am very disappointed. The stones fall out immediately on first wear and they are not brilliant as one would like. Can not clean them as the silver goes dark, and since there is silver between each stone the ring is dull. I wore each of the 4 (diff colors) I purchased only once. So I would consider these disposable rings and will not be purchasing from this vendor again. <end>
 B0007ZDV0Y  Sterling Silver Border Terrier Dog Pendant ||	  Border Terriersilver pendant  SOOOO cute and even more special since we have now received our 2 Border Terrier puppies, 9 weeks old.

 B0007ZHG8C  Sterling Silver Borzoi Dog Pendant ||	  Not A Borzoi  This is an Afghan hound depicted with a Borzoi tail it is pretty bad. This looks nothing like a Borzoi. You might improve your marketing and therefore, selling strategies, by correctly identifying your product. Maybe just call it "Dog"? For the folks surfing - this not a Borzoi in any way. <end>
 B0007ZN0OG  Tagliamonte Classics Collection - Pearls & Rubies 18K Gold Ring USA 9.5 | UK S | IT 20 ||	  Not well made for the price.  For an item that is so expensive, this ring is not as well made as I would have expected. Specifically, the side "columns" are not even in length. Also, the cab rubies are not uniform in color. I just had the feeling that I was paying more for the name of the designer than for the quality of the ring. <end>

 B00080MYQ0  Three Stone Antique Look Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  Great If You Don't Plan To Wear It Often  It's beautiful and I get many people tell me how pretty it is, but after you wear it a couple of weeks, it leaves a black mark around your finger that doesn't wash completely off for several days. <end>
 B00080O02Q  Gorgeous! Black Hills Gold and Sterling-Silver Yellow-gold Ladies Elongated Ring ||	  Customer  I bought this ring and the picture does not due it justice.

 B00081OZJI  Pink CZ Rings - 0.70 Carat Pink Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  THE PERFECT COLOR PINK  I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON "PINK" RINGS-AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET ONE THAT DOES'T HAVE A NASTY YELLOW GLOW-UNLESS YOU GO TO A PINK DIAMOND(AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT)-WELL I HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL ESTATE PINK BAND WITH A SOFT PINK COLOR(NO YELLOW) AND I SAW THIS-GOT IT-NOW HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WEDDING SET THAT LOOKS LIKE PINK DIAMONDS.I LOVE THIS RING.IF YOU REALLY KNOW PINK RINGS AND WANT A REAL PINK WITHOUT THE YELLOW GLARE=THIS IS IT.JUST GORGEOUS.THANKS FOR SUCH A NICE RING THAT I COULD AFFORD. <end>  Nice ring, stone is a bit darker then the photo  This is a nice ring. The stone is darker in color then what showed on my monitor. The previous reviewer mentioned pink stones that look yellow - this is my first piece with a pink stone and I would say it is a true "pink" that if anything leans towards purple in color. The quality is high and the stone sparkles. <end>
 B00081R4QE  Jessica Simpson Replica CZ Wedding Band ||	  Does not rate a star  I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of quality on this time. Within less than 3 weeks of wearing the ring, one of the CZ stones already fell out of its setting. Prior to that, I noticed that within the 1st week of wearing the ring, some of the stones were already loose within their settings. <end>  Save your money  Within a week of wearing the ring the biggest stone fell out. Was really disappointed because for the price the ring looked pretty good. <end>  What can you expect?  For $19.49, you get that much quality...basically none. And Jessica is only trying to make more and more money with cheap rings. Save you money until you can buy a more decent ring that looks a lot better. <end>  My 9 yr old has better rings !  Although this ring is very pretty on screen ~ Buyer Beware ! In person it is cheap looking and a couple of the stones are crooked, I have not bothered to send it back ~ not worth the aggravation ~ my 9 yr old uses it to play dress-up (she has better looking dress-up rings in her collection - need I say more !) <end>  Fabulous and Classy look! GREAT Customer Service !  This ring is just gorgeous and looks completely real. I have gotten so many compliments on it! The only catch is that the manufacturer decided to make the newer version of this same ring, with smaller diamonds. I ordered another ring for a friend and received this scaled down diamond version. I sent it back requesting the old (bigger diamond) version like the one I already own...LET ME STRESS THIS, Customer Service is OUTSTANDING. They quickly responded to my request and shipped the older version ring to me with no problems. So if you want the new version, the diamonds are smaller (just as beautiful, just not what I wanted) If the old version is available, I highly recommend it. <end>
 B00081US76  Silver Plated Purse Mirror ||	  Great product  This was a great product for the price! I bought 7 of these mirrors for my husband's administrative staff and took them to be engraved.

 B000848D84  Sterling Silver Yellow CITRINE Poison Locket Ring size 5.5(Size 4.5) ||	  SS Yellow Citrine Poison Box Ring  The seller was very slow to respond (minus 1 star) to my email (days). I actually ordered the ring before I received a response.The citrine stone is light but it is clear and shiny. The stone is more yellow than the picture shows. However, I wanted it more on the yellow side. The silver is nice and shinny and not antiqued like the picture shows. The quality of the ring is great and it is very pretty. It is true to size.It arrived on time and it was packaged well. I have shared this sellers site with many friends. Great prices and great quality. <end>  Attention Grabber!  I received this item off of a wishlist I had created for graduation and I love it. The picture can be a tad misleading because the Citrine is actually very, very light (like a watered-down apple juice) but it's still pretty.Every time I wear it, without fail, people always stop to tell me how much they like it. It makes your hands look very delicate and feminine, which is nice the ring is a nie weight and size  it's not to bulky and it doesn';t have a tendency to catch on things.I give this ring 4.5 out of 5 because the picture is misdleading, but otherwise it ROCKS! <end>  Sterling Silver Yellow Citrine Poison Box Ring  I'm very satisfied with this ring. the descriptions match the actual product. The reason why I gave this review 4 out of 5 is because the shipment was 5 days late, but other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase. <end>  not as it looks in the pic  the product looks great in the pic, but actually it is toooo small and the material looks cheap and you can bend it with your 2 fingers. <end>  Just treat it gently?  I love the ring, I had some trouble with the stone coming out of it but the seller was very nice and replaced the ring. I really can't complain. And for the price I would still recommend the ring and I would most definately recommend the seller, "Silver Insanity". They shipped very quickly as well. The ring is slightly smaller but brighter than you may think from the pics. And it runs true to size. <end>

I ring is attractive, was a great price, was delivered on time;all and all, it surpassed my expectations. <end>
 B00084UA0I  Sterling Silver Dolphin Ring ||	  dolphin ring  This product was great. I got it for my daughter as a graduation gift and she absolutely loves it. Shipped out very quickly as well. I'd order again for sure. <end>  It's not as solid as seen online  Quick delivery. Just not as solid as seen online. It's highly polished, but it's not worth $26. Beautiful though. <end>  Dolphin ring  This ring is as highly polished and well proportioned (we've all seen BAD dolphin rings, I'm sure) as it appears. So, it's lovely. The only problem I have with it is for the price it's very light weight. The photo doesn't show that the underneath of the dolphin is hollow so I was disappointed with that surprise.. again, for the price. However, as I said, the up side is is that it's a lovely ring, my daughter likes it and Eve's Addiction does a quick delivery with a lovely velvet bag and pretty box too. <end>
 B00084W6VY  Sterling Silver Peace Sign Necklace with Pave Cubic Zirconia ||	  Fine Piece of Jewelry  This peace sign pendant is a fine piece of jewelry. I ordered one for my daughter for Christmas. I wanted more, but they went out of stock. I shall be ordering one for myself and one for my daughter's best friend in the near future. Very impressive and classy! <end>  Love the necklace  I love this necklace. It was just what I was looking for. Every time I wear it people comment on it. <end>

 B00084WHV8  White Pave Cubic Zirconia and Sterling Silver Belt Ring ||	  White pave Cubic Zirconia Belt Buckle Ring  Design is lovely. Bold with lots of sparkle. The down side is, it's starting to lose it's finish. I've tried cleaning it to no avail. If it gets much worse, it will be time for the garbage can. <end>
 B00084Y89C  Lustrous Pearl and Sterling Silver Drop Earrings ||	  Beautiful  These earrings are beautiful. I bought them as a Mother's Day gift and my mom loves them! <end>  Beautiful!  These earrings were very beautiful and very nice for the money. I gave them to my aunt as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loved them. <end>  very large pearls  the earrings were pretty, but the pearl was much larger than shown. And, the pearl looked shiny and painted. I returned them. <end>  Lovely, but large  I bought these for my bridesmaids to wear for my wedding. At first I was displeased at the oversized pearls, however, the girls loved them and since they wore no jewelry on their necks the size turned out to be perfect. They all looked stunning! <end>  not great  These are too big for a person my size to wear comfortably. I got the earings hoping to cut the stud off and wear them on a necklace, but they are still too big. Besides the size the color is a bit dull... about what you can expect for $30 pearls. I had them on my wishlist forever, right after I bought them at full price they went on sale  ( <end>  christmas gift  My husband bought me these and the ring for Christmas and I LOVE them both. <end>
 B00084Y89M  9mm White Freshwater Pearl and Sterling Silver Stud Earrings ||	  great value  I wished I bought the smaller pair. That said, these are beautiful and a great value. <end>
 B00084Y8A6  Sterling Silver Bali Chain and Turtle Necklace ||	  Necklace Addition Info  I liked the product but it the legs were too free-lance which made it noicey when walking or running and did not like the sounds so it wouldn't be worn as much. If the legs were still it would be perfect and the silver looks a bit dirty but can be cleaned <end>  Beautiful Necklace  This is a beautiful necklace with a sturdy chain my 4 year old wore it for a long time without it breaking. The turtle is well crafted. <end>  Beautiful and sturdy necklace!  We bought this for a teacher appreciation gift! She loved it! It is how it appears...very pleased with it. <end>
 B00084ZDHI  Sterling Silver Ring with Dangle Heart - 9 ||	  Very cute ring  I bought this ring for my teenage niece and she love it. It is perfect for a teen or someone who doesn't like big jewelry. She wears it all the time. <end>  Dangle Heart Ring  The O ring that holds the charm on has already broken off and is now unwearable and the charm was lost when this happened since I didn't know when or where it happened. I really liked it until this happened. It really didn't seem that fragile. <end>
 B0008G2D8S  Three Dimensional Northwest Tribal Eagle Pendant for Men or Women in Sterling Silver, #2616 ||	  Beautiful!  This was my first order from Taos Trading, a gift for a dear friend, along with a hand-made chain to go with it. I was highly pleased with both the pendant and the chain - both of them are nicely styled and heavy silver. It's a wonderful gift, even better than I'd hoped for, and the customer service was excellent. I'll keep coming back to them for items such as this one for both myself and others. <end>
 B0008GOLF6  Tiny Southwestern Desert Horned Toad Lizard Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver, #2631 ||	  Armadillo studs  This pair of sterling silver armadillos are the just the thing if you're from Texas.

They are high quality and people are always commenting about them. <end>

 B0008JF8AK  Sterling Silver 5mm Ball Earrings ||	  Arrived slightly tarnished -- but otherwise good  These appear to be well made. The backs stay on well -- don't slide off on their own. The posts don't irritate my sensitive ears at all.However, when they were first shipped, they were slightly tarnished. I wiped them with a soft cloth and they look fine now. <end>  Very Nice  Delicate without being too small. Does not irritate the skin. I wear them for weeks at a time. <end>  Really Classic Earrings!  These are great silver earrings and a perfect size, very noticeable. Another Amazon winner! I love your jewelry! <end>  5mm is pretty small  I bought these as a replacement but they're much smaller than my old silver ball studs. They're quite small. I'd probably buy twice as large next time.They don't irritate my earlobes and the posts stay on well. They do the job. <end>  Look beautiful  Just arrived today, along with the 7mm ones. Both look so beautiful. A nice shiny silver and just the right size. I bought them on sale for 60% off, so it was definitely a good deal! <end>
 B0008JF8AU  Sterling Silver 6mm Ball Earrings ||	  Not very happy with my SS ball earrings  I'm in the military, It hard for me to purchase items especially stationed overseas. It's always been easy to order from Amazon as always, I never had any problems. the earrings were beautiful but the post was very hard to remove from the earrings, when i pulled to remove the post while in my ear, the post broke off from the ball earring. I only had them for two weeks. <end>
 B0008JGUIY  Sterling-silver Rose-gold Black Hills Gold Women' & Men's Wedding-bands ||	  Gorgeous  This ring is just gorgeous, far prettier than all yellow gold would be. Purchased to wear on a finger with an arthritic knuckle, my stone ring swings to the back, it is a bigger ring to go over the knuckle. This is perfect and beautiful too. <end>  I just love it.  Sterling-silver Rose-gold Black Hills Gold 10 mm Wedding-bandsI just love this ring. You do not see black hills gold this inexpensive so I just had to have it. Also half sizes are not usually sold online. The size ordered fit perfectly and I would recommend it. <end>  Very Nice Ring  This is a nice heavy band with beautiful leaves. I wear it all time. I get a lot of compliments, I have a friend that got it for her son. I love this ring. <end>  Sterling Silver Rose Gold Black Hills Gold wedding rings  My man and I exchanged commitment rings and picked these out as our matching rings. They are very pretty, but we were surprised that the design doesn't encircle the entire ring (the underside is plain silver). For the price I would have expected the design to be on the entire ring. But they are very pretty and the meaning is what really matters to us, so we are pleased. <end>  Men's ring  I used Amazon for the first time and found it easy way to shop. I was amazed that I found a ring that my husband had lost, he was so surprised that I found another one to replace. The shipping was quick and easy <end>  Ring  I am very happy with my purchase,except for one thing. I ordered a size 51/2 ring and was sent a size 6. It is a bit too big for me. I will think twice before ordering a sized article again. <end>
 B0008JHBL4  Sterling Silver Swarovski Crystals & Jade Heart Pendant ||	  Jade  I never knew jade could come in this color but it is beautiful. I would recommend it highly. <end>  Nice Pendant  I got this jade pendant and I love it. It is lightweight and you forget you a wearing it. I get compliments everytime I wear it. <end>  Beautiful!  The pendant was even more beautiful than it was in the online photos. Beautiful stone. <end>  Home-run Heart Pendant  This is the least expensive pendant I've ever gotten my wife and yet it's one of her most cherished, definitely a "home-run" gift. The shades are beautiful & her favorite colors. Also got her the matching leverback earrings and an 18" Italian Sterling Silver 1.5MM Figaro Link Chain for it, also from Gem Avenue, all nicely packaged and one of her most favorite ensembles yet! Highly recommend. <end>  Beautiful jade  I ordered two of these pendants for Valentine's day gifts for my sons' girlfriends. The pendant is very beautiful and both noticeable and subtle at the same time. I had never seen pink jade before but it is a very pale, soft pink and looks lovely against all skin tones. I purchased, also from this site, the sterling silver Italian 1mm box chain to hang the pendant from, but it would be beautiful on a silk ribbon or cord as well. <end>
 B0008MFBO0  Very Tiny Filigree Cross Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver 1/2 inch ||	  Great quality at a nice price  I purchased 5 pairs of these earrings for stocking stuffers and they were a huge hit! I was skeptical at first after reading a few of the reviews, but decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did! Although they are small, they are well made - I've slept in mine and they haven't broken. Of all five pairs I purchased, none of them have broken or seem especially fragile. I really like these earrings - they are small and delicate yet sturdy. You can't go wrong for the price. I would definitely buy these again. <end>  nice ear studs  One of them broke after 2 days of wearing... But the other lasts. Since I only have one piercing, it's fine with me. Generally it looks good on my ear. <end>  Tiny earrings  I do mean tiny earrings. Loved them because I could keep them in at night, but easily lost one of them because they were so tiny I couldn't find it in the carpet. <end>
 B00092P3LA  Sterling Silver Snowman Frosty X-Mas Ornament Pendant ||	  SNOWMAN PENDANT  The pendant was a gift for a friend. My friend was very pleased and appreciative. Although, I like the pendant I thought from the image that it would be large. But considering the fact that it was sterling silver I was happy.Thank you,Carol Hartnett <end>
 B00093FZ2Q  14k Yellow Gold Multi-Color Dyed Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace, 18" and Earring Set ||	  Great gift for cute girlfriend.  My GF just loves this set, very good gift. reasonable price on amazon. Highly recommend <end>
 B00094OQNY  Sterling Silver 6mm Marquise Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Post Stud Earrings ||	  Sad Studs  This product was a waste of my money; a stone came out because of the bad craftmanship. I missplaced the packing for this item otherwise I would have ran it back to UPS for a quick return. Don't waste your money "Buyer Beware" <end>  Sparkly and Stunning  I ordered these earring and they were delivered to the UK quicker than a UK company would deliver them (even though it was the Christmas period)!They are 6mm across and the length is 11mm which is a little more than I wanted but when I tried them on they are actually perfect for what I need.Would recommend to anyone. <end>  Good value  These earrings are very pretty and a good value for the price. The silver is good as well, as I don't have any problem with a metal allergy. <end>  Simply Beautiful  I had been looking for a pair of earings for my third hole. When I saw these, I just had to have them. Just perfect and the price was right too! I love them! <end>
 B00095NYNQ  Antica Murrina Cuba - Murano Glass Drop Pendant Necklace amber-white ||	  Beautiful, but surprising  I think this is quite a nice piece. The amber glass center is very nice, especially in good light, and the multi-hued cords accent it well. I was surprised at two colorings, however.First, the cords aren't white, gray, silver, and black, as they looked to me to be in the shown images. Instead, they're white, tans, and browns, which of course fits better with the pendant - and looks quite nice.Second, the area around it is white - in retrospect, that's what the image above shows, but I had assumed that was the white background showing through a clear area of glass. I mention this because the white accent does change the look of the piece, and might affect when, where, or with what the piece is worn. <end>  amazing shipping  I ordered this piece as a replacement for the same pendant that my husband bought me that was broken, so I already knew that the pendant is beautiful and that I would get complements about it whenever it is worn. It looks eaqually good when dressed up or dressed down with jeans and a t-shirt.The shipping was unblevable, it was shipped in Italy on Wednesday and arrived at my door on Friday evening! It was very well packaged and the gift box was beautiful, it also arrived with a branded bag.With out a doubt I will be ordering other items from this company the quality of the item speaks for its self. <end>  Amazing.  The photos don't do much at all. You can't even call it a necklace; more like a "piece". It's art, really, and astonishingly beautiful. It glitters. I hate to take it off! <end>
 B000981H0U  Cheerful Pendant Necklace W/pink Beads [Limited Time Blowout Offer] ||	  Colorful and cute !  The arrangement of colors of the beads makes the whole necklace look so lovely.Whoever loves pink will like this one. It actually makes you look happy and younger! <end>
 B00098FKTE  Violet Pendant Necklace w/Multishaped Glass Beads ||	  Fantastic!  I was browsing through Amazon when I came upon Nvie jewelry and I absolutely love it! I bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday, but had a hard time not keeping it for myself. The necklace was really nice, well constructed, and it was shipped quickly. It looked just like the picture, but I have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one-of-a-kind.I would recommend Nvie Designs to anyone for buying really lovely, affordably priced jewelry. <end>  Lovely  I bought this necklace because it was very on sale, and I was surprised by how much I loved it when it arrived. The beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture, which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit. It's a bold necklace, but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse. <end>  Cheaply Looking & Made  I recently ordered this item, and was disappointed. The chain is of poor, cheap quality, which makes the necklace look tacky. I've bought necklaces in the same price range of much better quality. I will be returning this item, along with the other items I ordered from Nvie, also of cheap quality. <end>  Violet Pendant Necklace  This necklace came all tangled with a bead that had fallen off. Was not work shipping back to exchange. The necklace quality was not a nice as seen. I was disappointed. I do not know how this company could post it for such a high original price. <end>
 B00099CUGY  Hello Kitty by Simmons Jewelry Co. Multi-Kitty Face 8mm Ring, Size 7 ||	  Fabulous HK!  This is a simply wonderful ring! Simple yet beautiful and affordable. Low on the bling but stands out on it's own! I am not a big fan of white & thought it might look like a HK band aid, but it is very cool. It will look great with a tan in the summer!  ) My only complaint is that the size runs small for a 7. 8mm plenty big enough for small hands. If you love HK as much as I do then you need this ring! <end>
 B0009AF77W  Sterling Silver Picture Frame or Locket Photo Holder on Charm Chain Bracelet ||	  Not what I expected.  When I received this bracelet, I was happy with the look. It was pretty and the photo heart was an appropriate size. Well, when I tried to insert the picture into the heart, it was next to impossible! A heart is not an easy shape to cut a small picutre into, anyway, but this was insane!! When I finally did get the picture into it, I could not get the plastic cover back on. When I did, it ended up looking really cheap. This bracelet was good in theory, just not good in reality. Next time I will buy a necklace with an oval locket! <end>
 B0009AHCMK  Sterling Silver Irish Celtic Knot Oval Synthetic Emerald Ring size 6(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Beautiful ring, fast delivery  This was a gift, and I was very pleased with both the quality and extremely fast shipping. I will definitely purchased from this seller again. <end>  Celtic Knot Ring  This ring is beauriful, and eye catching. I unfortunatey wore it in a hot tub that had too much clorine in it so the shinyness of the metal faded, and despite that the ring remains beautiful. <end>  Very Happy  The ring arrived in great condition, and very fast as well. Item must have shipped same or next day as order was submitted. <end>  You get what you pay for  This ring looked like the ones we made in beginning jewelry in high school. It's alright, but the stone looks like one of those fake stones you glue to costumes and the lattice-like design doesn't quite meet up right.I still wear it, but it's not even close to as nice as the photograph. <end>  Good ring for money.  Got this ring last Christmas for my wife. It still looks very nice and looks more expensive than it is. She gets lots of compliments on it when she wears it. <end>  Stunning  I am very impressed with the detail work on this ring. It is really eye catching and quite lovely. The shipment arrived very quickly. The stone is a true emerald shade of green and the cut is nice, but the clarity of the stone could be a little better. However, for the price, it is an excellent ring and I would gladly give it as a gift. <end>  CELTIC IRISH KNOT SS RING  BEAUTIFUL DESIGN ON THIS STERLING SILVER RING. GOES WELL WITH THE CELTIC HEART EARRINGS AS A SET. GORGEOUS WORKMANSHIP. <end>
 B0009B87JQ  Sterling Silver Oval Pink CZ Cable Ring ||	  Excellent Product and Price  The ring is absolutely beautiful and packaged beautifully as well. I've been wearing it for several weeks now and it's just as shiny and beautiful as it was when I first got it. No tarnish at all, and the gold/silver combination is very attractive. Very quick shipping. A quality transaction all around. <end>  BEAUTIFUL  LOVE THIS RING - Worth every penny. I even kept an awful necklace from Eve's addiction just becuase I wanted to keep this ring. I didn't know how the buy one get the other 1/2 off would work if I returned the one item. I loved this ring so much, it was worth the cost of BOTH items.The color was brilliant and the weight was perfect! <end>
 B0009DX51Y  Sterling Silver Bubbles Tennis Bracelet with Heart Clasp ||	  The very pretty heart clasp tends to swing down under the wrist  I immediately loved the heart and the catch made with pave set cubic zirconias, giving a very special style to this bracelet, and the clasp is really pretty.I bought it for my daughter, she hasn't seen it yet and I hope so much that she will like it, but I must say I'm slightly disappointed. I hadn't realized that 7.25 inches is rather long, and I'm afraid it might be too long for her. I tried it on, and I have the feeling that the weight of the pretty heart clasp will tend to make it swing downwards, therefore the very "special" note to this bracelet (the heart clasp) will not be very noticeable. I hope it won't tend to do so, for it might also actually get used or scratched by everyday use (like typing on her computer for example)and that would be a pity. If this bracelet had a tight fit, this wouldn't happen, and it could be even more unique.The rhodium finish over sterling silver however appears to be of good quality, and all in all it is a pretty bracelet, so I kept it, hoping that she will like it as much as I did when I saw it. If the clasp does swing downwards -as I'm pretty sure it will- I will see what we can do to have it fitted in a tighter way, and I'm crossing fingers that it won't be too expensive to have it fitted to her wrist. <end>
 B0009E02KA  10mm Sterling Silver Bead Earrings ||	  Too big for small ears  These studs were too big for me. I wear the 6mm studs from Eve's Addiction almost everyday and love them. The silver has not worn off and I have had them for almost six months now. I would buy them again. <end>  Perfect for everyday  I bought these earrings a couple of months ago and I love them! They came in a beautiful velvet pouch and gift box. They are simple enough to wear every day and go with just about anything. I plan on ordering another pair to keep as a spare in case I lose one. <end>  BAD!  do not buy this item...i ordered these originally to save money instead of spending it on the real tiffany and co silver bead earrings..i wore these for a week and took good care of them and the silver rubbed off/made my ears bleed/the backs were very hard to work....dont waste a cent on these!!! <end>
 B0009E5QJC  Sterling Silver Diamond Cubic Zirconia 1.25 Inch O Necklace ||	  I'm pleased with the necklace  I bought this necklace not really knowing what I was getting. It ended up being the perfect size and length and so much cheaper than similar necklaces I've seen in the department stores. If you don't mind that the cubic zirconia 'diamonds' are tiny and that it makes the circle look like cut-work rather than 'real diamonds' I think you'll be pleased with this piece of trendy jewelry.I also must give kuddos to the company for it's quick service and delivery, I received it within 3 days of the order.I hope that future orders from this company yield the same affect. <end>
 B0009ELS26  Amber, Turquoise and Recycled Glass Bracelet ||	  Beautiful Bracelet  Bought this item as a Mother's Day gift - mom loved it; it's a beatiful piece of jewlery. It even arrived early (and I shopped last minute). Will buy again from this supplier. <end>
 B0009EPBTM  Pugster Size 8 Emerald Cz Sterling Silver Jewelry Ring Fashion ||	  Like the real thing  This ring is beautiful. It is as striking as the real thing. I do think my size 7 is a touch on the big side but not enough for me to send it back for a smaller size. <end>
 B0009EYJLS  Men's Titanium Open Link Bracelet w/ Steel Clasp, 8" ||	  Love it!!  I am very happy with this bracelet. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my 35 year old son and I know he is going to love it . . both the style, as well as the fact that it is titanium and requires no care. The large links are brushed, but the small connecting links are a polished finish. I thought any kind of titanium men's jewelry would be totally out of my price reach, but you can't beat this price or the quality! <end>  Son-in-law loves this bracelet.  I ordered this for my son-in-law from his Amazon "Wish List," and when it arrived, he put it on and continues to wear it everywhere. He loves it. <end>  Very Pleased  I was very pleased with my purchase and it arrived on time. I will be purchasing again. <end>
 B0009FBDMK  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 18 Inch 7-8mm White Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Simply GORGEOUS  I ordered this strand of pearls as a gift and WOW!...I was so impressed (wish it was a gift for myself). Authentic looking, great luster and color. It is simply GORGEOUS, very worth the money, sure to please. Don't hesitate on this one, Very highly recommended A+ <end>  Not very impressed  I purchased this item as a gift for my wife, and was quite disappointed.Despite the item's description, the pearls were all irregular and not well matched. They were also dull in appearance and had very visible flaws.Admittedly, at this price point, you're not going to have a perfect strand of pearls. However, a side-by-side comparison with the14k Yellow Gold Akoya Cultured Pearl 6.5-7mm Necklace and Stud Earring Setshowed that the Akoya set had pearls that were all round or near-round, very well matched, and were not noticeably smaller than this necklace. Not to mention the price was about the same, and you get matching earrings. <end>
 B0009FCDX8  1/2 Carat Channel Set Diamond & Ruby Earrings in White Gold (with Safety Lock) ||	  Great customer service  Because of a change in mind, I had to return my item. But the customer service I received in doing so was outstanding.I would definitely buy again from this vendor. <end>
 B0009FINBY  Diamond cut Sterling Silver 3/4" Hoop Earrings Huggies ||	  Nice for the price  But they cost $8, and they look like they cost $8. The pattern along the earrings is very pretty, and for the price they are as nice as you are going to find. But I think around $50 is required to find a truly nice set of hoop earrings. <end>
 B0009FJ9Y4  Cultured 18 Inches 1-Strand 6.5-7mm White Pearl Necklace & 6.5-7mm White Pearl Earrings with Silver Mount ||	  Unsure at first but glad I did  I have never bought jewelry online before and was a little unsure about doing it. I mean the price difference between here and my local jewelry stores was a big difference. I thought well the price was so low that if it wasn't any good, I wasn't out that much. I'm glad I made the decision to buy from this online retailer. They were great. Same quality as my local jewelry store but with online shopping prices. They were a big hit. The only drawback was the cheesy looking appraisal sheet they came with. I say cheesy because it was just a photocopy of the appraisal document and then folded like an accordion into the same box. The description did say it would come with a copy of the appraisal sheet, I just didn't think it would have been folded so many time. I would have been a little more impressed if it were copied and not folded so many times or emailed to me for me to print out. Not that it mattered that much anyway, the jewelry is what it was about anyways. Thanks again. Would buy from again. <end>  Love, love, love  I bought these for my wife she loved them and said they are her favorite piece by far. She wears them often and they show no sign of wear. They were a Christmas gift and are very nice. I was very satisfied with the quality. <end>
 B0009FTH5U  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 18 Inch 5-5.5mm White Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Excellent pearl quality! Benevolent price!  Okay, you may be deterred by the price, thinking it's far too low to have good quality pearls. Well, no offense, but you're wrong.These pearls are surprisingly good quality, and they even come with a GIA certificate! The weight and feel are good. They seem to have been very well matched for size and roundness. Luster is high to medium-high.Well, the results speak for themselves. She loved them and still does. <end>  Wonderful Set of Pearls  These pearls are just beautiful. The size is just small enough that I can fit my larger enhancers over the pearls. They are nicely round and uniform, with very high luster. This is a great value. <end>  Beautiful...  My wife loved these pearls, though there were no ear-rings as stated by the previous reviewer... all in all a good buy... <end>  Very nice  This necklace is absolutely beautiful! The pearls are a beautiful color with great luster and just the right size. Unfortunately the clasp was broken - I did contact Augustina Jewelry to inform them of this problem and they were quick in replying and were ready to fix the clasp for me. However by that time I realized I would prefer a 20 inch version which they do not have - if they did I would buy it in a heartbeat! I ended up returning this product, but would recommend it to anyone looking for a necklace like this. <end>  Absolutely Perfect!  These pearls are absolutely gorgeous! They even included a set of earrings -- which I did not expect! I LOVE the smaller size -- so perfectly dainty. My husband will be so surprised at what he got ME for Christmas. <end>  These Pearls are beautiful  I bought these pearls for my wife but, I bought them to make a pair of panties special. [...] has a pair of panties that has a string of pearls on it well those ones are fake so i bought a strand of pearls to make them real my wife loves the pearls and panties, oh wait so do i. <end>
 B0009G11LW  Garnet anklet, 'Dancing Queen' 1" W 10" L ||	  rebecca siouxse  what a wonderful ankle bracelet. the quality is amazing, the shipping and packaging in a brocade box is classy, and as always novica artistry is beautiful. <end>
 B0009G2YU4  Lapis lazuli bracelet, 'Connected' ||	  Lapis Bracelet  I was very pleasantly surprized by this bracelet. It is beautiful and looks much more expensive than it costs. I am very pleased. <end>
 B0009G318S  Amethyst, garnet and topaz brooch-pendant, 'Bouquet' 2" W 2" L ||	  Simply Elegant  I was captured by the simplistic beauty of this brooch. As an old-fashioned admirer of brooches, I must have this in my collection. Congratulations to the designer! <end>
 B0009G4SCQ  Amethyst necklace, 'Perfect Plum' ||	  Cool Gift  This necklace was given to me as a gift for Christmas and is really cool. I like the fact that it was made by someone who took care and time to make it look beautiful. I also like the fact that it came with a hand written thank you on a postcard from the person who made. <end>
 B0009G7B70  Mens Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Band Ring(Sizes 14,15) ||	  Hi  I fricking love my new Claddagh ring! I've always wanted one and now I'm happy I have one so thanks! ^_^ <end>
 B0009GGZRW  Sterling Silver Loop Chain Pendant, 18" ||	  Hip and Fun!  This necklace is very well represented by the photo. I was worried that the loop chains would be flimsy or get easily kinked, and that does not seem to be the case. The piece will go well with a variety of styles, great for a nice evening out or a fun night on the town. I have several pieces from the Amazon collection, and this is one of my favorites. I hope it stands up well to frequent wear, as I see this becoming a staple in my jewelry collection! <end>  one of my favorites  I bought both the necklace and the earrings a few years ago and still love them! The pendant is the perfect size as it does not overpower the neckline. <end>  Excellant Value  Great value. Understated, yet elegant. A better picture would have helped a lot in the decision making process. <end>  Unusual and eyecatching  People always compliment this pendant when I wear it and think it's from a boutique or more "exclusive" shop. I have the matching earrings and have been very pleased with the set. Though I read the dimensions, I didn't quite calculate them into a real-life size, and initially the pendant was smaller than I expected, but after putting it on, it's just right. <end>
 B0009GH026  Sterling Silver Eternity Cross Pendant, 20" ||	  "Sterling Silver Eternity Cross Pendant, 20""  Nice piece of sterling silver jewelry. Great as a communion, graduation or even Christmas gift. Looks very nice and the 20" chain is the perfect length. I like that it's simple but still stylish and pretty. <end>  Misleading  The cross looks petite and pretty, but it is HUGE! So big it looks tacky. I sent mine back. Amazon should have given measurements of the cross! <end>  Very happy  This cross was exactly as presented, quickly shipped and is beautiful. It was a gift for my granddaughter and she was ecstatic about it. Will continue to buy from Amazon.com. <end>  My wife loved this  For the price this was quite a buy. I bought this as a valentine present and she just loved it and wears it all the time. The picture does not do it justice. <end>

I received this pendant quickly, and in gift appropriate packaging. I am very pleased with the necklace and with the prompt service from the seller. <end>  Nice Pendant  A very nice pendant, light with shining,excellent.The lace is too slim, but anyway, I bought the pendant  -)if the lace could be more strong, then this item will be perfect. <end>

 B0009GH0J4  Sterling Silver Aqua Cat's Eye Earrings ||	  Make blue eyes pop!  These were given as a gift to someone with blue eyes, and they make her eyes look bluer. The cat's eye stone reflect light beautifully. They are lightweight and easy to wear. <end>
 B0009GH0JO  Sterling Silver Green Cat's Eye Earrings ||	  beautiful and well made  I really was impressed after getting these earrings. The stone is a beautiful shade of jade green and the surface is smooth and shiny. The hooks are quite small but stay in place. The main oval section is a little over 1/2 inch. Overall, very sophisticated and delecate looking. <end>
 B0009GH0N0  Sterling Silver Double Circle Pink Cat's Eye Earrings ||	  pretty, delicate  I just received these today. I also bought a matching pink cat's eye pendant. They look just like the pictures. The outer circle is about 1.4 cm in diameter. They look tasteful and pretty. <end>
 B0009GH0XK  Sterling Silver and Amethyst Round Drop Pendant, 16" ||	  Very Pretty Pendant  I purchased this as a gift for Mom, since it's her birthstone. It's very pretty, and she wears it frequently. The stone is of a good quality. The setting is well made. The chain is delicate but a bit short at 16" (my personal preference is 18"). <end>
 B0009GH0XU  Sterling Silver and Amethyst Rectangular Drop Earrings ||	  great gift  for a young teen or bridal gift, this is an inexpensive way for jewelry. it's a modern style that appeals to all fashion styles. this is a nice piece of jewelry. <end>  Beautiful  I received a gift card to Amazon several years back and bought these. They are more beautiful in person - maybe a little on the small side, but not heavy and teh Amethyst is a true purple! <end>
 B0009H5UZ4  Sterling Silver Daisy Ring ||	  very cute  this ring is a very cute ring. the only problem i have with it is, the petals catch on to some of my clothing. Still very cute and good value. <end>
 B0009HB9OU  Swarovski Crystalline Monte Carlo Chandelier Belly Chain ||	  pretty, but lime stones fall out easily  This belly chain is really pretty. But when I received the item there were some lime stones fall-outs. Tried to glue them back but it's not easy to do and it made the lime stones look dimmer. Be careful when handling the chain because the lime stones do come off <end>
 B0009HFQ08  Sterling Silver Lavender Crystal Threader Ear Wire Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Beautiful!  These are classy and beautiful. They are slightly heavy and they tend to slip down but included are two soft invisible backings so that they won't be lost. Service is perfect. I highly recommend these and other products from this seller, I have never been disappointed. <end>  Great Buy!!  These earrings are a great buy for the money. I bought them as bridesmaids gifts for my wedding and couldn't be more pleased! <end>  not exactly what i was looking for  I was thinking that they were chain not wire. i dont like the wire ones. so that was a mistake on my part. the earrings themselves were pretty, but i will say i thought they would look more dainty. the crystal was a little larger then i hoped. <end>  Great  I love both pair of earrings, if I had to change something I would make the end of the threader a little longer for people with larger fingers. Other than that they are wonderful. <end>
 B0009HIJ7U  Swarovski Light Blue Charm Belly Chain ||	  Great  I love it. I wear it almost everyday. I love shopping with body candy, they always have great things at great prices. <end>
 B0009HJ3V6  Three Stone Antique Look Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  Great If You Don't Plan To Wear It Often  It's beautiful and I get many people tell me how pretty it is, but after you wear it a couple of weeks, it leaves a black mark around your finger that doesn't wash completely off for several days. <end>
 B0009I6I2M  JJ Weston gold plated and onyx with etched scales of justice legal symbol cufflinks with presentation box. Made in the U.S.A ||	  Great gift for a judge or lawyer!

He loved them and they did look stunning and very nicely packaged. <end>
 B0009J8RDE  CZ Reversible Huggy Earrings - Clearance Final Sale ||	  they are beautifulllll!!!!  They are what I was looking for!!! something to wear every day or out on a date just love them!!! <end>
 B0009JASWM  Sterling Silver Necklace with Bezel Set CZ ||	  I'm not a fan of this necklace  The CZ is MUCH bigger than it looks in the picture. The effectis not so much the classy but still affordable that I was shootingfor, but more "Look what I could have bought at Claire's for $6,but instead wasted $25 on." I wasn't thrilled, to say the least.It's not the most horrible thing ever, but it's certainly notgreat either. It's just kind of tacky and cheap looking. Whichwas extremely disappointing. I think it's probably best for reallyyoung girls who really just want something that's kinda shiny, andwhose parents don't want to worry about letting them play with somethingthat has actual value. <end>  Sterling Silver Necklace with Bezel Set CZ - Amazon Verified Purchase  I ordered this item for my daughter for Christmas in a 18" length. It looks exactly like a diamond necklace that had been advertised on TV which my daughter loved. I paid to get it delivered by Christmas and the product arrived in time. However, the company sent a 16" length instead of an 18" length which was terribly disappointing to my daughter. They did exchange the chain for the correct length, but since this was a Christmas gift for which I paid rush shipping to get it on time, I would have thought I would be offered a discount off the product, particularly since this is not really cheap for what it is. It is beautiful, however, and you would not be disappointed in buying one, providing the company sends you the right length, especially if it's a gift. <end>  Great for Brides on a Budget  I got six of these necklaces for my bridesmaids and flower girl. We were on a pretty tight budget for our wedding so I was happy to find something that was simple, elegant and most importantly affordable. The package came quickly and each necklace was in its own jewelry box, so it made giving them to my girls very easy. Thanks for helping to make my wedding beautiful!! <end>  Bridesmaids gifts  I bought 6 of these necklaces for my bridesmaids and they were perfect! The simple bezel design was the perfect fit for the dresses, simple and elegant. The girls loved the necklaces and they were an inexpensive gift as well as something that they could wear again with just about any outfit. I also bought the matching earrings. <end>
 B0009JF2VY  Sterling Silver Daisy Pendant ||	  Beautiful  I bought this item for my niece, she loved it. Excellent quality and beautifully presented. <end>  Very nice daisy pendant  I was very happy with my purchase of this daisy pendant. It's just what I wanting for myself to wear in memory of my beloved yellow lab, Daisy. I receive many nice comments on it. <end>  Daisy Necklace  We really like this quality of this necklace and how great it looks in person. The chain is the perfect length also. Very pleased with this purchase. <end>
 B0009JFJOE  Vintage Style Sterling Silver Filigree .85ct Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  Pretty, but ...  This is a pretty little ring, the CZ is bright and sparkles nicely. However, the band is so soft I can bend it between my fingers without even trying. Everytime I wear it, it comes off a different shape than when it went on, just from my body heat. I don't know if they didn't have my size when I ordered it and so stretched this one out too thin to fit me, or if has some soft lead mixed in with the sterling silver. The band is also a lot cheaper looking than that depicted in their picture. It is pretty but disappointing all at the same time. I would have to agree with a previous reviewer, don't get this one if you want to pretend it is something richer. <end>  Absolutely exquisite!  I wish I could give this ring more than just 5 stars- it is that gorgeous. The CZ really looks like the real deal, and the hand cast silver is lovely. My friends are going to covet this ring for sure! I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this seller. <end>  a rare find  I never bother to write reviews but I was so delighted with my ring I wanted to share my two cents. After reading the other comments I was a little concerned, but I did not have any problems with sizing or anything else. The ring is nicer than I was expecting, it's a little more delicate and not quite as tribal looking as it appears in the picture. The stone is substantial(without being too big) and well cut so it looks legit. Definitely worth the price. <end>  It's a OK ring  I waited a long time for this little ring, and when it finally came I wanted to jump through the roof over it, but I just could not get up the steam to do so! This ring was not a complete disappointment but it was far from something I would proudly wear around if I was trying to pass it off as the real deal. For one, the sizing was off. I know I ordered my correct size but it was still a little too big. Secoundly, the dimound size was believeable, yet it looked a bit cloudy to me. The craftmanship was beautiful, but for some reason though it said .925 stearling silver it was a rusty color. Maybe that was part of the antique look, but I thought it was strange. Not a bad ring overall, but if you are looking for something to really pass off it's best to just buy it at a store so you can really see how it looks. <end>
 B0009JKJ5I  Cute Stretchy Tiger Eye Bracelet ||	  Beautiful, polished stones  The most beautiful, shiny, polished tiger eye stones I have ever seen! I have been looking for this type of bracelet and finally found it. <end>  totally satisfied  the original bracelet came to my house very quickly. had a few chips in the stones. before I could even contact the seller about my disappointment, they had read my seller feedback, emailed me, and shipped me a new one all before I was even through my morning coffee the next day. the bracelet itself was very pretty, and fit very well. can't wait to get my replacement so I can start wearing it. I give this company a 12 out of 10 especially for customer service. and for the record, I do own other bracelets I bought from them that I totally love! I have bought from them before and definitely will again! <end>  Great Bracelet  The stones are beautiful on this bracelet. It goes beautifully with my beaded tops. More than worth the money! <end>  BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL  This bracelet is gorgeous in person. Nice weight and shiny stones. You can dress this bracelet up. It is more than what I accepted. The price is unbelievable for this quality. Will be purchasing more. Great buy!! <end>
 B0009JLVWS  Peridot N' Pink Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Not as good as picture...  The peridot in the center is yellow color rather than green.. it really looks more like five dollar costume jewelery than something worth spending $34 on. Total rip off, don't buy it. <end>  colors look faded  Center stone looks yellow, pink stones look faded, colors are not as shown in picture. stones do have a nice shine to them even though the colors look faded <end>
 B0009JLWAE  Cute Stretchy Mixed Gemstone Bracelet ||	  PRECIOUS- PRECIOUS- BRACELET  I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THEIR BRACELETS,BUT THIS ONE HAS A SPECIAL QUALITY TO IT,IT LOOKS SO EXPENSIVE,AND IS SO PRETTY,MATCHES EVERYTHING,WHAT CAN I SAY,I GUESSS THE LORD WAS GOOD TO ME,FINDING THIS AT A PRICE I CAN AFFORD,THE FIRST TIME I WORE IT,I GOT A COMPLIMENT,EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE I GOT IT,I LOVE THIS BRACELET. <end>  Cute jewelry  I love all of the bracelets that I've purchased from this vendor. They are cute and inexpensive... also, I've recieved so many compliments on this bracelet. I'm very pleased with this jewelry vendor! <end>  How beautiful!!!!  I really Love this bracelet, I Can't wait to wear it out. I just ordered three more for friends. Thanks Cool! <end>
 B0009JRH9Y  Antique Style 3 Stone Ruby Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  Late and Fake  Very Late, Ordered as a anniversary present for my wife 9 days prior to our anniversary and it didn't arrive until 3 weeks after our anniversary. Ring doesn't have much shine and looks fake. The ruby is much larger than it appears in the picture, the two CZs on the sides of it are cloudy and do not shine, and the smaller CZs all around have no glisten and make the metal look like plastic. <end>
 B0009K6QUO  Western Embossed Brown Leather Cuff Bracelet ||	  Great Bracelet  I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she absolutely loves it! The quality and detail on the bracelet are excellent.. <end>
 B0009KNBWK  Akoya Cultured Pearl 7-7.5mm Stud Earrings ||	  cultured pearl  Bought for a gift for the wife, she loves them. Received on time and product was as advertised. <end>
 B0009KNBXE  Akoya Cultured Pearl 5mm Earrings w/ Diamond (.04ctw) ||	  These are gorgeous for only $80!  This is a fabulous pair of earrings at a great price. They are a gift for my sister for being in my wedding (my birthstone & hers) and I cannot wait to give them to her! <end>
 B0009KNBYS  Akoya Cultured Pearl 6mm Pendant w/ Diamond (.03 ct) on 14k White Gold Chain, 18" ||	  BEAUTIFUL  This beautiful pearl was flawless and shiny to me. The diamond was bigger than I thought it would be a was noticeable because of its nice sparkle. The chain is dainty. The overall presentation is very feminine! We bought them for service awards at my work, and after seeing the great gift (and great gift box too) I'll be keeping this item in mind for myself! More than worth the cost ($90 at the time I purchased) <end>
 B0009KNC06  Sterling Silver Pink Freshwater Pearl Chain Earrings ||	  Nice product  I liked the look of this piece of jewelry online and bought it. My wife loves more because it came from me, I think, not because it is so great. It is reasonably beautiful, though the pink is not as bright a pink as I seem to have seen it online, and the pearls are not as evenly spherical as the online photos suggest. From a distance of a few feet it looks great. I understand that these imperfections exist. I would have given five stars if the online photo matched the piece I got. My wife and I are perfectly happy with what we got. <end>  Pretty earrings shame about the postage  The earrings were lovely, very well made. But the postage (to France) from Amazon was, to my mind, exhorbitant. I bought earrings from another company and was charged one quarter of the postage that Amazon charged. That said it was extremely well packaged <end>  don't buy these  This product was very disapointing - I had to return them - <end>
 B0009KNC2E  Freshwater Cultured Pink Pearl Necklace, 17" ||	  Pink Pearl Necklace  This product is picture perfect. There are no flaws in the pearls, and they are not dull. <end>
 B0009KNC7E  Sterling Silver Children's Double Heart Pendant, 14" ||	  Cute necklace!  I bought this for my 7 yr old daughter and it fit her just right.It is nice quality and the 2 interlocking hearts pendant is a great way to symbolize love.I am very happy with this necklace.It was just what I was looking for to give my daughter her first "real" necklace (which made her feel big) and help to teach her responsibility to take care of and keep up with her jewelry. <end>  Childrens Necklace  IT IS THE PERFECT GIFT FOR A LITTLE GIRLS FIRST NECKLACE ITS LIGHT SO WHEN THEY RUN IT DOESNT HIT THEM IN THE FACE CAUSING THEM NOT TO WANT TO WEAR IT. ITS ALSO THE RIGHT LENGTH AND SIZE FOR A CHILD OVERALL ITS WONDERFUL AND MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT VERY MUCH, SHE SAYS SHE HAS BIG GIRL JEWELRY. <end>  Chain Disappoints  This is an appropriate size for a very young girl (my granddaughter is 4). But the chain is a little too thin and knots in very tight knots very easily. I'm usually good at getting these undone, but it took me 15 minutes of patient work with a toothpick and some salad oil on the knot to finally loosen it enough to undo it. <end>  Great for children  I gave this necklace to my daughter who was becoming a new big sister and she just loved it. The necklace was very symbolic because the big heart represented Big Sister and the little heart represented little sister holding on. I just loved it. <end>  All about the chain  Sterling Silver Children's Double Heart Pendant, 14"The heart itself is adorable. The minute you unhook the chain it starts to tangle. I purchased three for christmas presents and all three tangled once unhooked. I had to run out and quickly buy three presents. In my opinion...this is badly made and if I could give this a zero rating I would. When this arrived and I opened the first box, I thought it odd that the chain was set behind the bottom pad...holding a little velvet pouch with the heart inside...now I know it was to prevent tangling. <end>
 B0009MD57E  14K Gold 4 mm CZ Stud Earrings Brilliant Cut Basket Set 1/2 Carat Size ||	  They look really chaep.  Personally didn't like how the stalk wasn't centered in the earring with the stud, instead it's placed below the stud. Makes the earrings LOOK CHEAP. They look a lot better in the pictures. <end>  Very Nice  I am very pleased with these earrings. I like the basket setting very much, and the czs are clean and pretty and have nice sparkle. I like the .25 ct weight per earring; not too big, not too small, just right! These earrings are as nice, if not nicer, than a 1/4 ct pair of diamond earrings I once purchased and returned - and paid much more money for. <end>  Nice stones  Stones, 14k, very shiny and realistic. I just wish I had gotten a bit larger size , did not want them too large or people would know they were fake! I just put my hair behind my ears when I wear them so they can be seen! <end>  THE ONLY PROBLEM...  ...I had with these earrings are that I misplaced them! I don't wear a lot of yellow gold jewelry because it's not my taste but you could barely see this gold which is something I'm always concerned about but you could barely see it at all. <end>  Satisfied customer  I recently purchased these 1/4 carat CZ post earrings. I didn't know what to expect and was extremely happy with what I received. They were the perfect size for me and look great on. The only problem I had was with the backs of the earrings not being tight and coming off easy. I just put different backs on them and now am perfectly happy with them. <end>
 B0009MGNW8  14K Gold 3 mm CZ Stud Earrings Brilliant Cut Basket Set 1/5 Carat Size ||	  Pretty Little Earrings!  These little earrings are so pretty! The cubic zirconias are very good quality. The same day these earrings arrived, I went to a dept. store to look at their real diamond studs, since I was looking for a pair of real diamonds, too. Sad to say the real diamonds looked fake compared to these. LOL Of course you can buy a pair of good quality diamond studs just as pretty, but it will cost a lot more money. I was very happy with my purchase. <end>
 B0009MI4U2  14K Gold 5 mm Square CZ Stud Earrings Basket Set 1 1/2 Carat Size ||	  Kind of small but ok  For the price it is and ok product. The gold is very thin, so you got to be carefull while handle it. Looks ok for a day to day basis. <end>  Disappointing  The stones and setting were nice, but the post was so short and clamp was so small that I couldn't wear them - had to give them away to a "tiny" person. <end>
 B0009MZA1S  20" Sterling Silver 1mm Round Omega Chain Necklace ||	  20" SS 1mm omega perfect chain  I am a glass artist and was looking for an affordable way to show my dicroic pendants. This omega fit the bill perfectly.Will purchase more. <end>  Poor quality  It is stiff and kinks very easily, and once it kinks, you cannot get the kink out, so pendents hang lopsided on it. Don't buy this. <end>  Not a happy camper  Although the service regarding shipping with this item was great, in the long-run I was not at all happy with this chain. I wore it a time or 2 within a few months of receiving it and it wore fine.. Then, when it was stored (flat, to hold the shape) it started 'curling' in on itself and no matter what I did I could not get it to regain the shape it was supposed to have. It became completely unusable after a few months. <end>  chain review  well i think the product is not what it looks like in the pic, its the first product from amazon im disappointed in, its too fragile and breaks very easily upon the first couple of uses even <end>  Perfect!  I bought this omega to go with a pendant that I bought for my Bridesmaids. It is exactly what I wanted! <end>  Sadly not durable  This product looks very nice, but I won't buy the omega chains anymore. As time wears on, the underlying wire gets more and more kinked, and on mine it eventually broke (about 1.5 years on), leaving the fronting on the chain unwinding. if you're looking for short term it works nicely, but especially with the heavy pendant I put on this one it was impractical for long term use. It may be more durable with a lighter pendant, but I think it would still be susceptible to kinking every time you put it away. <end>  silver chain  I purchased this to hold a wiccan protection knot pendant. My daughter loves silver and this is very strong as well as pretty. <end>  Necklaces  I purchased this silver necklace to go with an amethyst gem in a setting and not only do they look GREAT together, but the recipient LOVED them! <end>
 B0009N7KII  Orange & Brown Swarovski Crystal & Enamel Brooch ||	  Very Pretty  I gave this to my mom, and she really liked it. I thought it was even prettier in person than online. <end>
 B0009OHEDS  Sterling Silver Shiny Heart Shaped Toe Ring ||	  Sterling Siver, Toe Ring  I've never hearn nor wore a toe ring in my life..while browsing through Gem Avenue's jewerly, I cam across a Sterling Silver, Heart-Shaped, toe ring.Debating whether or not to purchase, thinking it'd be uncomfortable, or afraid it'd fall and get lost, I contempated buying jewelry that goes on my toe.To my surprise, the toe-ring fit was a perfect fit. So much so, while wearing it, I forgot there was a foreign object on my toe..lol.Gem Avenue has excellent jewelry at great prices. Each item is well-made, and stones look genuine.Each piece of jewerly comes in a cute little box, in various colors and shapes. Shipping is prompt to boot. Gem Avenue has my business. Toni <end>  totally fine  if u like sterling this 1 is fine, exactly as described. what you see is what you get. <end>
 B0009PF0S8  Titanium Black Jeweled Navel Bar with a Vitrail Light Swarovski stone 14 guage by 1/2" ||	  Slow to ship good product.  They said they would ship item in 2 days took 6 and it arrived 3-4 days after that. If I didn't like the product so much this would be a 1 star. <end>
 B0009PIVCU  White Synthetic Cats Eye Beaded Wide Stretch Bracelet ||	  BEAUTIFUL BRACELET  ONCE AGAIN SILVER INSANITY GAVE ME A BEAUTIFUL BRACELET AT A GREAT PRICE.IF YOOU LOVE CAT'S EYES, YOU WILL LOVE THIS.LOVE IT. <end>
 B0009PJIZE  Unique Retro Funky and Chunky Pastel Beaded 3-Strand Vintage Style Bracelet ||	  Definitely a conversation-starter!  This pretty bracelet has so much interest to it, that it cannot but fail to get a lot of notice when you wear it! The colors are very pastel, and would be great with navy blues or dark pinks. Just a couple of caveats  it is LARGER than I thought it might be, so if you like tiny, delicate bracelets, this is not for you! However, given the size of it (stones & baubles run about 1/2" to 3/4" long and 1/4" wide), it is sure to catch attention. Also stones are not real, not even quartzes, but mostly plastic and jewelers metal - doesn't diminish from the beauty but it must be said, in case you are looking for real semi-precious stones. It is adjustable, so will fit both larger and smaller wrists - I am a 7 1/2", and on the loosest setting, it slides easily over my hand and hangs nice and loose. You can tighten it up, obviously. Packaged beautifully in a black velveteen bag, and would make a lovely gift for the price. <end>  Great service - great item !!  Excellent service - received item very quickly. Great item also - received many compliments on bracelet. Would buy again from this company !! <end>
 B0009PJM82  Sterling Silver Purple and Pink Flowers Ring ||	  Very feminine  Very sparkly, very feminine. I was skeptical about the quality, having ordered from TV channels with pretty awful quality. However, I really like this ring. The green is lighter on my ring than what is shown, but other than that, it looks almost exactly how it looks here. <end>  Magnificently sublte  I, too, was leary of "cheap" jewerly. However, with Amazon's return policy I put this on my wish list. My honey bought it for me and when I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised. The ring is sterling silver and the colors of the stones, perhaps a shade lighter than in the picture, blend together to form a muted palette. I've gotten nothing but compliments and rave reviews about this ring. It shines and sparkles! <end>  Good Value  My wife likes it. It's not as colorful in person as it is in the picture online. <end>  Beautiful but Poor Qualty  I was really excited to get this ring for Christmas since I had it on my wish list for months. It's so pretty but one of the stones fell out within an hour of putting it on for the first time. My parents are returning it and will probably get me another one...hopefully that one holds together. <end>  Spring Like Floral Ring  Beautiful quality and light weight to wear. Lovely setting and shiny sterling silver. I wear this ring in the spring and summer. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys colorful floral jewelry. Super quality! <end>  unsatisfactory  This ring is cheap! I loved it until i looked at it real close n saw that the parts holding the stones on didn't seem really in tact. I picked it ONCE, a tiny bit with my fingernail and the stone popped right off! i have to send it back..  ( <end>
 B0009PLR9Y  Pink and Diamond Cubic Zirconia Ring in Sterling Silver ||	  Pale beauty  The ring design is really quite lovely, but the pink stones are alot lighter than the picture shows them to be. The pink color is more pale(like a morganite stone)not a vibrant pink sapphire color. I'll keep it and wear it, but I would not have purchased if the stone color was pictured correctly. <end>  Lots of compliments!  Ring was an accurate fit. Fast customer service - was sent quickly. Received lots of compliments! Always love putting this ring on in the morning! <end>
 B0009QZUZ0  Cute Stretchy Fluorite Bracelet ||	  Great bracelet at a great price!  I love this bracelet and wear it with everything! <end>
 B0009QZV0E  Cute Stretchy Hematite Bracelet ||	  Bright & Shiny!  A beautiful shiny stone that appears to be a metal. A beautiful design. <end>  Great bracelet, a bit big though  I really like this bracelet. It's very shiny and quite substantial. I wear a 7 inch bracelet, and this one is a bit big on me. <end>  Very Versitle!  I bought this bracelet awhile back. It still looks as good as new! I love the weight and metallic look of it. It really goes with almost everything. Highly recommend!I am adding to this after wearing for almost one year- Still holding its shape and not stretched out at all! Love these bracelets!!! <end>
 B0009R1U12  Sterling Silver 6mm Round CZ Engagement and Wedding Band Ring Set(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  simply beautiful  this ring is simply beautiful, it actully looks alot nicer in person than it does in the picture, i highly recomed it to anyone! <end>  Sterling Silver can be a Best Friend, Too!  I love my Sterling Silver 6mm Round CZ Engagement and Wedding Band Ring Set. I kept the price a secret from my Husband of 5 years. He did not want to shop so he left it up to me. Being a reasonably sound person and having a mortgage to pay, I ordered this ring set and saved us thousands of $$$. In all these years my rings have not tarnished or lost its luster. They are as beautiful as the day I received them. And although they are being replaced in the near future-I will always be pleased and thankful for a luxurious start. <end>
 B0009R5NJ2  Dagger through the Heart - Skull and Sword Pirate Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Elegant  Obviously, dagger through heart earrings are a statement. If you're going to make it, you may as well do it with class. These earrings are beautiful, and beautifully crafted, and get constant compliments. Flattering and elegant! <end>  precious hearts  My mother loves silver and she loves hearts so I thought she'd like these earrings. She LOVES them! I got them for her for Mother's Day and they arrived the day before. They are beautiful and such a great value. <end>

 B0009RFXBA  Sterling Silver Gothic Bat Garnet Armor Ring Size 10(Sizes 5,6,7,8,10) ||	  gothic bat ring  i got this ring today, and it do not look like the picture. the ring looks cheap. the design you see in this picture is not what i got. do not buy this ring you will be very upset when you get it out of your mail box. <end>
 B0009RK3JW  Sterling Silver Shimmering Diamond CZ Ring Set Size 8 (Sizes 5 8 9 Available) ||	  Looks fake...  This ring looked pretty on line, but it looked fake in "person". I tried it on, and it felt too "chunky" on my hand. I was disappointed, and sent it back. I still like products from this vendor, but this one didn't make the cut! <end>  Shimming Diamond CZ Ring Set  Very nice ring set. I definitely got my moneys worth and will be ordering again from evesaddiction. I received my package quickly and the customer service was great. <end>
 B0009RNZ74  4 Leaf Clover - Belly Ring - Luck of the Irish - Quality Materials - Customize Your Fit ||	  Fantastic! Saved my piercing!  After having a baby and losing around 45 pounds, my navel piercing doesn't look like it used to. Every ring I've gotten doesn't fit right like its too loose, or if it was a top dangle would get caught on stuff and irritate it. I was considering just taking it out and letting it close up. Not this one! The dangle doesn't feel heavy so it doesn't pull down, but it is good quality and not flimsy. The bar fit my piercing perfectly so it doesn't look like its just hanging there. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who is having problems with the bar being too long and wants something different from just a plain standard barbell! Fast shipping and very well packaged. Couldn't have been better. <end>  Love this!  After the birth of my child, my belly button piercing was left EXTREMELY shallow. I thought that I was never going to be able to wear a belly button ring again. All of the ones I tried on were so long that they looked ridiculous. The 5/16" bar fits perfectly, and the jewelry design makes it look like it isn't even a shallow piercing. Best ring hands down for shallow piercings, it looks great! <end>  Clover jewelry  It came quickly, with more than adequate packaging and it was a big hit with my son's girlfriend. <end>
 B0009RT53M  Vermeil with Cubic Zirconia Chandelier Earrings ||	  Very nice  I was surprised when they were smaller than I thought they would be, but was actually glad about it because I was a little concerned they might be too heavy. They are the cutest earrings--very elegant--and I'm really very pleased with them. <end>  BEAUTIFUL!  Great price and well-made! These are not small earrings and will be noticed by others! Light-weight and fun to wear. <end>

Do not buy!!! <end>  This One Is A Keeper  As I do not care for gold necklaces, I always choose fine silver and this snake necklace is delicate, dainty, the right size, 20" and besides it looks fabulous around my neck no matter what pendant I put on it.

 B0009TNIH4  Replica of Sex and the City Charlotte CZ Ring ||	  Very shiny...  The CZ isn't too big and doesn't look overly fake. It's a nice ring, and it has lots of sparkle.I definitely recommend this ring if you are looking for some "fun" jewelry. <end>  Replica of Sex and the City Charlotte CZ Ring  The ring is simply amazing! I love it!! the shipping took only 1 week, I live in Austria, I was happly surprised when i got it so soon!! I can only recommend this product! <end>  Overall nice ring  This ring is really pretty. My only complaint is that, to me, the band on the picture looks bigger than it actually is. The ring I recieved seemed to have a smaller band which makes the bigger 'diamond' look really big. I like the ring though, it is very pretty. The ring was just a little different than I expected. Overall I would recommend it! <end>  stone is big  With this ring is only problem stone is too big. I expect something stylish and elegant. It is not it. <end>
 B0009V3TGC  X - Rose Quartz "Love" Power Bead Bracelet ||	  Very pretty and a good value for the money  I bought this for my friend's daughter (5yrs old)for her Christmas. She really enjoyed receving it and it was very tasteful for her to wear to church. <end>
 B0009V5WCQ  Sterling Silver Lapis Mother of Pearl Inlay Pendant Necklace ||	  Smaller than it looks  I got this as a gift for my Grandmother. She likes it very much as the mother of pearl goes with lots of colors. When it arrived, it was a bit smaller than it looks in the picture, but pretty none the less. <end>
 B0009V6374  GemGear Miracle Bead Volleyball Bracelet (7&quot;) Red/Silver ||	  Nice bracelet  Very nice bracelet. Beads are strung together on plastic strings so I'm sure you have to be careful not to pull on the beads too much. I was very happy with the way it looked. We received it super fast--which is good because the shipping was only $1 less than the item. <end>  NEVER received the bracelets  Do not go through what I did!!! I never received my order and they could care less. They canceled my order and told me they had no control over when the orders left. I waited patiently way too long just to have them act like whatever and just cancel it all on their own. <end>
 B0009VPSWA  Antique Inspired 5 Stones Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  Looks great!  This ring is the perfect size--not too big for my size 7 ring finger. The stones are beautiful and shiny, and they don't look fake. It's a very classy ring. <end>
 B0009WRV9M  Sterling Silver with Cubic Zirconia Round Matte Cufflinks ||	  beautiful, go with anything!  I was looking for some cufflinks for some time and was very specific about what I wanted. Round, mat, silver! This is it goes with anything and still looks feminine. <end>  clean and stylish  bought this for my son for christmas - I like them, I hope he does too!! They are simple yet classy and still very stylish for a "young" man. <end>
 B0009XDWGW  Kit Heath Celtic Double Trinity Knot Dangle Earrings ||	  Lovely tied knots  I gave these lovely earrings to my sweetheart for Christmas. She wears them all the time and just loves them. However, I thought the size seen in the pictures presented an image of something substantially larger than the actual earrings. I choose them because of the meaning of the Celtic double Knot. <end>  Great earrings!  I have gotten nice complements on these earrings. They are exactly as I ordered, they were shipped promptly and I enjoy showing my Irish heredity! <end>
 B0009XHNX0  14K White Gold Two Piece Diamond Engagement Ring 0.50 TCW ||	  Not happy  First the order was late in being delivered. After a few months the "white gold" plating began to chip away... <end>
 B0009XIH94  18K White Gold Diamond Semi Mount 0.26TCW ||	  Poor Quality  [...]To give this ring credit, it has a very nice curvy shape that compliments any diamond. Unfortunately looks aren't everything. The craftsmanship of this ring is extremely poor. The ridges around the diamonds are riddled with irregular gashes easily visible to the naked eye, as are the backs of the arcs. The diamonds are so small that they are barely even visible in the picture and in real life unless they are under some diamond lights. This is indicated in the .26 Ctw though so it shouldn't be a surprise. The worst part of this ring is the back, it is extremely thin and weak. I had my diamond mounted on the ring and inspected it closely after getting it back to make sure everything was right. Later that day I proposed and while removing the ring from my fiancee's hand and pulling slightly the back broke completely through in the thinnest part, which is about a millimeter. The amount of force involved was negligible.Now I have to get it repaired but it will just break again, so I have to get it reinforced and if that doesn't work I will have to buy a quality ring. And of course the 30 day return policy is useless because it is voided once the ring has been altered. In summary, I am extremely dissapointed with this product and its jeweler. <end>
 B0009XWXUI  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Oval CZ Earrings ||	  Not impressed.  I really was disappointed with these. They are quite large and fit oddly on my ear. Color not as I had hoped either...paler. <end>
 B0009Y58TU  Checkerboard Heart Lab Ruby and 10K Yellow Gold Pendant Necklace Gift Boxed ||	  Excellent for the price!  A pretty little piece, great for little girls especially! This is a fine piece for the price! Very small and fragile! <end>
 B0009YSXN8  Toe Ring - T12 - Crystal Band ~ Violet (Purple) ||	  Great ring  I love purple, so thing ring caught my attention. The price was good, so I bought it. It fits great and is very comfortable. It shines in the sun and stays put. Very happy with my purchase. <end>
 B0009YX6AI  Earrings - E371 - Sequin Pucci Style Dangle ~ Silver Tone ||	  Very pretty earrings  These earrings are not only beautiful, they are very light and comfortable. You barely know you are wearing them. <end>
 B0009YXDCO  Solid Sterling Silver 7mm Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Looks cheap  This ring is inexpensive yes...but should not look like you could get the same quality from a gum ball machine. <end>  Low Quality, Not Solid, Not Recomended  This ring arrived with visible fuse lines on the inside and outside. It is feather light, and is obviously hollow. Not "solid" whatsoever. Not worth the shipping, much less the cost of purchase. Probably not .925 sterling (couldn't have it tested, as there is not enough metal mass to have it done). <end>  Very pleased  I bought this ring as a temporary wedding band to wear during the last month of my pregancy (swollen fingers). I was a little concerned that it wouldn't be comfortable, but was pleasantly surprised - it is almost like a comfort-fit band. It is lightweight too. Excellent ring for the price! <end>  Great quality - quick service!  Ordered 2 silver bands as temporary wedding bands. They were shipped immediately and look great. <end>  GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY!  Being allergic to gold, it is hard for my husband and I to find quality silver at a good price. The ring is high quality, if a bit plain. It goes nice next to my flashy engagement ring, though! <end>  Lies, Low Quality  My first warning was the 'Made in China' tag I saw when removing this from the box. Obviously not solid, this is feather-light and started accumulating dents days after it first started being worn. And despite the '925' stamped on the inside, I doubt this is real sterling. It scratches far too easily.Still, it did look nice at first, shame you need to treat it like it's made of glass to keep it that way. I would have given this two stars if they didn't lie and claim it's solid sterling. <end>  ring review  the ring was beautiful, in perfect condition. My only complaint was that it came a week later than it said, but may be the postal services fault, I do not know. <end>  Not Solid  The ring is nice looking, and fits. It's hollow. I don't know what it means to say "solid" sterling silver, and maybe I'm just ignorant about jeweler's jargon, but solid to me means not hollow, and one hundred percent of the stated material.So the claim, as far as I can tell, is only half true.Obviously, this is not something that anyone in their right mind would pass off as an actual wedding band, to a lifetime partner. I bought it to wear for kicks, and it serves its purpose. <end>  You get what you pay for.  This looked very pretty. I wore it every day for about a month when I noticed it had a large dent in it. Not nearly as pretty as it appeared on the computer screen.No longer wear it. <end>  Silver Insanity BAD Company  I shopped for this ring and payed for it BUT I never received the ring> save your money and shop somewhere else. I sent several e-mails to the company and STILL no ring. Lousy COMPANY and BAD customer service. REALLY PEOPLE buy for some one else <end>  BEAUTIFUL ring!!!!  This ring is perfect! It actually looks BETTER than my real white gold wedding band. I got it really fast too. <end>  Will NEVER use again  A week after I got the product the edges began to turn black. And no, I'm not allergic because I have plenty of other rings made of sterling silver. Read others reviews and saw that they don't answer any emails, attempted anyway and to no avail. Shocker. So, I'm stuck with a craptastic ring that I paid money for. I would suggest not using them unless you intend to give it as a gift to someone you wish the worst for. <end>  amazon purchase-ring  looked all over for a ring like this and finally found it at amazon. it fits perfect and is beautiful. thank you. <end>  good ring  bought this as a temp ring for my new husband and he loves it .. <end>
 B0009YXRJ8  Antica Murrina Cuba - Black and White Murano Glass Ring ||	  Beautiful rin  Absolutely Beautiful ring! However extremely fragile. It actually broke when I first put it on over my knuckle (not even forcing it). Very disappointing. Considering whether I can salvage it at all. It is so beautiful that I may order another one. But beware these rings are very fragile. <end>
 B0009Z0T3O  Earrings - E364 - Sequin Dangle - Oval ~ Black ||	  Love the earrings  Earrings were as described. Will buy more later. Seller was so professional throughout.

 B0009ZAAD8  Reed & Barton Priscilla 413CR Jewelry Chest ||	  Quality jewelry box  This box has six non-slip feet on the bottom so it is sure to stay put. The drawer is divided into compartments - I have some of my chunkier necklaces, my earrings, and some miscellaneous jewelry pieces down here (like my extender). I love this jewelry box and the price was very fair for a nicely constructed, wooden jewelry box. <end>
 B0009ZAAK6  Katherine Cherry Jewelry Chest with Dior Red Lining ||	  Not made in USA  This item is not made in the USA, as the item's description states. I bought this item instead of others specifically because the seller claims that it is USA made. It is actually a Chinese made Reed & Barton jewelry chest, MSRP probably $180.Other than that error on the seller's part, this is a nice jewelry chest  good (though not flawless) finish, nice interior, decent craftmanship. <end>  Beautiful & well crafted!  I bought this as a gift for my wife & she loved it! It's beautiful - even more attractive than the picture - and very well made. The finish is smooth, the lining is soft and luxurious, and the rising tray is a wonderful way to add more space without increasing the size of the box.Highly recommended. <end>  Katie loved it!  I purchased this jewlry box for my 21 year old daughter, she loved it!My husband a skilled wood worker couldn't believe the quality and workmanship. He hesitantly admitted that it was a great value.Unfortunately, it did not arrive for Christmas, but weather conditions were to blame. <end>  Wifes Birthday Gift  Took a chance and was not disappointed. Well crafted, finished and functional. Was last minute birthday gift for wife and could not find an appropriate, well made and attractive dresser top jewelry box anywhere. This fit the bill perfectly and she was very happy (and a happy wife = happy husband). The flip up upper tray is a nice touch. Have yet to engrave the box top brass plate but will soon. <end>  Perfect  I just received my Reed & Barton Katherine Jewelry Box and it is beautiful, classy, high quality and has the perfect amount of storage. I am very pleased with the product and I am glad I ordered it. <end>
 B0009ZAAOC  Reed & Barton Iris 968WTS Jewelry Chest ||	  Beautiful Jewelry Box  We purchased this as a gift for our teenage daughter. The box is very large and has plenty of room for all her jewelry. Has a hanging section in the box lid for necklaces and two smaller drawers for rings and bracelets. The box is put together very nice and feels very solid and of high quality. I expect it to last for a very long time. Looks great in her room. <end>
 B0009ZETGM  Amazon.com  Peacock Pearls Sterling Silver Necklace and Earring Set - Pink and Light Pink  Clothing ||	  Picture  Its a nice pice of jewelry, but the pearls are smaller than what they appear to be on the picture. <end>  Beautiful set  The necklace and earring set are just beautiful--very delicate and in the softest pink. <end>
 B000A09UO2  Cute Stretchy Amethyst Chip Bracelet ||	  Nice fit  This is a nice little bracelet. It fits nicely, I have big wrist and it is hard to find bracelets that fit comfortably. I really like the stretch bracelets for this reason. <end>  Value for Money  Bracelets were better than I pictured them. Good size and very good price. <end>
 B000A09UQU  Cute Stretchy Leopard Skin Jasper Bracelet ||	  Another pretty Jasper stone color!  It is a nice Jasper stone. I have a pair of earrings that match it perfectly. What can I say, I like Jasper! <end>
 B000A0CILO  Cute Stretchy Labradorite Bracelet ||	  Great value but---  I was expecting this bracelet to be the size of the other Cool Styles bracelets. It is not. Hardly half an inch wide. Nicely strung, and the squares are matched in color and size. Only one or two flashes of the blue that we buy labradorite for. All in all a good value. <end>  AWESOME!  I liked this bracelet so much that I came back for a second one. Beautiful bracelet, fits perfectly and the price is amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! <end>  Labradorescence is cool  This labradorite tank bracelet is very attractive. Mine is a mossy green (colors vary) with flashes of other colors. <end>
 B000A0CILY  Cute Stretchy Leopard Skin Jasper Chip Bracelet ||	  Very Attractive  Just received two of these in today's mail, 11/13, having ordered them 11/7 using the least expensive method. They are very attractive leopard skin jasper chip bracelets. I am very pleased. <end>
 B000A0ERMM  Cute Stretchy Black Agate Bracelet ||	  Cool Style from CoolStyles  This bracelet is VERY shiny. The geometric design gives it a modern look. All of the stones are perfect.

This bracelet is comfy on the wrist--does not dig in, not too tight or too loose, does not get in the way (such as using a computer mouse). It is also very beautiful to look at (very sparkly) and is real stone! For reference, my wrist has a circumference of 6.25 inches. <end>
 B000A0ERPE  Cute Stretchy Mokite Chip Bracelet ||	  Great Gift Idea  These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit.

I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit.

 B000A0FKAK  Cute Stretchy Red Jasper Bracelet ||	  Beautiful Bracelet, Beautiful Price  The Red Jasper Bracelet by "Cute Stretchey Gems", is a very beautifulexample of the Gem stone. The red is a rusty red but very consistant all around. It fits a 7" wrist quite comfortably. <end>

 B000A0OVFA  Breitling Chronomat 405 ||	  Fell off on my first space walk  The crystal face of this watch began rattling during the stress of lift-off, and by the time we got into zero-G the hour-hand was floating around inside the case. Combined with the 2.5 hour sun cycles we experience on the Space Shuttle, the lack of a reliable time reference threw off my whole circadian rhythm and I puked up my liquified stroganoff lunch while trying to do a lunar observation. I blame the Breitling for that.On top of it all, during my first-ever EVA outside the Shuttle the wrist-band broke while I was waving to the camera. (You don't think I'm going to wear a $5000 watch INSIDE my suit where no one can see it, do you?) So my Breitling Navitimer is now in a slowly-decaying polar orbit and by NASA's calculations is scheduled to reenter Earth's atmosphere sometime in December 2011. I think the warranty will still be good by then, so if it burns up during reentry and the Navy can't recover it, those Breitling people are sure going to hear from me.I would NEVER take this watch into space again. I'm going back to Target for a Casio. <end>
 B000A0UU6Y  Solid Sterling Silver 6mm Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Silver Thumb Ring  Great little item - I wear it all the time! Great service, shipping and quality. <end>  flimsy tarnished ring.  I was not impressed. But, for the price, you can't beat it. However, if you DO beat it, it will most likely break on impact, due to the thin layer of metal this wring is made of. <end>  Good Product  I needed a ringfast----It came on time, it looks real good, what more could you ask for???? <end>  Great Engagement Ring  I bought this ring as an engagement ring for my finace. He felt left out that only I had one. He's planning on wearing it on his right hand after we get married. It looks like a regular wedding ring though and it's been holding up well after 2 and a half months of wear. <end>  rings  i needed a really cheap ring, really fast that would serve as a wedding ring that was lost and i got what i wanted and they are actually pretty on top of it all <end>  Nice  I didn't even keep the item, it wasn't needed, so I sent it back, but I am sure the product was great. The customer service was polite and kept me updated the whole way. <end>
 B000A0X8KY  Amazon.com  Dollar Necklace Accessory  Clothing ||	  Chain was too short  The chain was too short to slide through my large head. I opened up one of the chain links to disconnect the chain and reconnect the chain before I could wear it. Few inch or two extra chain length would have earned higher star reviews. <end>  Great  It was exactly what I expected. Metal Chain with plastic dollar sign. It went great with my Halloween costume. The only thing is that the chain doesn't open, so if someone has a big head they may not be able to fit it through. <end>  $ Necklace  It's plastic, but does the trick. The biggest problem the plastic chain is way to short. I can barley get it around my neck. I would try something with a longer chain. <end>
 B000A0XFJS  Solid Sterling Silver 5mm Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Lies, Low Quality  My first warning was the 'Made in China' tag I saw when removing this from the box. Obviously not solid, this is feather-light and started accumulating dents days after it first started being worn. And despite the '925' stamped on the inside, I doubt this is real sterling. It scratches far too easily.Still, it did look nice at first, shame you need to treat it like it's made of glass to keep it that way. I would have given this two stars if they didn't lie and claim it's solid sterling. <end>  Simple but Pretty.  I am a nursing student and I can not wear my original wedding ring during clinical rotations. I wanted a band that was simple but still pretty and that is exactly what I got. I am very happy with my purchase; the sizing was perfect and the ring is actually prettier in person than it is in the picture. The transaction was easy and the shipping was very quick. All in all an A++ purchase. <end>  Wedding Band results  I was very pleased with the ring it was just what I needed and I have people very interested in buying from here soon or in the future;thanks. <end>  I don't believe these to be 925 silver  disappointed that these rings (bought two) turn black while ON the hand. My tiffany's silver bracelet NEVER tarnishes while wearing it.. <end>  good  I really like the ring. it doesn't turn my finger green.they did send the wrong size i asked for a 7 and they sent a 6. only complaint. <end>  Not a cheap ring  This is a nice, simple silver band at a nice price and is in no way a "cheap" ring. <end>  Not as Durable as I Hoped  My girlfriend bought this for me, and it was beautiful and I was proud of it's simple elegance. However, I am very active, use tools, go to beaches, climb trees, and soon it was quite scratched. If you don't plan on being so rough with it, this is a great ring.(I went on to acquire a titanium ring which held up much better, albeit with a little less shine.) <end>  silverinsanity great silver ring  Terrific deal on quality silver! Love this ring and will buy again whenever I need silver! <end>  good bands  I really like these bands. they are heavy enough for resizing, and look great. they are not flashy and that is what I wanted. <end>
 B000A13Y8E  Tiny Sterling Silver Rabbit Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Rabbits  Great product but I thought they would be a little bigger.My sister loved them though.Thanks,James. <end>  Thrilled  They were for my wife for out 25th (Silver) wedding anniversary, she was thrilled with the rabbits. <end>
 B000A15UWW  Tiny Sterling Silver Texas Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Great Earrings, Fast Shipping  I ordered these as a gift for my sister who specifically requested stud earrings in the outline of Texas. I got the earrings yesterday, and they are exactly as pictured! Better yet, I ordered them on Friday, and they got here on Monday! I'm very pleased. <end>  Buy this item if you love Texas  The state of Texas earrings are cute and very affordable. A must have for anyone who loves Texas such as I do. The earrings are small, silver and one earring has the shape of Texas just right while the other one is going the opposite direction. <end>  Love'em!  Well made, gorgeous quality and craftsmanship, plus personalized service.What's not to love?Thank you for making these! They're absolute greatness! <end>
 B000A15WYI  Tiny Sterling Silver Ankh Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Subdued Goth  These earrings are small and conservative, but still have a certain edge. Work-goth perhaps? I actually got multiple pairs. The only problem I noticed is that on one of the pairs the earring came separated from the post. Also, be careful because the metal is thin and can bend under pressure (I wore it to a martial arts class and it got bent... but probably not designed to weather blows to the head...) <end>
 B000A15X5Q  Tiny Sterling Silver Horseshoe Stud Earrings ||	  Sabrina Silver  My experience in buying from Sabrina Silver was excellent. The earrings are even prettier in real life than they were pictured. Service was amazingly fast! I'm extremely pleased and will purchase again from this vendor! <end>
 B000A16Y40  Tiny Sterling Silver Mushroom Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Mushroom Stud earrings  Very high quality, each earring matched the other in quality. One was lost about a month after we bought it because backs would fall off. Not really a manufacturer problem though, my girlfriend just wears earrings 24/7 and the high quality silver is naturally soft. <end>
 B000A16YIQ  Tiny Sterling Silver Ball Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Never arrived  I ordered these and they never arrived. The seller told me to get some sort of paperwork from the USPS to prove that they didn't come, but they weren't expensive enough to warrant that much trouble on my part. I'd suggest they ship them via UPS or FedEx so it could be tracked. I bought similar ones elsewhere instead. <end>
 B000A19D16  Tiny Sterling Silver Spider Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Very cute!!!  My daughter wanted a pair of tiny spider earrings and these are just perfect. They have nice detail and are good quality sterling. <end>  Tiny Spider Ear studs  I really like the quality of the of the sterling spider ear studs. They hold up to all kinds of abuse which I was afraid they would not. They look good no matter which piercings I put them in. The only thing is that some people in society think they're ticks instead of spiders but that's those people's own stupidity. <end>  Great looking, but...  These are great, solid and quality feel, but the stud on them is short. A 210 lb. 6'1" tall guy, I found that the legs of the spider dug into my ears over a couple days, one cutting in. They're fine for wearing out for the day, but I can't leave them in 24 hours. <end>
 B000A19EI8  Tiny Sterling Silver Sun Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Love them  Great earrings, no complaints! Would buy again. I wear them all the time. They're the perfect size, look exactly as I expected. <end>  So cute  The earrings were bigger than I expected, but the face on the sun is quite cute. This is the second pair of earrings I have bought from Sabrina Silver and I will buy from them again  ) <end>  Just about right  These have worked out well, and were reasonably priced. I could wish the face was a little happier, but I would guess that the area is too small. They go well with the sun/moon earrings that I bought them to match. <end>
 B000A19GTA  Tiny Sterling Silver Saxophone Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  She was delighted.  Purchased for my child and given as a gift right before a concert. They are nicely crafted, very sturdy, and caused no irritation. The detail of the design is beautiful. <end>
 B000A19GW2  Tiny Sterling Silver Drama Masks Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Dainty  Very prompt service. Just right for my daughter who is 11 and on the drama team at her school. May be rather small for an adult. <end>
 B000A19GYA  Tiny Sterling Silver Cat Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Silver Cat Earrings  I was very excited to get these cute earrings for a cat lover friend of mine but was disappointed when I opened the box and they were extremely small. I'm not sure if it was in the description of the product and I read over it, but the size was too small. Luckily, she likes them and wears them in her second hole on her ear. <end>
 B000A19GYU  Sterling Silver Yin and yang Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Just as pictured  These earrings are just as nice as the photo. They are well made and came fast. My only wish was a better way to know the size, since they were a little larger then I expected. A comparision shot might be helpful. But they are WELL worth the price! <end>  Very nice earrings  I bought these earrings for my daughter as a Valentine's gift and she loves them. They are nice quality earrings at a very reasonable price. In addition, Sabrina Silver shipped them earlier than expected and was very responsive. <end>  Very well made  I really like these earrings. They are made very well and they are larger than what I thought they would be. I'm very pleased with them! Great price too! <end>
 B000A19H1C  Small Sterling Silver Ankh Non-Pierced Nose Ring (one piece) 1/2 inch ||	  Ankhalicious  I love this product. The symbol of life!!! I bought plenty to share with my friends and family alike. Thank you. <end>  Cute  A nose ring without getting pierced is worth giving a try. I would suggest giving this a try if you would like to know how you would look with a piercing with spending a lot of money getting it done. It is light weight and easy to adjust. If I want to dress a little funky, this just adds to my appearance. I definitely would recommend trying this out. <end>
 B000A19H26  Small Sterling Silver Tomahawk Non-Pierced Nose Ring (one piece) 1/2 inch ||	  Review of Axe nose ring  Review of axe nose ring  Overall I did not like this product.Pros Made of silver as advertised.shipped promptly by vendor.Good detail, and antique finish.Cons Weak construction, lost unit because it would not hold its shape.Cuff and bead finish very rough, very hard on the inside of nose.Stem needs to be longer and extend up the back side of the unit to the axe head.Bead needs to be mounted the other way to help secure it when adjusted. Stem needs to be heavier with better attachement to axe, this is where it broke. <end>
 B000A1ADEW  Tiny Sterling Silver Dog Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  So cute!  The earrings arrived fast. They were well packaged, and substantial (yet tiny, as advertised)metal content. I know my daughter will love them. (X-Mas gift) <end>  Precious!  Super cute earrings! Very small (description says "tiny" and this is true) but ADORABLE. My 6 year old dog lover loves them. Totally one of a kind! <end>
 B000A1BHZ6  Tiny Sterling Silver Lady Bug Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Not for young ears!!!  We bought these cute stud earrings for our 5 year old daughter who loves lady bugs. They are quite small however and three days after she put them in her ears I noticed that the pointed tops of the lady bugs had actually disappeared into her ear. We were able to carefully remove them but we won't have her wear them again. These are really quite cute and would be lovely for an older child or adult who's ears are not so soft still. They would be perfect for a cartilage piercing! <end>
 B000A1BLXY  Tiny Sterling Silver Drop Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Ya get watcha pay for.  Cheap. Sharp edges. Pretty large in size. Not satisfied, but what did I really expect for such a low price? <end>
 B000A1BMAQ  Sterling Silver Ear Cuff Earring (one piece) with Ball Stud and Chain 1/2 inch ||	  Chain and ball stud are delicate, watch it...  I received this two days before the expected delivery range began. It looks very nice overall, except that the chain is extremely thin and delicate and the ball stud was smaller than I expected (it matches the picture exactly; I just didn't look at the photo very carefully). So handle it with care. I was fitting the cuff on my ear and had to open it a little wider--I was so afraid that it would break--but the cuff is tough enough so that it opened slowly, with some determination from me. It's tough yet pliable and holds the shape very well. It doesn't pinch at all.I was surprised that the chain was so short (roughly 3.5 cm, an inch and then some) and for the time being I've replaced the original chain/stud with my own chain and stud. The original chain is indeed quite short and dangles just below the ear, so if you want it to be more noticeable I recommend that you replace the original chain with a longer one (you can buy lengths of chain and ball studs at craft stores).I'm actually returning this cuff because I prefer to have them in pairs. For that I would personally recommend "Sterling Silver Coiled Wirework Ear Cuff Pair Earrings" by Silver Insanity, also found on Amazon. It's only $4.99 + $4.99 shipping for two ear cuffs (cheaper than paying $12.58 for this one) and I plan to attach my own chains and studs. That's just me, though. If you're fine with wearing just one at a time instead of two, this is a great item. No complaints, for the most part. A great product! <end>  Awesome!  Of all the ear cuffs I have, this one is probably my favorite. It's the perfect size for my ear, and the chain gives it just a hint of punk. Plus, I don't have to worry about it falling off my ear because of the post. It's really comfortable to wear, and I've gotten a lot of good comments. It's the perfect addition to anyone's style!Great shipping, and an all-around awesome seller! A+ <end>  Awesome ear cuff  This is a very lightweight, moldable ear cuff. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas. She is not much on jewlery, but this cuff is something she wears almost everyday. It has attitude and style, something that is often missing from earrings.Love it! <end>  Bleh  The proportions are a little off and it does not come with another stud earring for the other ear; it should be worth no more than 5 dollars but oh well. <end>  looks cool  these earring look cool and unique.the item arrived before the expected delivery date.the quality is exelent and good value for money.you can find videos on the internet that show you how to put them on if you have never worn ear cuffs before.they are quite comfortable to whare but be carefull when towl drying your hair. <end>  I love this earring  The weight is minimal. The earring itself is gorgeous. It's rather sturdy for it's design. And I love it. But sometimes it does pinch and you want to be careful when adjusting the size of it because it is a light and flexible metal so you might work it too hard. So far I haven't broken it or anything, but I'm also really leery of doing just that. <end>  Cool Ear Cuff!  I bought this ear cuff for my nephew for Christmas. He put it on immediately upon receiving it. It looked so good on him, I bought one for myself! <end>  Very charming  Unfortunately not as dark as in the picture... but still very nice! Looks exactly like what's in the picture. Very easy to manipulate. String's length is great; doesn't get in your way. (Of course, if you have bigger ears though, it could pull your ear a little. so, check with the seller. Sabrina Silver's answers and delivery were done very quickly. I don't even live in the same country as her!) <end>  It's pretty, but..  I received my order today, and I was so excited that I rushed into the bathroom to try on the earcuff. But there's a problem. The earcuffs (not one out of the three I bought) fit. Not one. Perplexed, I looked up instructions on how to put them on, in case I was doing it wrong, you know? But I was putting it on right. Its a fuss putting on this one and the little one with the feather, and both of them are too small so they pinch and squeeze the sides of my ear. I guess Sabrina Silver doesn't understand that ever individual ear is different. How disappointing... <end>
 B000A1CKAW  Tiny Sterling Silver Pineapple Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Great little earings  I'm sure pineapples are a niche market, but these fine little beauties fit the bill. Not over powering, just right. <end>  Pretty little earrings  Purchased these as a gift for my niece. They are just as cute as described and she loved them. She has an allergy to some earrings and these did not bother her at all. <end>
 B000A1CKGG  Tiny Sterling Silver Tongue Stud Earrings 1/4 inch ||	  Better than the picture  These earrings caught my attention, they are so quirky. Smaller than I expected but they look even better than the picture. <end>
 B000A1CKIY  Tiny Sterling Silver Cross Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  My favorite earrings yet!  I was skeptical when i ordered these. but once they came in the mail i fell in LOVE! also everyone who has seen me with them on loved them! <end>  Good earrings, might be cheaper at Fredmyers...  At Fredmyers, in the jewelry section, this pair comes in a pack of 3 different pairs of earrings. I don't remember how much I bought it for (I think it was cheaper than what the price is offered here), but they ARE tiny studs, and very cute.Easy to put on and take out the back finding. No problems with the earrings. <end>  Nice product, good service  The product arrived alright along with the other one I ordered from Sabrina Silver Tiny Sterling Silver Cross Stud Earrings. I'm already wearing my stud in a freshly-pierced ear, everything is great, I like the way it looks and feels.I provided the wrong address when I first ordered these items. So I made another order and contacted the seller about refund for the first one. Got a reply within 24 hours with the confirmation that the refund will be made as soon as my first order arrives back. I might not have noticed the refund (too many transactions), but I guess I got it alright. Or will get someday. <end>
 B000A1COKS  Ohio State Buckeyes belly ring ||	  Nice quality, but design was off  I ordered this thinking that it would be red and silver (OSU colors) but when I received it, the border was black which isn't depicted in the picture shown. I kept it just because it's a good quality and I didn't want to mess with sending it back but if you are looking for the true colors of OSU, I wouldn't get it. <end>
 B000A1EK50  Tiny Sterling Silver Padlock Stud Earrings 1/4 inch ||	  Awesome earrings  I purchased these to wear in my 3rd set of piercings, and they are the perfect tiny size for that. They look very cute! Nice detail to be so tiny. These are one of my favorite pairs of studs! <end>
 B000A1EK96  Tiny Sterling Silver Heart w/ Arrow Stud Earrings 3/8 inch ||	  Ai...not that good  These earrings are pretty and all, but they are way too tiny. Noone will be able to see them expecially if you have long hair. The earrings are a bit smaller than one of my fingernails. If they were a whole lot bigger i would of liked them but as of now it was just a waste...I wouldnt suggest buying these earrings unless they are for a little toddler. <end>
 B000A1IBD2  Braided 2mm Black Silk Cord ||	  Perfect!  I purchased a tribal "pendant" but didn't like the leather and rubber necklace cords the merchant had on hand. So, I did a little searching on Amazon and found this beauty. Nice and smooth against the skin, doesn't look dorky like rubber, and doesn't give off that funky smell leather does.Closes with a chinese-button type of "clasp" - basically a stylized knot at one end slips through a small loop at the other end. Cool idea and have never had the necklace fall off, even after sleeping with it on. <end>
 B000A2EWJS  Sterling Silver with Pink Cubic Zirconia Heart Ring ||	  pink heart ring  This ring is beautiful. Great detail. Have received many compliments on it. Looks very expensive, but thanks to you very affordable. Thanks <end>

 B000A3QROK  Unusual Old World Style Sterling Silver 3-Stone Amethyst Leaf Choker Necklace ||	  My Wife Wears It Regularly  I bought this as one of several inexpensive pieces of Jewelery for my wife last Christmas. She not only said she liked it when she opened the package but I now see her wearing it on a pretty regular basis. That to me says it was a good choice. Some of my other jewelery gifts haven't faired nearly as well. <end>
 B000A3TCY2  Sterling Silver Italian Snake Chain Necklaces & Bracelets light 1.2mm Nickel Free, Sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Beautiful  I love ordering from Sabrina Silver . product is always as described and she ships very quickly.

I was looking for an "almost choker" necklace. I would really like a wider one, but this one will do. <end>  silver chain  I purchased a sterling silver Italian snake chain bracelet. I'm allergic to anything with nickle so this worked nicely. It was shipped quickly and exactly what I ordered at a very reasonable price. I would buy from this vendor again. I have never been disappointed with an item I have ordered through Amazon. <end>  Just what I was looking for  I have had this chain for about a week now, and I wear it 24 hours. I bought the 14" one, and it sticks to the neck - which is what I wanted. It's hard to find the 14" length in stores and was glad to find it here on Amazon. The chain is thick, all nice and silvery and I like that it's nickel free. The shipping was quick as well. Thank You! <end>  Sterling Silver 1.2 mm snake chain (14")  Purchased three of these chains for grandchildren. They are absolutely beautiful but 2 or the 3 chains broke at the point where the chain is joined to the ketch.I would have given these chains with 5 stars but I do not know why the chains failed. (i.e. If grandchildren mishandled or if chains had a poor connection joint.) <end>  Poor Quality  Had this for only a couple of months or so and it's already broken. It only ever received occasional, light wear. The chain snapped clean through. Do not waste your money. <end>  Good buy!  I had metal allergy, so I was looking for nickel-free chain. I bought 18", and it's good length for me. Fast shipping, good packing. I really like it, and am happy because I don't need to wear old silver chain.(Of course, it includes nickel!) <end>  Very nice necklace  I ordered this chain as a replacement for another chain I already had but broke, and I'm happy with the purchase.

 B000A6SORA  Forzieri Violet Swarovski Crystal Silver Plated Cufflinks ||	  Amazing cufflinks - very bling!  I received these for Christmas from my Amazon wish list, and I am very impressed. The pictures online do not do them justice -- the crystal is amazingly reflective and sparkling, and faces of the links are bigger than I expected (the dimensions listed are probably right, but the picture online isn't nearly as big as they are in real life). Also, the picture online seems to show a copper-colored layer in between the crystal and the link. Mine don't have that -- the base is all silver, which makes more sense.Overall, I'm very pleased with this gift. I'd recommend these to anyone who likes to wear french cuff shirts and has evening occasions where a little 'bling' would be appropriate. I'm even thinking about getting the aqua-colored ones, as well. <end>

Nice shine to it, too. <end>  Awesome!  This ring is awesome! My husband loves it.It's a nice wide ring, it looks better in person.Was also very pleased at how quickly it was delivered.Great price as well. <end>  thank goodness  i bought this just days before christmas, and it got here days before and was in perfect condition <end>  Unfortunate  The product was poorly crafted, the edges uneven, and overall a disappointment. The photo does not accurately reflect the thickness of the ring. The seam where the two ends were joined was blued from sodering and incomplete. The only saving grace was that I didnt spend much. <end>  Purchase  This was the worst ring ever...I wore it about 12 hours and it turned my finger green!! What a complete waste of money.....DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM! <end>  Best Silver..  I would highly recommend this company to anyone. They get it to you on time, every time. This is my 4th purchase with them and they never disappoint! You get exactly what you see, with great quality. <end>  G R E A T  Perfect wedding ring , it look nicer when i put it on.nice shining with perfect finishing.also its width is great for a man with a big hand . <end>  Great ring, wearing it now, fast delivery as well!!  Very nice ring which I am wearing now. It is a very nice compliment and it gets good reviews from everyone! <end>

 B000A8N1QC  925 Sterling Silver Brilliant-Cut 3 Stone CZ Ring ||	  Cheap looking...  I've been looking around for a nice, 3 stone ring like this one for quite a while now. I finally settled on this one because of the picture. And by looking at the picture of this ring online - you might be misled like I was into thinking it doesn't look like a cheap ring. Don't be fooled. It looks terrible.After spending about $40 on this ring plus shipping, I am very displeased with this ring. It really does look like it came out of a quarter machine. The stones look like plastic (they don't shine and look like very poor quality cubic zarconia), and the band itself looks like cheap metal that would break easily if enough pressure was applied. I could get a better ring from Wal-Mart for $15 that looks better then this one - and I am serious. I'm very unhappy with this ring.A definite return of this item... Don't waste your money. You really wont like it. <end>

 B000AAUKPK  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver Polished Dolphin Toe Ring ||	  To big!  It is to big for a toe ring but works for a pinky ring. But I still really like it a lot. I have it on all the time even right now. <end>  Nothing out of this world but okay  I'm using it on my little finger on my hand. It doesn't quite stay on as a toe ring, but it was cheap, so it is what it is. <end>  So much fun to wear....  I love THIS little toe ring, (I bought several others), they are so cool to wear! It's my "little secret" ring. The rings do stay put, I was worried about them falling off, comfortable, adjustable for any toe. This seller has a really good selection to choose from, can't buy just one! Ships fast, fair shipping price, great PRICE deals on the rings! I want more! I will come back to goldfinger jewelry again. And again........ <end>
 B000AAURQM  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver Antiqued Skull Toe Ring QR796 ||	  Cute Little Ring!  Very cute little toe ring. Easy to adjust and comfortable fit. I had a problem simply because once I put it on, I leave it on and unfortunately I was pretty hard on it.But if you are one that is more careful with your jewelry, it should last you a long time and I would recommend it. After all, the price is right!xoxMEF <end>
 B000AAWLYI  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver Antiqued Lizard Cubic Zirconia Toe Ring ||	  I love the lizard!  For years I wore this lizard toe ring. Never took it off. Then last year it disappeared off my toe never to be seen again.So of course I checked Amazon and found another toe ring. I was thrilled with it although it was a tad bigger than the one I had. Oddly enough I lost this one while in the river a few weeks later.Despondent over yet another loss, again I checked Amazon and found this one. It has a little crystal in it, but not gaudy. It was also half the price as the previous one. So not wanting to go through this again, I ordered 2 of them.I am totally delighted over the look and quality of these rings. And so far, I'm still wearing the first.If you're wanting a lizard toe ring, I definitely recommend this one! <end>
 B000ABADD8  Sterling Silver Two Heart, Toe Ring ||	  silver ring  This product is good. I enjoy it, its pretty and got here really fast, was exactly what i had wanted. But my only problem with it is that after i've worn it in the shower a few days the silver started coming off and not its just kinda an ugly grey color around some of the edges. <end>
 B000ACYVEO  Celtic Knot Antiqued Sterling Silver -Toe Ring ||	  Love it!  I wear it every day. Fits my skinny toe. It also adjust to any toe size. <end>
 B000AD0X4K  San Diego Chargers belly button ring ||	  A must for Charger Girls!  Pretty much what you expect, haven't found any structural flaws or such, and it looks cute on my girlfriend, so all is well. <end>
 B000AD5ASO  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver Antiqued Claddagh Toe Ring ||	  versatile ring  this is an incredibly versatile ring. I can wear it on my toes but no one sees it in the winter. I can fit it on any of my fingers because it's adjustable so much that you bend it straight or inside out. I can wear it as a fake piercing too. I already have my lip pierced but I can use it as a snake bite or an eyebrow or anywhere on my ear and on my nostril or septum (between the nostrils). the only qualm I have is that the ring's claddagh symbol is rather small, just about the width of the ring, so you have to get kind of close to me to tell what it is. it's really awesome though, I really like being able to extend it, especially because I have really thick (like sausage links) toes and fingers.Great product, came within 10 days on reg. ground shipping. well packed, in a little box with bubble wrap. would recommend product to anyone. <end>  Irish Loyalty  Please, read the history behind the claddagh ring. I think it's an insult to its meaning to wear it as a toe ring. It's not just another pretty ring it has meaning and it should be worn properly. PLEASE wear it right and show a little Irish pride and loyalty. <end>
 B000AD5AZC  Toe Ring - Dangle Heart .Sterling Silver ||	  Okay, but...  This is very cute and inexpensive, but the ring that attaches the heart is kinda big and will hurt your toe or get bent if it touches any part of your shoe or sandal. <end>  Cutest Toe Ring Ever!  This is a beautiful item. It's very comfortable but secure. I don't have to worry about it coming off. It's so cute and I've received several comments on it. It's the most precious thing you could ever want to buy. <end>
 B000AED0E4  14kt White Gold Ruby Cross Pendant - XWR173 ||	  Not worth the money.  I thought this would be the perfect gift for a Catholic male friend, thinking it was probably a few inches long, maybe an inch wide. When I received it in the mail, it was positively microscopic, only about a 1/2 inch long, very tiny, about as big as my thumbnail. Did I say it was small? This was suitable for a little girl's dainty necklace, perhaps even a charm bracelet. For the price, this was unacceptable, it should have been much larger and more impressive. I'm sure the length was somewhere in the advertisement, but it escaped me entirely, and I was very disappointed. Be warned! Thanks to Amazon for crediting my account very quickly, which makes me happy to continue shopping with them. <end>
 B000AHICUI  Sterling Silver Vine Pendant, 18" ||	  Great gift  Gave this to my sister for Christmas. She loves it. Unique and goes with lots of outfits. It's defintiely quite a big pendant. But that's a good feature - it has a bold look. <end>  bigger than i thought  watch out! this necklace is bigger than it looks. It is about 1.5" tall (pendant only). <end>  Pendant  I purchased this as a gift for mu niece and she thought it was so pretty. She liked to weight and she says it is staying nice. <end>  jewelry  I sent for a silver pendant, and it arrived just fine. No problems. And it's nice. <end>  Really striking and beautiful piece.  I have received more compliments on this one piece--from *everybody*, even people who don't usually exhibit interest in jewelry or wardrobe--than I have on any other pendant I own. It is large, but the elongated rectangle shape coupled with the airspace inherent in the design helps to make it not appear too large. I am petite and I don't have any problems pulling it off. It's bold, but not aggressive--it has a gentleness, and though it's very contemporary, it has a primitive organic quality. It looks much more expensive than it is, too--a real *piece of jewelry.* And I like the neckwire--the pendant never hangs crazy on me and the clasp stays at the back of my neck where it belongs, and it looks graceful on, even with my short neck. <end>  Vine Pendant  I just received this today. Somehow I completely missed that the pendant is on a silver-wrapped wire and not a chain. Had I noticed that, I probably would not have ordered this piece - and I would have missed out. It is very nice. It has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but substantial. The wire lays on my neckline just right, and the pendant looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with it. <end>  Vine and Branches  I was impressed with the quality of this pendant including the packaging! I've received several complements on the quality and unique design. For me it signifies John 15 5 "I am the vine and you are the branches..."I am very pleased with this fine piece of jewelry. Thank you! <end>  Fabulous pendant.  This is a beautiful piece. Very substantial and unusual! The only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on. Regardless, it was well worth the price. <end>  Beautiful pendant, but...  As has been said in previous reviews, the chain that comes with this beautiful pendant is less than satisfactory. Actually, it's awful. Pretty much unwearable. However, this is a perfect gift if you have a better chain, or your ladyfriend is a jewelry maker (like myself). <end>  Beautiful, but you'd better have a thin neck!  In person this lovely necklace looks even better than the pictures. It is larger than it looks on the site but it is very striking and looks great on. However, the ring that it comes with to wear is VERY tight - plan on taking the pendant off the ring and wear it with your own chain.It is definitely worth the money, especially since the price dropped. <end>  larger than expected  This is a beautiful necklace, however it was larger than expected. Definately for people who want a bold look. <end>  Only one downfall  Surprisingly, this pendant was larger than it seemed...and that was a bonus. The "chain" however is a wire wrapped in silver. I love the way it lays and keeps the clasp at the back of my neck, has its own style and feel, and goes beautifully with the pendant. It will, however, BEND. I mean, it will be gorgeous, then have a 60degree bend in it. The good news (if this is a good thing) is that you can 'un bend' it. I wear this at work and out on weekends and it seems strongly made. For the money, I am pleased with it and will order from this vendor again. <end>  Attractive but large  The pendant is really quite nice but be aware that it is larger than you may expect. I read other reviews before purchasing and expected it to be a bit large but was surprised at how big it actually is. Looks great on my girlfriend though and she is only 5'2. Rope cord it comes with arrived with crimps in spots. Plan on getting a seperate chain/rope. <end>  Amazing Pendant  This is a beautiful pendant,I love it and get compliments on it almost every time I wear it. Make sure you know that the size is as described, 1.5 inches long. The chain is fine, a little stiff due to the length, but very wearable and looks good. Arrived in a nice padded box as well. <end>  Great piece at a better pricepoint.  I selected this necklace as a Christmas present for my sister-in-law and was pleasantly surprised with the quality for the pricepoint. Having managed a quality control department for a jewelry company some years ago, I can be wary about ordering jewelry online- it's hard to know if the piece you'll receive will look as nice as the photograph you're judging on the screen! A simple pendant that's also a little out of the ordinary- I'm considering buying one to wear on a longer snake chain for myself. I'd buy jewelery from Amazon's collection again! <end>  Simply Stunning  Oh how I love this necklace! I get more compliments on it! Its appealing to the artsy, to the funky, to the trendy, even bikers dig this piece. I wear it out socially or to work. It is really a classy and versatile piece. Its different too, because its on the larger side, with its rectangular shape. Its lovely as a gift to someone or just for you! <end>  Gets Compliments  I love this Necklace. It has a great weight and feel about it. It is so simple it can dress up or be funky. <end>  Lovely but large.  This is a lovely abstract pendant that arrives shiny and striking. However, the one I ordered came on a chain that was more like a cord and was kinked upon arrival.It truly is a striking piece, just a little to large for my frame. <end>  Beautiful, flattering pendant can be moved to another chain  A beautiful pendant and necklace, compatible with many outfits. Bright shiny silver, but not too much bling. A classic look, which will not go out of style.As other reviewers mentioned, it is a large pendant, almost 2 inches tall including the bail-loop, and 3/4 inch wide. The chain is a smooth wire style, which I like. However, the chain was almost too short for my thick neck, so I switched the pendant to a chain I already owned, which was a couple inches longer. It was easy to slide the pendant off the chain and onto another. The bail-loop (for hanging the pendant) is wide enough to fit most chains, except not the big chunky rapper-style chains.Inside the usual plain Amazon delivery carton, the necklace arrived with both a box and a bag  a small, navy-blue jewelry-style box, and a small purple velveteen bag with drawstring closure. With the nice presentation it is suitable as a gift.I liked the style of this pendant so much, that I ordered another pendant in a very similar pattern, but a much smaller size, to wear with outfits that need a small pendant. If you want to see that smaller pendant, do a search on Amazon ID number B0015DX6HA; just put B0015DX6HA in the search box near the center top of the page. That smaller pendant is about an inch tall and 1/3 of an inch wide; but it has a longer chain in a different style that seems more delicate. <end>  LOVE IT  I got this necklace as i gift - which I picked out!And I love it...I get so many compliments on it everytime I wear it.It's unique and beautiful, and goes with anything.It's a piece that makes a statement. <end>  Nice piece!  I bought this as a gift and she loved it. She receives compliments about it all the time. She also wears it casual and dressy. The necklace part is just flexible wire, but it is not as bad as others have stated. <end>  Gorgeous!  This pendant was worth every penny. The photo does not do it justuce.Even though measurements are listed, it looks more substantial in person. I love it. <end>  graceful and beautiful necklace  My son bought this necklace for me as a present. It is elegant in its simplicity, and evokes the idea of trees reaching toward the sky. Whenever I have worn this necklace it has always gotten positive comments from others. Wearing this necklace mades me feel that I am wearing a piece of jewelery that reflects something essential about how I love nature and the idea of reaching toward the sky. The necklace I received is excellently crafted. This necklace has my highest recommendation. I hope it brings you the joy it brings me. <end>  Great Necklace  Its a nice necklace my finace loved it and with the shorter chain it hangs where she likes. <end>  Vine Pendant  Beautiful, substantial piece. Weighty but not too heavy. Have received many compliments on it. <end>  Fabulous & Unique!  I ordered this stunning sterling silver vine pendant last month, and I've worn it a few times and received several compliments on it. I'm so happy I purchased this beautiful piece. <end>  Fabulous  Purchased this on a whim, but it's great! Read the other reviews about the chain (which is not actually a chain), but if you're ok with that, it's a great piece. A little larger than I normally wear, but simple enough to not be overwhelming. I love it. <end>  beautiful & unique  It's larger than I thought, shiny, great choker type chain. Lots of complements. I love it! <end>  Sterling Silver Vine Pendant, 16"  Better than I expected. The pendant is large, but not too big and really makes a great accessory when paired with tops or dresses that are not too busy. Excellent quality--they did not skimp on the silver. The silver choker is perfect length and very comfortable--good clasp. I've received lots of compliments--would make a great gift. <end>  Beautiful!  This is a really gorgeous necklace - I've already gotten tons of compliments and have only worn it twice! Like others have said, it is very large, so it goes better with simpler tops, but the design element of the vines makes it feel very organic, and it has a nice weight to it, which gives high marks for quality. <end>  Large silver pendant  Very nice piece, just beware of the size, it's much bigger than it appears in this picture.It does hang nice on the silver cord, however, the clasp is backwards, and with the cord, it does not flex to the correct position. <end>  Great Gift  I bought this gift for my sister-in-law and it was beautiful. It is high quality and looks great. <end>  Good choice.  Good piece of silver for any occasion, I hope I will be satisfied. I don't know what else I should write. <end>  Way too big!  I ordered this necklace and it was pretty but it was huge! Not at all to my taste, and the chain is an odd cable, very industrial looking. <end>
 B000AHICUS  Sterling Silver Organic Circle Pendant, 18" ||	  Circle Pendant  This Pendant is on the cheap looking side - but you get what you pay for I guess. <end>  silver pendant  I bought this to save for a Christmas gift.It is a very nice looking piece of jewelry. <end>  Very pretty  I ordered this pendant because I wanted the chain, but the pendant is very pretty and well worth the price. <end>  Love IT!  Necklace was a pleasant surprise but exactly what I was hoping. Good quality for price not cheap and flimsy <end>  Excellent for the price  Got this on the Gold Bx Deal of the Day and my girlfriend loved it! Circles were even larger than I expected. <end>  Circle Pendant  I came in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected. The person that received it loved it. <end>
 B000AHICVW  Sterling Silver Rain-Drop Earrings ||	  simple earrings  nice earrings - delicate earrings; good length for a person who is not sure they could wear dangling earrings <end>
 B000AHU4UE  Ankle Bracelet - Sterling Silver Polished Antiqued Black Cats Eye Diamond Anklet (9 inch) ||	  Love it  This is beautiful, I ordered the 9in length and it was still a little big so I removed 2 of the links and it fits perfect. <end>
 B000AJBA96  Best Quality Luxury Useful Gift Present for Her - 12" Qing Rosewood Jewelry Box w/ 5 Drawers & Shou Symbol ||	  Oriental Jewelry Chest  I have been looking for a beautiful yet unique chest for my jewelry. This is beautifully done. The cream-colored felt lining is a compliment to the laquered finish in Rosewood. Along with the beautifully carved Asian symbols, the brass fixtures are slightly oxidized, giving this piece an old-world facade. The chest is roomy and organized. It comes with unique locking mechanisms, not pictured in this photo. The chest is quite lovely, a real treasure. <end>
 B000AL9PVE  Oakland Raiders belly button ring ||	  Perfect gift for Raider's Fan  This was a perfect gift for a certain Raider's fan in my family and she absolutely Loved it! It was the perfect size and length and looked really cute on her. She received many complements on it too! <end>
 B000ALAN4M  Nickel Free Rhodium Plated Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Band Butterfly Animal Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Butterfly Ring  I thought this ring was very pretty. Doesn't look much like a butterfly but it's still pretty on my hand. <end>  NO not gonna do it for me  This is DAINTY, PETITE, TINY. It is a little girl or pre-teen ring! I am 5 foot 4 and 125 lbs and a size 6 and have very little fingers. This is small butterfly design wise AND size wise! I have about 150 size 6 rings THAT FIT FINE this one has to be a 5 and a half! If I were to wear it it would get stuck and an ambulance would have to come and paramedics would have to remove it from my swollen, purple finger. The butterfly IS exquisite don't get me wrong. Very pretty! Looks like real diamonds but it doesn't say the dimensions here in the description. It should be a half an inch at least to have any wow factor but it HAS TO BE SMALLER THAN THAT like a little girl's ring like I mentioned before. It has to go back and i am SO UPSET! This was my Mother's Day gift! I had e-mailed these people ASKING is it ran small too! They had no clue! The picture of the ring on the finger of the manequin or whatever it is is VERY deceiving. If any of my children were older I would give it to them but I don't know one single person small enough to wear this ITTY BITTY TEENY WEENY RING! SHOCKINGLY SMALL! I MIGHT exchange for a bigger size we'll see. It came really fast. All the stones are there. Good workmanship. The design is nice. It isn't all bad. I am just mad I can't wear it and nobody would notice it anyway I am thinking, as microscopic as it is! If you are 5 foot and under 100lbs go for it! <end>  DELICATELY BREATHTAKING!  I have not taken the ring off since it arrived...love the ring...the quality and design are superb and it sits nicely on the finger. I have received numerous compliments and would highly recommend this ring to everyone...as a gift or for yourself! Glitzy but not garrish! A must for any woman! <end>
 B000AMA2VK  14K White Gold Pre Set Diamond Bridal Ring Set (3-piece ring set) ||	  What a find!  I chose this three-piece wedding for myself and it was all that I hoped for and more! The picture does it no justice! The white gold is shiny and the diamonds are white and sparkly! Alex, from Jewelry Days, went out of his way to answer my questions and provide support. I had the ring checked by my jeweler and he gave it "two thumbs up," for both quality and price!! Order it -- you will be happy that you did! I just can't wait to start wearing it! <end>
 B000AMERF2  14K White Gold 1/4 ct. Diamond Men's Wedding Band (Higher Quality) ||	  Great Choice!  The ring looks great. My husband loves the quality. Our only issue was that the ring only came in one size. <end>
 B000AMV4N0  Sharper Image Deluxe Ultrasonic Jewelry Cleaner & Tarnish Remover ||	  My jewelry looks awesome  If you want your jewelry to looks it's best, you have to buy one. This is an excellent jewelry cleaner. I have used the unit to clean small and large pieces of jewelry. Ultrasonic cleaning is great for getting into the knooks and crannies of your jewelry that you can't reach. The unit produces 42,000 ultrasonic waves per second which is the best you will get unless you buy a professional model which would cost a heck of a lot more. I still take my jewelry to my jeweler every 6 months to be steam cleaned and make sure no stones are loose, but this product saves me tons of money in between visits by getting my pieces clean and leaving them beautifully sparkley.UDPATE  I had to exchange this item 3 times due to the tank cracking. The first time it happened I thought it was strange as I am very careful with the unit. Unfortunately, it cracked two more times & as it stands the tank has cracked again. Since my warranty is up I can no longer exchange it. There are many comments about the tanks cracking on several jewlery forums. Sharper Image needs to look into this as there is something malfunctioning in these units that is causing the cracking. <end>  Flashier package, but still an amateur device  The tank size (which is intentionally omitted from the product description) is too small for large jewelry or sunglasses. To find a real ultrasonic device, search the web for "cavitation +ultrasonic jewelry cleaner." This is an amateur ultrasonic cleaner in a "designer" plastic package, designed for sale to those who haven't done their homework on ultrasonics. <end>  Fits all my jewelry, cleans it really well  This jewelry cleaner fits all my jewelry, even my largest necklace. I can clean lots of earrings at the same time, and not have to dip my fingers in the solution to get them out since the cage is removable. I love the watch holder, which allows me to clean the band without getting the watch face wet. Anyway, my jewelry looks like new again, so I'm more likely to wear it. <end>  Good jewelry cleaner for the price  I researched ultrasonic cleaners last year and got this one for my wife. She is VERY happy with it. The other cheaper ones didn't appear to do anything according to the reviews. The professional ones probably work better; however, they are also much more expensive. With this one, you can see the dirt coming off of the jewelry. It comes with cleaning solution and works better with the solution. My wife reuses the solution until it is really dirty, after 1 year she still has 1/2 a bottle left. She uses it for rings, necklaces, and bracelets. <end>  Just OK  This product was just average due to it's shipping and instructions. This machine is supposed to come with different cleaners and polishing cloth. However, they are not shipped together and I had to call back to get the cleaners. The machine is worthless with out them. It took nearly 3 weeks to get all materials necessary to use this product. Additionally, the instructions are vague and don't give good direction on how to clean all types of jewelery. <end>  A fabulous product at a great price!  I have been shopping around for a nice ultrasonic jewelry cleaner as Iam a jewelry addict. This is by far the nicest machine for the price.I highly recommend this item....now my jewelry has it's original blingback! Thanks. <end>  Go for it!  I was also searching for the 'jewlers cleaning sparkle'. This product is worth the money becaause it cleans better than anything else I have tried. I hadn't had my ring professionaly cleaned since I had it resized 2-3 years ago.I added some home cleaner (like Fantastic) to the cleaning solution after not being too impressed with the first 2 cycles. It took about 5 cleaning cycles but my ring looks fantastic. <end>  Doesn't clean as well as it should  I ordered my jewelry cleaner directly from Shaper Image. The unit arrived a few days later, but they didn't ship the cleaning solution with it and it took another week for that to arrive. When I finally got everything I was so excited to use the cleaner expecting to get the orginial shine my engagement ring had when my husband gave it to me. I was disappointed. After 2 cleanings (one on normal mode and one on high) the cleaner got the platinum band shiny again and the top of the diamond. However my particular ring has a unique setting that is like a U shape that the diamond sits in. When you hold the ring up at eye level you can actually see the bottom of the diamond. The cleaner did not clean the area under the diamond at all. I can easily get into this area under the diamond with a small brush, it is an open space so I thought the solution wouldn't have any issues reaching this area. I was able to clean my ring better with the cheap ammonia based solution that you buy at a drugstore. This machine was a total waste of money for me.UPDATED  I have to admit I was too quick to judge this product. Apparently my ring was just extremely dirty, because it took about 6 cycles to get it completely clean. Now it does shine and sparkle again, and by keeping it maintained every 2 weeks it now stays that way. I do recommend this product, it just may take some patience in the beginning. <end>
 B000AMVX3Q  14K White Gold 1/2 ct. Round and Baguette Cut Diamond Anniversary Ring (Higher Quality) ||	  Poor quality  The ring they sent me was similar, but still very different than the ring in this picture. Also, the diamonds were very yellow... I'd even say that some of them were BROWNISH. I've never actually seen such yellow diamonds. Every single baguette had large visible flaws. I would rather wear a $5 CZ ring (or no ring at all) than wear this one. <end>
 B000AMW7AO  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Lucky Horseshoe Ring ||	  Lovely Ring  My friend had wanted a horseshoe ring for a very long time. I came across this one, with it's wonderful price I couldn't pass it up. When it arrived at my house I realized it was much more beatiful in person, this picture doesn't do it justice. <end>
 B000AMZ6A2  Feuille - Stunning Two Tone Comfort Fit Wedding Band for Him & Her! Custom Made! Choose your Size. ||	  Beautiful Ring  My fiance' loves it. It's even nicer then the picture. The center gold part of the ring is raised a little higher then the white gold part which is hard to tell from the picture but that just adds to the originality of it. The shipping is a little high but the quality is great! <end>  More beautiful than the picture looks!  We ordered two rings on a Monday and received them on Thursday! What great service. The rings are exact size, so I am glad we had our sizing done twice. They are really beautiful and believe even better than the picture reflects! <end>  Awesome!  We love our rings, they look even better than in the picture. This company was so easy to deal with and were very accomidating when it came to customizing our rings and their pricing made this purchace even easier.. WE searched for two months and finally found these and we are so happy! We can't wait to put them on perminately next month!Thank you so much!!!Danny and Renee McCoy <end>  Thanks  Great rings, my husband and I love them. They looked absolutely beautiful when they arrived, they still look beautiful now (three month later, and we never take them off), they feel nice and comfortable to wear. Thank you. <end>  A Gorgeous Wedding Band  I am totally pleased w/ the ring I received and would not hesitate to order from this company again. The quality was excellent. I was afraid it might not arrive in time for Christmas as it was coming from Canada and wasn't shipped until a week before, but it was sent Fedex overnight. <end>
 B000AMZR60  Sterling Silver Starfish Necklace ||	  A Beautiful Gift  I purchased this necklace with the 18 inch chain, as a gift and was very happy with the quality of the piece. I was slightly disappointed with the size as I thought it was going to be about a 1/2 inch larger in diameter, but it is still a lovely necklace and I was not at all reluctant to give it as the gift for which it was purchased. <end>  STAR  This was given as a gift to my girlfriend. She hasn't had a vacation in over 10yrs..has been to the beach in 20? i think...this was just a little teaser gift for her to look forward to the trip <end>
 B000AN12YK  Sterling Silver Diamond Cubic Zirconia Star Pendant ||	  Very nice  The pendant was very sparkly and nice. Always happy with purchases from Eve's Addiction <end>
 B000AN5EQW  Red String Kabbalah Bracelet ||	  Why is Rachel weeping?  Rachel is weeping because people are selling Red Strings that have not been wrapped around Rachel's Tomb. Rachel's Tomb-- you know?--in Israel. Provide more information if it does indeed come from Israel. <end>  KABBALAH  THE SHIPPING WAS MORE THAN THE BRACELET. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AND IT WAS CHEAP AND IT BROKE. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SITE. <end>  Lighten up  I like the bracelet, and wear it for my own reasons.To me, a cord bracelet symbolizes a connection of us to our sources.The actual bracelet is prettier than the one pictured. It was just what I was looking for. <end>  Protection from the Tomb of Rachel OR Idol worship????  Are 100% of the sales profits of these red strings being given to the Jewish charities or B'nai Brith for humanitarian work? Or are the producers profiting it all? False prophets seem to profit from the sacred.God is NOT for sale. If you want God's protection - pray and study his holy books - whether it be from any of the world's major religions. Just as Jesus went beserk for commercialism in the synagouge ... this radical Kabbalah sect stops at nothing to sell God to the spiritually lazy. Moses freaked out too when the ancient Israelites created the Golden Calf. The Kabbalah movement of Rabbi Berg is a renegade sect. Mainstream Jewish leaders do not allow people to study Kabbalah until they are versed and well rooted in The Torah and over 40 years of age. Most Hollywood stars fail this criterion totally. Nonetheless, Rachel, a beloved matriach of the Old Testament and Torah .... has been reduced to $22? If this doesn't sound like idoltry to you well ... ok then. Consider too that Kabbalah holy water is sold at $4 for a bottle. Hint to those "too poor to buy God's blessings and protection" ... if you go into any Roman Catholic Church with an empty bottle .... a Priest will happily allow you to fill your canter from a large cooler near the pews. Price? It's free - for God is priceless. The water from Lourdes, a scared Catholic site in France is also FREE, one only needs to pay for the shipping of the water to their home.Rachel's TombRachel's Tomb is a holy site of high significance to Judaism and is located in Northern Judea (Southern West Bank) just outside of the Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo at the northern entrance to Bethlehem along what was once the Biblical Bethlehem-Ephrath road. The town of Bethlehem had expanded north in recent years to enclose the surrounding area.Tradition holds that it is the burial place of the Biblical Matriarch Rachel, the wife of Jacob, who died here giving birth to Benjamin. It is considered the third holiest site in Judaism after the Temple Mount and the Cave of the Machpelah (Genesis Rabbah 79 7). Over the years, Rachel's Tomb has been a place of pilgrimage for Jews, especially Jewish women unable to give birth. Jewish tradition teaches that Rachel weeps for her children and that when the Jews were taken into exile, she wept as they passed by her grave on the way to Babylonia.The actual "tomb" consists of a rock with eleven stones upon it, one for each of the eleven sons of Jacob who were alive when Rachel died in childbirth. Over the centuries, the rock was covered by a dome supported by four arches. (In the Middle East, domes were used for structural support in small buildings until modern times due to a lack of wood beams for roofs.)The dome structure was eventually enclosed by Sir Moses Montefiore, who added a second room. In the 1990's, due to the deteriorating security situation, the original domed structure was fortified and enclosed inside a building with a hall from the entrance.During the Jordanian period, 1948-1967, Jews were forbidden to visit the Tomb. Recently, the site has been surrounded by a barrier to separate it from Bethlehem. Access is now restricted to pilgrims and tourists approaching from Israel. Rachel's Tomb has been known in Arabic as Qubbat Rakhil ("the Dome of Rachel"), although now some Palestinian sources claim that the Montefiore enclosure is in fact the mosque of Bilal Bin Rabbah.Some sources claim that actual Rachel's Tomb is in Northern Jerusalem at a site called by local Arabs "the place of the sons of Israel" which is near present day A-Ram, the site of Biblical Ramah. The place is mentioned in the "Prophets" section of the Hebrew Bible as the site of Rachel's burial when King Saul visits the site, in I Samuel 10 2. Later Jewish sources take the site near Bethlehem as the real site. For this view of the burial site, see[1] and[2]. <end>  This is sad!!  This is sad "the Hottest thing around everyone is wearing it"!!! What!!!!It's truly sad, I wear my own one from a regular string. I have a mix of religions I choose from teaching and etc. But this again is very sad the people that wear it for "fashion" or trend probaly don't even know the point of it. Today people are changing there religions left and right to "fit in" this is truly sad. I would rate this 0 stars!! <end>
 B000AN5F8Y  14K Gold & Sterling Star of David Necklace ||	  Great!  Great looking star of David necklace. I just love it, it is exactly as it pictured. I've been looking for a long time the star of David necklace and when I noticed this one, I knew it is the one and that I will love it. Thumbs up! <end>
 B000AN7KF0  Bracelet Buddy ||	  A great help  My hands are numb and stiff do to multiple sclerosis. This product enables me to wear bracelets again. <end>  Truly my buddy  There were days when it would take me over 10 minutes to put a bracelet on because one side would keep sliding off my wrist as I tried to snap it on so this really helps. <end>  An absolute must ...  An absolute must for anyone without 3 hands! I never got the knack of doing bracelet clasps for myself; my bracelets languished in the jewelry box until I bought my Bracelet Buddy! <end>  Bracelet Buddy  Item received quickly and in excellent shape. Fairly simple to use and compact to carry. <end>
 B000ANFUSY  Oval Shield Silver Natural Seed Pearl Ring - Dahlia Vintage Collection ||	  Marcasite Ring  I purchased this ring for my Mother's 83rd birthday. She loves marcasite jewelry and the ring looked beautiful online. My order was received, processed and forwarded to me very promptly and accurately. The ring was absolutely gorgeous; much more than the picture online. My Mother was so excited, it fit perfectly. I am extremely pleased with the service and product. I will definitely purchase from this vendor again. <end>
 B000ANFUZC  Gemini Silver Natural Seed Pearl Ring, Ruby - Dahlia Vintage Collection ||	  Faulty Pearls  I bought this ring for my girlfriend about 3 months before I gave it to her (I wanted to snatch it up before it went out of stock again). Literally one month into wearing it and the pearls just kept falling out one by one. The ring didn't come into contact with any abrasive chemicals or soaps nor did she accidentally bang the ring on anything or drop it. After one month of use, the pearls just fell out. I contacted Dahlia and they did not contact me back. The ring has a 90 day exchange warranty. For the price, the warranty needs to be a lot longer. I will not buy from Dahlia again due to their shoddy jewelry and their even shoddier (lack of) customer service. <end>  Even Prettier in Person  I ordered this ring with the goal of any thing with rubies and pearls. I was very pleased with it when it arrived. The stones shine brilliantly, and the setting is stable and secure. It is a very pretty ring, and stands out against other popular jewelry today. <end>  I absolutely love this ring!  I have had this ring for 5 months now and have had no issues with it at all. I love the way it looks and I get so many compliments on it. I even want have an engagement ring fashioned in the same vintage style. Currently, it is my favorite ring and I wear everyday. <end>  Beautiful ring  The ring arrived as a Christmas gift. I tried it on to be sure it fit then had to put it away for under the tree. It is lovely and I can't wait to wear it. The matching earrings came later as I wanted to be sure I liked the ring before I ordered then. My husband was pleased to have these to give me. Service was great. I plan to use them while playing Mary Todd Lincoln in re enacting. <end>  Old-fashioned Charm  This ring is lovely and unique. The tiny pearls form miniature blooms with rubies at their heart. The stones are all well-set as this is a well-made ring. The rubies are a pretty deep rose color, adding to the charm. I recommend this ring for someone who appreciates dainty and different jewelry. <end>  Fabulous pearls!  I saw this ring online and thought it was a great ring but now that I can wear it I think it is fabulous and absolutely adore it. <end>  Gorgeous ring  It's very pretty and unique. The rubies are a little lighter in color than I expected...they are more like pink. But the ring is very nice nonetheless. <end>
 B000AO3350  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver Butterfly Toe Ring ||	  For children maybe.........  If you are buying for children I would recommend it but it is ENTIRELY to small for adults. I won't order this type of product again without finding out the size. <end>
 B000AO971Y  Love Symbols Sterling Silver Toe Ring ||	  Solid  This toe ring is nice. I've had two other toerings (different designs) before that broke, but this one is solid. It's flexible enough so you can resize, but it's solid enough that it won't split. I really like it. <end>
 B000AOADQM  ELEGANT LOOKS REAL 5 CZS BRIDAL RING ||	  Perfect Ring!!  I love this ring. Its exactly like my $1,000 engagement ring that I lost. I wear it all the time and it keeps its shimmer and shine. A very believable ring. Not too big. <end>
 B000AOGG40  ELEGANT RED DAISY CZ RIGHT HAND RING ||	  Almost perfect  I absolutely love this ring. I love anything with flowers on it and this is so beautiful. The only thing that bothers me is that the peridot stones in this ring are yellow. They should be green! Flowers only have yellow leaves if they're dying. <end>
 B000AOVARS  Silver Tone Oval Rolo Link Charm Bracelet and Fairy with Blue Crystal Wings ||	  Think stainless steel.  I bought this fairy bracelet because my niece loves Tinkerbell. I loved the fact that the fairy has a kind of stone on the wings. So I bought one of each, a fairy with red wings, green, blue, well you get the idea. I regret buying them because the actual bracelet feels and looks like stainless steel instead of having a silver look. It reminds me of something that you can buy at a hardware store. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Bottom line- cute concept but poorly made. <end>  UNHAPPY  I bought this for my sister-in -law because she loves fairies. When I got it I thought for the price that it was really cute. She had it on for 10 minutes and the fairy broke off of the bracelet. It was very poorly made and I was very unhappy with it. <end>
 B000AQE8SY  Cubic Zirconia CZ Scroll Toe Ring - JewelryWeb ||	  looks pretty BUT..................  Looks GREAT, but it is not wearable. It snags on everything, it does not stay in place on my toe. The band part is thin, already looks ready to break off - it is just a piece of metal open ended-not a full complete ring. I know it says 14K and that is soft metal,and since the band is so thin, it is already out of shape/bent/and after two (2) tries, I am unable to wear it. So much for my birthday present! I got this from my husband because I am handicapped/unable to wear closed toe shoes. I wanted a pretty toe ring to replace the rings I wore until they cut them off my foot prior to my last surgery. In order to put this ring on/wear, you have to pull the band away from the front of the ring then squeeze it your toe into it- then squeeze the band again to tighten it on your toe. The cubic zirconia's (all 3 of them) snag the rug, snag everything-settings are flimsy. I wanted a toe ring to wear 24/7 that looks pretty. I got the pretty part but can not wear it - period. To wear this on occasion, I believe the band would quickly break off with more that 5 times of putting it on and taking it off. I did not know until I got it that it was an open band design that you self adjust to your toe/squeeze it to fit. <end>
 B000AQECJE  Earspiral Earrings 53SMN 53 short multicolor Niobium ||	  playful  I bought these earrings for my twelve-year old daughter, who does not support silver too well. No problem though with these earrings. The design is playful, just as my daughter is. They curve beautifully along the neck, and are lightweight. Putting them in is an easy trick to learn, and once they are in, they remain in place. What a great choice! <end>
 B000AQECKS  Earcuff 9TRGF 14K Gold-filled ||	  Nice Addition  I ordered this ear cuff for a gold piece of jewelry to match my other jewelry. I knew it was closer to elegant than fun, but it really is a beautiful cuff. Depending on how you wear your hair, it can act as a subtle flash of color or a noticeable and shining conversation starter.For me, this cuff is exceptionally easy to put on and has never fallen off. It's the cuff I wear most frequently now. <end>  Earcuff 9TRGF 14K Goldfilled  I always had a love of earcuffs, because I have a fear of adding holes to me ears. With earcuffs, I can look modern.... <end>  nice buy easy to lose  I loved it but have already lost it! I was so angry at myself, eventually I will have to replace it. It looked really nice. <end>  very satisified  I bought the eay cuff for my daughter. She love it, that was most important to me. With a cuff she did not have her cartledge pierced <end>  Happy  Item as described. Very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend this to other buyers. Shipped very fast. Nice earcuff. <end>  Beautiful Cuff  I am very pleased with my purchase. It was delivered in a timely manner and I love it. I'm glad I didn't let the price deter me. It's a beautiful accessory. <end>  Great Size and Quality  The size is perfect and just flexible enough.Made well and presents nicely.Occasionally hurts my ears so I am still adjusting. <end>
 B000AQK5EU  Earspiral Earrings 353 with dangling Cubic Zirconia, 14K Gold-filled ||	  My Favorite Designer  I have been a fan of Harry Mason for almost 10 years now. I find his earrings unique and absolutely Gorgeous!! <end>
 B000AQKMCU  Elegant Five Strand Pearl Bracelet with CZ Clasp ||	  Very elegant  The pearls are smaller than they appear on the photo but this is a gorgeous bracelet. The closing is secure and it lays on my wrist perfectly.A little bit expensive for the quality but very elegant and I cant wait to wear it on my wedding day. <end>  I love my pearls!  I bought this for myself for Christmas. It is gorgeous! I LOVE it, the clasp is beautiful! I would definitely purchase again! <end>
 B000AQL2NS  Small Genuine Natural Round Green Peridot Sterling Silver Post Stud Earrings ||	  Really nice!  I got these for Christmas with a bracelet from Silver Insanity and they're both beautiful. The stones are large and the workmanship is top notch. <end>  quality peridot  These were the size that she wanted (she has several piercings on each ear/would have preferred the 3mm size but she made do! Nice color and clarity. <end>  Great Product!  This product is great! We bought a peridot necklace to go with the earrings for my daughters birthday and they matched perfectly. They arrived on time and in perfect condition. <end>
 B000AQUI6K  Charm Clip - P30 - Enamel Flower ~ Pink & Blue ||	  What more can I say?  This seller will never let you down. I have all you charms and need more! I wear them on my tennis shoe laces and the children at the hospital love them! You can not go wrong with this seller! <end>
 B000AS6790  14K Yellow Gold 2.0MM DIAMOND CUT SOLID ROPE 22" NECKLACE ||	  Beautiful Gold  I recently purchased this necklace and I am very pleased. I got many compliments. My own mother asked to wear it for a wedding shower and she got compliments on it too. It shines best in natural sun light. You'll feel good wearing this and never grow bored of it. I anticipate putting it on before I leave the house. Part of why it shines so well is because of how clean the cuts on the little circles are (not sure what the correct term or word is). Augustina is an incredibly great company, and although they are big into pearls the necklaces are for both men and women. Buy this item for yourself or give it to someone as a gift(just imagine the expression on their face when you hand it over to them). Just make sure you know the thickness and length you want. <end>
 B000ASJ6RK  Southwestern Style Animal Track ( Raccoon, Moose, Mountain Lion, Coyote, Beaver, Gray Wolf and Bear ) Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 11, #11873 ||	  beautiful  This ring is just exactly as it's pictured, and simply gorgeous -- and Taos Trading's customer service  fantastic. Highly recommended. . . . <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I love this ring... I love wildlife especially wolves and to have their tracks in turquoise on a beautiful sterling silver ring is awesome. You can't go wrong with this one! <end>
 B000ASYPTE  Childs or Kids Pink Ballet Shoes Charm Stretch Bracelet ||	  Very cute  I was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old, but I got this for my daughter's birthday and it fits her perfectly. I was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things I've bought from Amazon lately, but it's actually a very cute, well-made, cheap bracelet. <end>  Darling charm bracelet  My granddaughter loves this bracelet - I sent it as a surprise and she wore it to school the next day. <end>  Kids ballet bracelet...  Made a little girl very happy. Order processed, shipped and delivered in a timely manner. Just as expected. <end>
 B000AT0JLG  Childs or Kids Colorful Heart and Cross Cham Beaded Stretch Bracelet Set ||	  Good pick =)  Cute for a smaller child just learning how to take care of nice things. Kids seem to love them. Small size though a larger child could not fit easly even though they strech. All in all a good deal and one happy child to show for it =) <end>
 B000AT2JHI  Silver Tone Horse or Pony Charm Link Stretch Bracelet ||	  Great little bracelet!! Watch the Horses though.  This bracelet was purchased for my 7 year old. She really likes it. It has strong cording so that it will not break easily. The one problem that I do find with it is that the horse charms will fall off easily though. I know this is an issue with the charm bracelet itself, however I have found a couple possible solutions. Either soder it your self OR buy the really good metal glue. It works really well.Great bracelet, very cute..two different types of horses. Would actually rate it ..4 1/2 stars. <end>  ADORABLE BRACELET!  This is a gift for my niece she loves horses! I think she will love it! This bracelet is adorable! <end>  Great Product!  What a wondeful bracelet! I bought it for my 12 daughter, who loves horses! I was not disappointed with it!It is very strong and well made. The order was very quick and efficient! We had it in less than a WEEK.Love it. <end>  CHARMS  BEAUTIFUL BRACELET WASN'T VERY STURDY. IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY 6YR OLD WHO DESTROYED IT IN 2WKS. CHARMS KEPT FALLING OFF. <end>  Had to repair  When this bracelet arrived, one of the horse charms was not attached to the bracelet. Before giving this as a gift, I had to re-attach it to the bracelet. That was a little annoying. <end>  Good Buy  This was bought as a present for a little girl that likes horses. It seemed quite well made and was a big hit. <end>  No problems at all  This horse bracelet was a gift for my granddaughter a couple of years ago and she cherishes it. A 5 or 6 yr old is too young to appreciate it, and chances are they would not take good care of it. As far as I know there has been no problems at all with the horses falling off or I think she would have told me. Its a beautiful bracelet for girls that love horses and are old enough to take care of a piece of jewelry. <end>
 B000AUMHWE  Tiny Frog or Toad Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver, #11514 ||	  Darlin' Frogs  These are tiny, adorable, solid (not even a little bit "tinny"), well-detailed earrings. Sometimes less (size-wise) is just enough and that's why I wanted these bits of silliness for my ears. They will not shout out that you are wearing frogs on your ears; they will bring a gentle smile to someone who comes close enough to notice. I figure if someone is that close, he/she knows me well enough to expect to find tiny frogs on my earlobes. These are great fun jewelry and, as always, Taos Trading delivered in record time. I love this company! <end>
 B000AUXVNS  Diamond nose bone in 14 karat NICKEL FREE white gold ||	  Couldn't Be Happier!  I have worn this nose bone for over 2 years and I love it. Have tried other metals but can only wear gold so this is perfect for me. Lays flat on the nose and, because of the 18 ga ball on the end, no worries about losing it. Diamond really sparkles and I have had many compliments on it. If you have to wear gold like I do, this nose bone is for you! <end>  Perfect!  I love this nose ring! I've had my nose pierced for nearly 10 years, and this stud is the cutest and sturdiest one I've had. I have worn it consistently for many months now, and I regularly get compliments on it. <end>  Very pretty - but also very small for the price!  First of all, when I opened the package for this nose bone I was kind of shocked at how tiny it is! I have been wearing a surgical-grade stainless steel nose screw and this is MUCH more comfortable. It is cute, well made and I like it. It does not snag because of the smooth bezel setting. The teeny diamond does sparkle. The only downside is the price which is really expensive for such a tiny piece of jewelry. In addition, the seller charges about $6 shipping and the actual shipping as marked on the envelope was about $2. If the price was about half of what it is and the seller did not inflate shipping by 300% I would feel better about this purchase. However, with all that said, I am happy with this item - just wish it had been priced more reasonably. <end>  Not bad but...  I got this nose bone and as far as what it looked like, it did look like the picture. I did feel that the diamond was hard to see, less noticeable than in the picture. Still, I was fairly pleased. When I put it in, one problem became apparent. The part of the nose bone holding the diamond was no centered on the post. I don't know if this was intentional, but it did make the nose bone sit funny in my nose. Still, I used it and wasn't unpleased. My piercing was fairly new, though, and the gauge was smaller than my piercing, so I ended up losing it after a few days.Overall, I feel the quality is there but the setting takes away from the appearance of the diamond. It is a decent piece of jewelry, but tiny for the cost. <end>  very disappointed  I couldnt wait to get the nose bone. But it kept falling out! I would awake and find it on the pillow next to me. also it wasn't long enuf. I lost it inside of two weeks. I bought a cheap silver set of them for 12.00. They went all the way through and I havent had any trouble with losing them. I will not buy a nose bone from Amazon again and it's a shame because I always get stuff from Amazon! I am SO sorry I spent $60.00 on it <end>
 B000AV0K6I  Sterling Silver Ear Threader Needleback Chain Earrings with Green Crystal Drops ||	  They don't stay in your ears!!  These earrings are very pretty, and they thread through your ear just fine, but they have one majory design flaw... there is nothing to keep the thread from continuing to slip through your ear, until it falls right on out!The weight of the crystal pulls the thread down, and gravity does the rest. I tried all different ways of attempting to get these things to stay put... even tried to tie a knot behind my ear as an improvised backing. You can imagine how well that worked!Very disappointed. <end>
 B000AV62WO  Fun Multicolor Gambling Dice Charm Stretch Bracelet ||	  Fun Multicolor Gambling Dice Charm Stretch Bracelet  I bought this quite some time ago and my daughter still loves it. I wear it once in a while too <end>
 B000AV8ZOC  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Sun Cross Dangle Earrings ||	  Pretty Earings  These were a bit smaller than I expected, but were beautiful none the less. One fell out though, luckily I found it. I would recomend wearing backs with these just to be on the safe side. <end>
 B000AWI370  Dangle Earrings with Shiny Pink beads ||	  elegant! and pocket friendly!  I love my earrings, they look elegant and light so they dont weigh u down if ur wearing them the whole day thru.. <end>  Pink Earrings  These look a little more clunkier than expected and the pink glass looks more like plastic. <end>  Beautiful and Comfortable, one of myy favorite pair of earrings  I really like them. They look elegent on me. One of the most favorite parts besides the looks, that I "especially" like is that they are the french loop kind that are easy and fast to put on and that they are heavy enough that they stay in place. This reduces the risk of losing them. But they are also light enough that I don"t feel bogged down with them on my ears. <end>
 B000AXSH2A  CUBIC ZIRCONIA BANDS - 14k gold plated easy to match CZ wedding band ||	  VERY NICE  THIS RING IS VERY NICE FOR THE PRICE. I RETURNED IT ONLY BECAUSE I WAS CHOOSING BETWEEN THIS ONE AND ANOTHER I HAD NO INTENTIONS OF KEEPING BOTH RINGS. BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT WANTED A REALISTIC PIECE. NOT SURE HOW IT IS IF YOU WASH YOUR HANDS BUT HEY COME ON IF YOU WANT ALL THAT THEN ORDER REAL GOLD. <end>
 B000AXSH98  Cubic Zirconia Bands - Sterling Silver Baguette and Round CZ Wedding Band - Size 6 ||	  Loves it!!  This nice little ring looks great along or stacked with others. It shines up nice with just warm water and soap! Wish they had more in stock! <end>  after 18months  I bought this ring 18months ago. Wearing it all day, looks styl same! Metal is in perfect condition and stones also.Stylish and looks expensive. <end>
 B000AXTNJQ  14k Yellow Gold Pear-Cut Swiss Blue Topaz Bracelet ||	  B-day present  A beautiful piece of jewelry, it will make my daughter very happy on her birthday this Dec. I bought this so early because at this price, it was a steal! I have not come across another bracelet half as nice for the money!I am very pleased and would recommend this product to anyone.M.Hamlyn <end>  blue topaz bracelet  This will be one of the gifts for my grandniece on graduation. She will have the necklace and ring to go with it. As it is her birthstone, and she doesn't have any blue topaz jewelry yet, this will be perfect. <end>  Yellow gold Pear-Cut topaz bracelet  I love wearing it, I have matching earrings and pendant, I've received many compliments on the bracelet. I have a small wrist and it is a perfect fit! <end>
 B000AXYN3C  White Gold 20in & 1mm Perfectina Chain Necklace ||	  White Gold Chain  The chain was purchased to wear with a white gold and diamond cross. The chain compliments the cross better than I could have imagined. The chain is just a brilliant as the diamond cross. <end>
 B000AZ0XAW  14K White Gold Trinity Charm ||	  Trinity Pendant  On time delivery, this item is exactly what I wanted and its a nicepiece of jewelry. It looks so good I bought one for my wife.This product at 14k gold was made pretty sturdy and good looking.I get positive comments all of the time about it. <end>
 B000AZ4CZY  Sterling Silver Etoile Huggy Earrings ||	  Company recompense  I bought these in vermeil and silver. Neither closed correctly. I destroyed one pair trying to adjust a catch, but the other I sent back. I gave a dim view not because the company or it's services are bad; but because the product, while cute, was inferior.Company has more than made it up to me and I DO like Eve's Addiction products. I will buy from them again. Thanks everyone. <end>
 B000B0Y3NY  3mm Wide Hammered Finish Sterling Silver 17" V Collar Choker Neckwire Necklace ||	  Love it!  The shape is flattering to the neckline and unlike other collars I own, it lays flat around the neck and required no adjustment. Although light in weight, it is not flimsy and stays in place. The V-shape, 17" length and and 3mm size is perfect for pendants with smaller bails. <end>  Most beautiful piece of jewelry I own!  I love it so much! The hammered detail is simply marvelous, it is easy to put on and stays put, perfectly curved to stay close to my neck and upper chest. It is just what I expected and more, it even looks amazing with a pendent -especially a round one!Don't hesitate to get this trust me it's worth it!Oh, and it came within days, before the week was over it was in the mailbox; Arriving at least 3 days before I was expecting it to! <end>  OK  This v collar choker is pretty but it doesn't hang like I would like it to. I will not return it. May give it as a gift. Nothing wrong with it....maybe just my neck??? <end>  Love it  Just received this on Monday. It is really nice. I like how it fits and the quality is very good. I've gotten many complements on how nice it looks. <end>
 B000B0ZNW4  Sterling Silver Large Oval Genuine Amber Ring Size 8 ||	  Beautiful  This ring was a gift for my daughter and it was an instant winner!!! It is large and so lovely with inclusions that make it interesting. I would buy another if it were available. <end>
 B000B12TU2  Sterling Silver Black Onyx CELTIC CLADDAGH Ring size 6.5 ||	  Quality ring - Excellent Vendor -  Even getting super glue on it did NOT affect the silver or onyx inset - Managed to glue 3 fingers together 2 yrs ago - Much to local EMS amusement. <end>
 B000B12U0Q  Sterling Silver Rainbow Moonstone Poison Box Locket Ring Size 7.5 ||	  Nicer looking in person.  Prettier in person! This ring was shinier and more expensive looking than the photo featured. It's also delicate looking, with the box/hinge I expected it to be maybe a bit bulky and awkward, but not so. My daughter loves it. Great service from Silver Insanity as well regarding shipping speed/packaging etc. <end>  Sterling Silver Rainbow Moonstone Poison Box Locket Ring  I got this ring for my niece and one also for her mom, my sister. They love it. Now my other sister wants one. I finally bought one of the others for myself. <end>  not as pictured  the ring doesn't look like the same ring from the picture. the black detail in non existent, and the stone is very dull, and has none of the blue hue shown in the picture, mine looks just like glass. i was so excited when i ordered it, but extremely disappointed when it arrived. <end>  Moonstone Ring  It's a little weak and smaller than I thought, but I still like it, and it came quickly. <end>
 B000B1TIAQ  Diabetic Medical Id Jewelry Necklace ||	  necklace too short  The necklace broke the first time my husband took it off. It's entirely too short. I am doubly disappointed because when it arrived the first time, the &#34;diabetic&#34; inscription was missing; I returned it, and the item, as it was advertised, did make it back before Christmas. <end>  It is great for the money!  It is a sturdy piece. It is an ID necklace, not a fine piece of jewelryServes it's purpose well.. <end>  Great Product  Great Product and purchased it as a fob for a work pouch to alert anyone I worked with that I am Diabetic. <end>  Medical ID Necklace for Men  The Medical ID Necklace for men is a very good, high quality identifyer for a diabetic to wear. I got mine in in about 5 days after placing the order, and wear it every day. You will be happy if you need and order one. <end>  stamped not clear  the id necklace chain has no clasp and it barely fit over my head if someone had a bigger head it would not fit at all also the diabetes stamp u cannot make it out <end>  Diabetic medic alert necklace  It is necessary for all diabetics to own and wear one, for when they are unable to communicate with the ems/emt, the necklace speaks for them. <end>  Great Product  Been wearin this for a while now and It has become a part of me I guess. Like my ring I know when it's not on me. <end>  It's fair  Ordered the tag and started wearing in May. The red paint from the medical symble is all gone from the front of the neckless. Other than that, its fine. <end>  Diabetic necklace  I purchased this item for my daughter, age 19. She was recently diagnosed as a diabetic. The only complaint she has with this necklace is there is no opening, you have to put it over your head. Thank goodness she can fit it over her head. She was kind of disappointed with it because of that. <end>  Must have  My doctor was on me for a pretty long time to get an id tag but I really didn't want one. I finally realized it is something very important to have on, especially if you work away from people who know you are diabetic. After wearing it a while you forget you even have it on. It is very discrete and lightweight. <end>  Cheap & Nearly Unreadable  This bracelet, although relatively inexpensive, is too cheaply made. The links from bracelet to chain are cheap and can be pulled off. The emblem comes off (as mine did) as it is just glued on. The word DIABETIC lightly engraved on the back is barely readable and in less than good lighting conditions may not be able to be read at all. Not recommended at any price. <end>  Nice item, but too small  Nice quality item, particularly for the price. Only problem is there is no clasp and my husband couldn't get it over his head. So measure to see if it will work for you. <end>  Diabetic Necklace  I am diabetic and just in case I am unconscious, I would like it known that I am diabetic. Highly recommended to any diabetic people. <end>  Diabetic Necklace from a gum ball machine  Folks come on my Grandmother always told me you get what you pay for, what did you expect for under five dollars. I too ordered one, not the greatest, but I expected that because of what I paid for it, I am not going to be shocked or surprised when the emblem breaks, or you can't read what it says on the back. I did not buy it to impress anyone. I just want the authorities to know that I am a diabetic, if I can't tell them myself. My main gripe with this company, is that the item was backordered, and no one told me, so after about three weeks or so after the due date I became concerned (NOT TOO CONCERNED ONLY 5 BUCKS), but none the less they told me "OH YEAH THAT HAS BEEN OUT OF STOCK ON BACK ORDER WE SHOULD BE GETTING THEM IN SHORTLY" It would have been nice to know this before I became worried.....Bottom line you get what you pay for.............. <end>  After a few weeks, the chain broke  The medalion is pretty basic and standard, but they didn't put a clasp in the chain, and after a few weeks the chain broke. <end>  lifesaver  I recently purchased the diabetic necklace for my ten year old son. He had tried wearing a bracelet but it kept breaking. The necklace is perfect since he loves wearing it. Thank you for the quick delivery. <end>  Decent, but no word 'diabetic' carved on back as shown  The pic shows this as having the word "DIABETIC" engraved on the back of this item... it arrived with this not present. No problem for me, as I will dremel it in myself, but this is not what is shown on this item sale page, and is not what I ordered. <end>  Diabetic ID Necklace  This is a very functional, inexpensive necklace and is comfortable to wear. I am happy with this, both the product and the price. <end>  Great Price for Medical ID  I've been looking for a Diabetic specific ID bracelet for a good price. This satisfied me in quality and price. <end>  Diabetes medic alert necklace  I could not find an inexpensive dibetes medic alert necklace at any of the local pharmacys. They only offered expensive custom orders that would take weeks to get. This was just what I was lookingh for and it was quick and inexpensive. <end>  works  This is the extra one that we needed in case he breaks the other one we bought and it stays in his work truck at all times <end>  great size  took it off the chain and put it on a charm bracelet - my cousin loved it -- older lady and she was self conscious about telling the world about her &#34;personal business&#34; looks like a nice piece of jewelry - good shine and size. <end>  Newly placed on insulin  This was a great price for the tag. The chain was a bit on the chintzy side, so I ended up using an older chain that I had on hand. <end>
 B000B43QI8  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Knotwork Necklace with a Bright Green 7x10mm Peridot ||	  outstanding!  I received this off my wish list from a dear friend and I must say, it's stunning. It's both delicate and sturdy. The craftsman's shift is beautiful, in what you would expect a piece to cost four times this amount. The stone is beautiful and large, without being gaudy.It's a stunning piece of work. All you lads out there, should buy this for you lass, and make her very happy!Wonderful piece I highly recommend for quality and price. <end>  Very Pretty Wedding Necklace.  I bought this necklace to go with my renaissance wedding outfit. It matched perfectly and was the look that I wanted. It is made well and has clean lines. The celtic design in the silver work is just what I was looking for. The stone color is clear and a nice shade of peridot green - just like in the picture. The only fault it has with me is that I thought it would be a little bigger (I didnt really pay attention to the listed measurement - my fault). Its about and inch and a half-ish wide. Overall I really love it and would recommend it as a good buy. <end>  Cool item  My recipient was very happy with this item. It looks very good on her. It is a smidge smaller than it appears in the photo, but that comes with the territory of buying things online. <end>  Beautiful  I bought this necklace about 1 year ago and it is stunning. I am still getting compliments every time I wear this. <end>  beautiful  This necklace pretty much looks like it does on line. The size is perfect for me as I don't like things that get too big. The peridot is beautiful and the quality of the necklace is actually much better than I expected. I am thrilled with this purchase! <end>  Beautiful Necklace!  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I actually make other jewelry and also collect gemstones. I haven't got into the metal work yet, so I ordered this necklace. I do however recognize a good gemstone when I see it - the Peridot in this necklace is beautiful!I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality. Thank you very much! <end>  Satisfactory purchase  I do not have much experience in purchasing jewelry. However, I found it to be smaller than I thought for the price you buy it for and the picture is a tad misleading. The gift wrapping was a joke as I put forth eight bucks and only received a decorated box. It is very pretty and I am sure my recipient will like it, regardless. Those are the only two problems I have with it. Shipping was very fast. <end>  Made me a hero  Beautiful piece at a great price, and delivered quickly. It was one of the highlights of the Christmas holiday for my wife. Thanks! <end>  Wife loves this  I bought this necklace and the matching earrings as a gift for my wife and she loves them. They look really nice and seem to be well made too. <end>  Great job!  Good product, looked just like the pictures, arrived quickly and in perfect shape. A great transaction! <end>  Misleading picture  I bought this with the peridot earrings from the same seller, so if you see a repetition of the points i make its because the seller is the same,firstly the picture makes it look a lot better than it is,its a very pale green, at more than [...] including shipping it looks more like a [...] piece of costume jewelry,i am really surprised some reviewers claim to have worn this as wedding jewelry,this mainly was what made me buy it, goes to show caveat emptor, its now to late to get anything else so i really can't return it,would not recommend it to anyone else <end>
 B000B534D4  14k White Gold Diamond Floral Earrings (1/2 cttw, I Color, I1 Clarity) ||	  Diamonds are Good Quality But the Earrings are a Bit Too Small to Notice  These earrings were a gift for my mother. Though the quality of the diamonds exceeded my expectations, the earrings themselves were on the small side so it was kind of hard to really notice the quality of the diamonds once she was wearing them. Be sure to use the Amazon size indicator to get an idea of the size of these earrings and how they will appear on the ear. If you don't mind the smallish size, you will be pleased by sparkle and quality of the stones. <end>
 B000B57RCS  Gemini Silver Natural Seed Pearl Earrings, Ruby - Dahlia Vintage Collection ||	  Tiny but nice  I bought these for my wife -- they're a little smaller than I expected, but fair enough given the pricing. Generally nice, and they came in a decent gift box. <end>
 B000B5GNY6  Crescent Moon Silver Natural Seed Pearl Hoop Earrings - Dahlia Vintage Collection ||	  Very delicate  These are very delicate earrings, unique craftsmanship. I receive a lot of compliments for them. <end>  earrings  The earrings are crescent moon, black with tiny pearls. They are dressy, very lovely, classy. Am enjoying wearing them. The description and picture shown on screen accurately described the earrings. <end>
 B000B5KOLY  Penicillin Medical Id Jewelry Necklace ||	  perfect!  i am very pleased with my whole shopping experience the item was just as described it was shipped very fast ...perfect <end>  No clasp.  Got the product timely and the quality is fine; my only complaint is that there is no clasp on the necklace. Just be aware when you purchase. <end>
 B000B5MFDY  Drops of Wisdom Cultured Pearl Sterling Silver Chain Necklace - Various Colors ||	  Beautiful!  This necklace is even more beautiful in person than the picture shows. It looks delicate, but is very well made, and the pearls have very clean surfaces with good luster. The color is beautiful, and the way the pearls hang from the chain is very graceful. I love it! <end>
 B000B5OA6E  Isabella Silver Rose Twin 9-10mm Cultured Pearl Drops Necklace - Various Colors ||	  Fell apart in less then 4 hours  Returned for refund. The first time worn it didn't last 4 hours before one of the stones fell off, then the clasp ring fell off. This is a real piece of junk! <end>
 B000B5QW24  Floral Oval Pewter Jewelry Box ||	  Great gift for jewelry lovers!  I ordered this as part of a Mother's Day gift after trying to think of something a little different to go into a gift package. It was a great success! It arrived 3 days after it was ordered, the packaging was lovely and the box itself is beautiful. It arrived just as it was described. Nice weight, perfect size for earrings and rings and jewelry worn every day, and is a nice decorative piece in and of itself. It's a perfect complement for a jewelry gift or just on its own! <end>  Love it  Love this little box; just what I had been looking for. Was even better when it went on sale. <end>
 B000B5XUNS  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Motion Spin Ring Size 9(Sizes 9,10,11,12,13) ||	  Somewhat less detailed than image  Received this item in a timely manner and it is stamped .925 sterling silver. The size was just right and the outer band smoothly spins around the fixed band. As in the image, the outer band is silver and the underlying band is a dark background bringing out the pattern, however, in the image, the outer band of knots appears to be raised, whereas the one I received is flat. Also, my ring looks much more like a series of figure 8's ,overlapping in places, rather than actual knots with the over-under as appears in the image. Where the design begins and ends there is an obvious seam.That said, I wanted this as something I could wear to Ren Faire and the crude design lends itself to that rather than something overly fancy. And at the price, I wasn't expecting too much so am ok with the item I received. <end>
 B000B5ZLT4  Sterling Silver Mystic Unicorn Horse Head Pendant with Genuine Marcasite ||	  Thankfully more of a HORSE than a UNICORN  My mom and I ordered this necklace (along with a 16 in. black silk cord "chain") for our 9-year-old granddaughter/niece for Christmas. I was hesistant to order it because 1) the name of the company was a little nuts "Insanity" and 2) we really were looking for horse-related pendants, not "mystical" unicorns for this little girl in our lives. What a pleasant surprise to discover that this beautifully-animated/decorated piece looks much MORE like a horse than a unicorn. It came in a little pouch. We purchased the mare/foal wooden keepsake box also and placed the necklace (as one of two) in it. The horse pendant is a great piece of art for any horse lover! <end>
 B000B6CSIK  SCER034 Sterling Silver Radiant Imitation Pearl and Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  My wife loves it!  It is good gift for girls. My wife is keep wearing this till now. Which means that it is not too bad! She is happy and I am happy too! <end>  Better than pictured  When I received these, months ago, I was so pleased at their appearance. The grey is rich and deep they look like you would have paid $100's for them. They are substantial but super light and comfortable. <end>  Pretty but not as pictured  These earring are very pretty and well worth the price but the pearls are more silver color rather than grey. Other than that no complain. <end>  Very pretty but color is off.  Like other reviewers have said the color is very light grey. Almost a dirty white. They are very pretty though. I read the other reviews so I knew they wouldn't be black when I bought them. I very happy with the quality for the price. <end>  My wife loved them  These simple, elegant, earrings don't overpower, but spice up a look. The light weight doesn't weigh down her ears. My wife loves them and wears them frequently! <end>  Nice but busy  These earrings are nicely made and sturdy for the price. However, just as stated in previous reviews I've read, the color of the pearls is very light. I also feel the earrings are a little too "busy" for lack of a better word; I would not have included the additional silver/beads on both the top and bottom of the pearl; overdone just a tad bit, but a nice pair of earrings nonetheless...especially for the price. <end>  Mom liked them  I bought these for my Mom for mother's day, They appear to be very well made for their price. However, I was slightly dissapointed to see that the grey in the ball was almost identical to the wire accents, I was also a little worried about their size because my mom is a thin woman, which was my own fault for not trying to find out what 10mm actually looked like. Luckily they ended up looking really nice on her.My mom has only worn studs before these, She had no issue with the clasp and said she received several compliments on them at work. Her only complaint was the weight of them bothered her ears after she had them in for a day or two, but I think that's from her being used to her small studs. <end>  Just what I hoped for  I was looking for just the right earrings for my daughter's black prom dress and these work just great. The dress is very elegent and the earrings work perfect with the dress with out clashing with the dress. My daughter loved them and the quality is lovely for the price. Everyone is very happy with these lovely earrings. <end>  Great quality  I just received these earrings and am truly amazed at the quality for the price. <end>  perfect  the earrings are georgous and will match the necklaces I made for my bridesmaids perfectly! <end>  Pretty, but not very dark  I ordered these earrings after buying, and loving, the white and pink pairs (SCER155 10mm White Genuine Swarovski Pearl And Swarovski Crystals Silver Leverback 1.5" Long Drop Earrings). I was looking for a dangle earring to go with my black pearls, but as another reviewer pointed out, these are actually a pale gray. The Amazon item picture is not that far off, but I uploaded a picture next to a pair of cultured black pearl studs and you can see the stark difference. Despite that, these are beautiful earrings! I wear them with black cz studs to match the crystals.These are nice quality for simulated pearls and I think they are worth the price. The leverbacks are very secure, so I don't worry about losing one as I do with french hooks. Overall, highly recommended and I think I'll be buying the blue pair next! <end>  Love these earrings!  I bought these for my birthday and was so pleased when I received them. They are so easy to attach - light weight and perfect for wearing with my long hair. I am purchasing another pair for a friend for her birthday as she raved about mine. <end>  Great price ~ lovely design  Love the design and colors of these. They are attractive and well made for a very reasonable cost.Would definitely purchase again from the seller. Fast, efficient service and correspondence was great! <end>  Pretty  I wear these often. They look great and the price is amazing for what you get. Comfortable and pretty. <end>  Pearl earings  What can I say! The quality of the Gem Avenue product is beyond my expectations. The first set of earings I ordered was made with anticipation; I was not sure what the earings would look like in person! The quality is first class, the workmanship is supurb and I have since ordered quite a few other earings from this company. The packaging is very nice and it comes by post very quickly after ordering. The photos on the internet don't do their product justice, it is much nicer in person. The lever back earings are secure and attractive. I was worried the earings would be heavy but they are not, they are light weight. I always look for whats new on Gem Avenue! <end>  Color is not like the picture  The color of these earrings is very light gray not as dark as picture. Very disappointed. <end>  They're the ones  This is another piece of beautiful jewelry that I just simply adore. I had been looking for some earrings in this color that would compliment some outfits and that weren't too heavy or ornate. These fit the bill perfectly! <end>  LOVE 'EM  Love, Love, Love these. Planning on buying same earring in other colors later!Have friends interested as well and so I passed on where I got them! <end>  mmmm  they are good but the real color looks nothing like the picture its a clear gray so if you want them because they are dark dont buy them <end>  Comfort and beauty  I love these earrings. I bought them as a present for my daughter and liked them so much I ordered another pair for myself. Very pretty and very comfortable. <end>

Have been wearing this since it arrived a few months ago and it doesn't irritate my skin or turn colors. Very Nice. <end>  18" Silver Curb 5.5mm Chain  Excellent time of delivery. The chain is well made,very good craftsmanship, and looks great. One (1) big problem. Chain was barely 17"s long and was more of a choker than a necklace. In the future will get 20" chain. Can make smaller but not larger. <end>  Not reall y 5.5 width.  It wasn 5.5mm in width but the seller told me that it may be so with all of Sabrinas necklaces.Also It says 22" in length but thats also counting the lobster claw and hooks. <end>  Nice Bracelet  This was a nice product although I had to return it as it was too big.

 B000B6S0ZK  Sterling Silver Heart Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 6 mm Ruby Red Colored 1 1/2 cttw ||	  Well worth the price  I love these earrings. I ordered 2 pair and I am sure glad I did. I got one for my daughter for her July birthday and the other one for me to match something I already have. They look like much more than a $20 pair of earrings. I like the color of the ruby too. Just a totally great buy for me at a fantastic price. <end>  Pink, not Red  The earrings themselves are cute and a nice size, but the color was not what I expected. They look much more magenta than "ruby red". All in all, a disappointment on color but I won't return them. <end>  pink  i was hoping for a bright red or really dark red, but they are more of a magenta color, but they are nice <end>  Great  I took the reviews of others and I agree - these are a beautiful color.

She was thrilled with them and they looked stunning on her. <end>  Cute but not red  Another reviewer mentioned these weren't exactly red so I knew going into it they might be dark pink and sure enough they were but they are still cute for my little girl. <end>  Beautiful  I bought these for myself & they are beautiful. The earings matched my knecklace & bracelets I got as gifts last year... <end>  The Pretty Earrings  I recommened u all buy these earrings there so pretty. And there cheap for the price. Its worth it. What you expect for this price 6.21bucks. Its worth every penny. I wear them everyday. I also get complaments on my earrings to. <end>

 B000B6TTMS  Sterling Silver Heart Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 6 mm Sapphire Blue ||	  Item as described  This pair of earrings is a little dark and might not sparkle as much as lighter colors, but the deep blue color itself is great. Upon closer inspection I saw that the stone on one of the earrings had fallen INTO the earring.. and that the little prongs holding the stone had become a little loose, but I fixed it within a minute with some pliers! <end>  awesome  recieved within 3 days of orderhigh quality stonesvery beautiful set for the pricevery pleased with purchase <end>  High quality  This earring set was received promptly and in excellent condition. The quality of the stones is high. <end>  Beautiful!  These earrings are perfect, they are a gift for my mom, but I might just steal them back from her. They are pretty small, but a fair size, very cute. Would even be perfect for a little girl. But they are beautiful and don't look cheap at all! It also shipped very quickly, and came in cute packaging I'll probably just pop a tiny bow on the box and stick it under the tree. <end>  Sapphire earrings  I found these earrings and fell in love with them. They are my birthstone and it is very hard for me to find earrings that I like with my birthstone in them. I was very excited to find them and a ring to match. <end>  Like Blue velvet  These are beautiful. They are as shown. I think of them like deep blue velvet. The post are long so you don't have a problem putting them on. They are so comfy I forget I am wearing them. What a great bargain. <end>

I am thinking about getting the Sapphire ones because of how happy I am with these. <end>  Good Earrings at the Right Price  I was looking for some purple amethyst earrings to celebrate a special event and came across these economical little guys. The quality is good and shipping was timely. Really hard to beat at the price too.

Good price and good value. I receommend to anyone. <end>  Sterling silver Amethy stud earringsst  We ordered very close to Christmas and had concerns about a timely delivery. We were not disappointed in any respect. The package was delivered in time for Christmas, and the quality and appearance were exactly as promised. The recipient was as thrilled as we were. <end>  Pretty  Pretty earrings, I bought them because I like the color and I prefer wearing studs. I think they're good for the price and recommend them. They maybe a tad darker than the pic though, but you'll hardly notice unless your like OCD or something. <end>  Cute  Quick Delivery, I haven't worn them yet, but they look like they'll last a bit! <end>  Beautiful  Beautiful earrings for a great price. It is a very good size and they can be wear with any occasions. <end>  Horrible quality  I received these a few days ago. Now while the shipping time was great, the earrings I cannot say the same for. Within minutes of putting them in, a stone fell out. I also bought another pair of a different style and color from this same seller, and the same thing happened. Within mere minutes of wearing, a stone fell out. I was sucked in by the lower prices than the regular silver seller I buy from. I got exactly what I paid for. Junk! I have learned my lesson that cheaper is not always better. I will never buy from this seller again. I wrote to them and still have yet to hear back. <end>

The clasp afixes to the heart charm which allows the bracelet to flow seamlessly on your wrist. The smaller heart is gold, the larger one is silver. I wear this often and it is a very study - rich feeling - rich looking - high quality pearl bracelet. This bracelet is also sized very well. Most bracelet are too big on the average womans wrist - this fits perfectly. Purchase this and you will be so happy you did. Dahlia is an excellent retailer - customer service is outstanding and their pearl items are of superior quality. I own many of their items and shop here for gifts for all my girls! You will not be disappointed. <end>  Junk  My husband bought this for me for our anniversary, and it broke the same day. It's beautiful, but the clasp snapped off after I had been wearing it for only a couple hours. Very disappointing. <end>
 B000B7PVW4  Sterling Silver Heart Hoop Earrings Handmade High Polished, 7/8" Long ||	  These are great!  I bought the Sterling Silver High Polished Heart Hoop Earrings, and I'm so glad. I love these earrings! They're cute as can be without being tiny. They feel hefty for their size without pulling on my ears. They're just gorgeous and part of the beauty is the high polish. These little earrings have "presence". <end>
 B000B7Q0RE  Sterling Silver Large Puffed Oval Shape Hoop Earrings ||	  Beautiful sterling earrings  The vendor was quick to respond to inquiries about two sets of earrings. The shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged to protect the high polish. The only negative is that I wanted larger earrings -- these were the largest I could find on the i-net. <end>
 B000B7SYPA  Sterling Silver 5.2cttw Clear White CZ Flower Necklace ||	  Prettier in Person  This necklace is absolutely gorgeous, the picture doesn't even scratch the surface. I have gotten compliments each time that I have worn it. It looks like a vine of sparkling flowers around the neck. <end>  fabulous!  This necklace is just wonderful. It is feminine and sparkly without being too big or gaudy, and the length is just right, just a little bit longer than a choker. It is exactly what I was hoping for, I may even wear it at my wedding next summer! <end>
 B000B7VA0Q  Rectangular Hinged Prayer Box with Leaf Design Pendant in Sterling Silver, #11526 ||	  heavy weight and intricate  This was a lot of nice work in a small package. I get a lot of compliments on this piece of jewelry. Looks great with a sweater. Very solid piece of silver. <end>
 B000B82Y64  Sterling Silver Medium Dolphin Earrings ||	  Dolphine earrings  Bought these for a friend after a surgery. Nicer than flowers. She loved them. Would buy again from this seller. <end>  Great earrings  This is a great pair of earrings and they are very comfortable! They are strong enough for you to wear them all the time, yet light enough that they are not weghing down your ear! <end>
 B000B84JFI  Sterling Silver Hollow Puffed Anchor 9" Chain Bracelet ||	  NOT what I thought!  Upon receiving this bracelet I discovered that I didn't like it because it appearsthe silver had been painted or applied to it. This is a sure case of " a picture can be deceiving". The bracelet had a feel of plastic not metal. I decided it would betoo much trouble to return so I gave it away. No I would NOT recomend this item. <end>
 B000B86AAU  Native American Style Sterling Silver Dreamcatcher Turquoise Feather Hook Earrings ||	  Pretty and lightweight  I love dreamcatchers, so when I found these earrings, I knew I had to have them! They are very inexpensive, beautiful, and fun to wear. I received many compliments! I found that they are very lightweight, which surprised me. <end>  Love these!  I love these earrings! They were just what I was looking for. They are a great size and very pretty. Fast quick delivery! <end>  Lovely dreamcatcher earrings  These are really lovely earrings. They are light and not too big, perfect for people with small earlobes. <end>
 B000B8G1P4  Sterling Silver Blue and Green Crystal Cluster Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Love them!  These earrings are true to picture and more. The clarity of the colors is excellent and they catch the light. These earrings are fun & flirty! <end>  Nice earrings  The crystal is very shiny and looks real. Item received as expected like the picture. <end>
 B000B8TVYW  Sterling Silver Teardrop Shaped Vitrail Crystal 1.5 inch Long Pendant Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  BEAUTIFUL!!  This is a quality item! The sparkle is amazing and I have received MANY compliments when wearing it. I plan on buying more to give as gifts. Absolutely beautiful! <end>  A gift  I bought this as a gift back in October 2012, and it was very small. It looked beautiful and I think my friend really enjoyed it. It does not come with a chain or anything to hang it on, so having a small silver chain would be ideal if you would like to wear this as a necklace. I was surprised how much color was showed, but it should be noted it does NOT look EXACTLY like it does in the picture. Still beautiful and I haven't heard any negative comments so far.P.S. This pendant also came in a very cute box, which made it look great as a gift! <end>  Nice piece of jewelry  I purchased 1 of the vitrail pendants several months ago. It was so pretty it glitters and changes color when it catches the light. I then ordered a second one and attached them to silver earring hooks, they make beautiful dangling earrings. Unfortunately I lost one and because I liked it so much I ordered another one. I also purchased 2 of the vitrail light pendants but the darker vitrail is richer in color. Very pleased with this item you will love it. <end>  Beautiful!!!  Love it & the bail (don't know if I am spelling it right) is big enough to go on several necklaces. <end>  Rainbow of colors  This pendant is a rainbow of colors that changes as it moves. It's very pretty and the price is reasonable. I've had a lot of compliments on it and enjoy the fact that it matches so many things. Two thumbs up! <end>  Fun Pendant  This pendant is great for outfits containing earthy colors but really doesn't go well with lighter colored outfits. I wear it to work and when i have meetings. Its weighty so you really don't forget that it there. <end>  Crystal Vitrail Pendant  Beautiful crystal pendant. We bought this for our 17 year old granddaughter. She loves it! It has so many different colors emanating from it. Truly a good value and a fun gift. <end>  Did not like it  The product looks much better on the picture, i did not like it and had to return it. <end>  If You're Mesmerized by shiny Things....  I ordered this pendant for myself recently and I have to say it is a very beautiful piece. The faceting is very well done and so it picks up and reflects a lot of light. You can see pinks, greens, golds, oranges, yellows. I love it. It's a nice piece for day or evening and if you are looking for a nice piece of jewelry that is not gaudy or overdone, this is an excellent choice. You could wear it with a long chain over a nice dress, or you could wear it with a short chain with a casual top. It's very pretty and versatile. <end>  love it  lovely if you're looking for attention or u want to get someone blind if you're being looked at.got 3 for important women and got to say they all love it. <end>  As stunning as the photo!  Rich greens with an inner firey reddish orange and deep gold center. I have had compliments each and every time I wear this stunner. It enhances your outfit nicely.These Swarovski Crystals are fun because they look great with casual, busienss, or more formal cocktail wear.I'm not sure how the clear ones would be, but I've bought 4 of the colored crystal pendents and they have been great weight, the gold-backed have been lovely and rich in color and the one that was a soft blue like blue topaz with jagged edges are all lovely.They look great with the Sparkling Diamond Cut Sterling Silver 1MM Italian Snake Chain necklace they have for sale -- very reasonable and the sparklet compliments the pendents and they glide on easily. I like the 24 inch length which is right at the top of your breast, the 30 inch length would be nice with longer sweaters (I've decided to order that length also.) <end>  Nice pendant. But take these reviews with a grain of salt.  The pendant is very pretty -- almost as pretty as the picture makes it appear. It's smaller and thinner than I'd expected but that's my own fault for not looking up the product dimensions. Facets are slightly more angular than the picture suggests. And the colors don't blend into one another quite as smoothly as the colors in the Amazon picture.The bigger issue  anyone buying this product on the virtue of these reviews should be aware that whenever Gem Avenue receives a positive seller rating, they request that their buyers review the products positively as well. Therefore, the reviews that appear here are skewed to reflect the buyers who liked the product, not those who didn't.I, for one, liked the product. But caveat emptor. <end>  Chips Easily  I have several genuine swarovski crystals that were expensive in comparison to the one I am reviewing . My daughter purchased one in Austria and I wore it everyday for about 2 years. I have several others that I purchased at mall kiosks and all have held up well. Although the crystal I am reviewing is beautiful, I have only had it for a few weeks and have noticed that it already has several chips. One side of the crystal actually has a noticeable gouge out of it. I can't explain how this has happened since I have not been scaling walls or rolling in sandpits recently (joke). All I can say is that the other crystal, several years older, that I have been wearing at the same time, is fine. It's not a huge loss, since the crystal was quite cheap. I guess "you get what you pay for" applies in this case. <end>  she likes it  hii ordered this pendant for one of my friends for X-mas, i gave it to her yesterday and she like it a lot, it s shiny ,reflect the light and look like it is a mixture of colors pinkish, greenish.very beautiful and classy.i highly recommended. <end>  Much prettier than the picture!  I am so impressed with this piece. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and it has become my favorite piece. It goes well with just about everything! <end>  Satisfied Customer  I am delighted with this pendant! Beautiful emerald hues, rich blues, pinks and amber tones--it really sparkles! I'm very picky about my jewelry, and always try to read all the comments first before buying, but I honestly don't have one bad thing to say about this piece. I recommend it highly. <end>  Love It!  My Daughter just loved the Swarovski Crystal Vitrail Pendant,She wears it all the time! <end>  New Sterling Silver Swaroski Crystal Vitrail Pendant  This pendant is very attractive and the ideal size to wear at any time. I was very pleased with it as I had purchased it for a gift. By no means is it gaudy and would catch anyone's eye - well worth the price. I plan to purchase another one soon. <end>  Lovely simple piece  This is a very pretty simple pendant that's nicer than I expected. The colors are brilliant without being gaudy. That being said, I think it looks best worn alone without other jewelry. It really is dramatic enough to stand alone. <end>  It's So Pretty!  This pendant looks great with just about everything in my closet. I've received several compliments about it already. So glad I bought it! <end>
 B000B8URL8  Sterling Silver Italian Tubular Mesh Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 3mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 20 inch ||	  very pleased  this chain is beautiful and made a perfect addition to a silver pendant for my wife for our anniversary.

 B000B8UT20  Sterling Silver Italian Figaro Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 2.3mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  smaller than I anticipated  Appears to be quality piece, smaller than I thought, however that's my fault for not reviewing and being fully aware of mm sizing..delivered on time in good condition...pricey for chain this small and thin, however if it holds up well to daily wear and tear it will be worth the purchase price... <end>  General recommendation for this maker  I have 3 Sabrina Silver chains, though not this particular style, two of which I've worn 24/7 for a couple of years. I can't say enough about how glad I am to have discovered this Amazon partner, because like the other reviewer here, I'm vulnerable to contact dermatitis from alloys. It's so bad I even get a rash on my tummy from prolonged contact with metal buttons on jeans. Nickel must be the chief culprit, because my Sabrina nickel-free silver chains have never raised so much as a speck of red itch. Durable, well-made, good-looking, reasonably priced, and biologically inert  )--gotta love it! Thank you, Sabrina and Amazon. <end>  Nice necklace  It's a pretty good sign of quality when I get this necklace mixed up with my white gold ones! You can't beat the price anywhere. Also, I'm very sensitive to cetain metals and this one doesn't irritate me a bit. <end>
 B000B8UTCA  Sterling Silver Italian Figaro Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 9mm Heavy weight Beveled Edges Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  perfect gift  I was skeptical of buying sterling silver online without viewing the item first. Much to my surprise the Figaro Chain was beautifully crafted, shiny and more than I expected. I would purchase from Sabrina Silver again. The quality of the item was extremely worth the price. If you are looking for good quality silver, they are the place to shop.Mary Del Signore, Cranston RI <end>
 B000B8UUZQ  Sterling Silver Oval Signet Ring Handmade, sizes 9 - 15 ||	  Nicely made  This is just a simple, basic ring. I had an initial inscribed on it and wear it everyday. Not flashy, just basic. <end>  nice ring for a great price!!!  wow, a little demanding on these reviews!! ring is great , it got here earlier than expected, was nice and shiny, and silver!!! seriously though, it is a very nice ring, the only thing i have a problem with is it is a pain in the ass to take off. i guess i'm size 10 and a half, instead of 10, but i do like it and will definitely be ordering from them again. <end>
 B000B8UWK4  Sterling Silver Large Square Signet Ring Handmade 3/4 inch, sizes 6 - 13 ||	  Sabrina Silver-sterling silver signet ring  This ring is beautiful and heavy silver. The best factor regarding this purchase was the service provided by Sabrina Silver. I had to mail the ring back due to a size question. The return and exchange were flawless. Sabrina Silver kept me totally informed via email throughout. I would recommend Sabrina Silver to any one wishing to purchase quality jewelery.Dr. R Gutmann <end>
 B000B8WFI6  Sterling Silver Italian Tubular Mesh Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 4mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 20 inch ||	  Medium Mesh Chain  Good quality for the money and stronger then some I have had in the past. Again its a good product for the price. <end>

 B000B8WGUS  Sterling Silver Italian Figaro Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 3mm Beveled Edge Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  company NOT good to deal with  I ordered 3 items. This necklace came to me with a nasty kink and a ring that had a dent in it.I had to send it back paying for the shipping handling......so I paid for the initial shipping and handling as well as the shipping and handling to send it backThis company is ripping off consumers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <end>  Love it!  My wife asked for this for her birthday (8/2010). Here is her review This chain is very nice, especially for the price and length and being nickel-free. I LOVE IT!!! It is a feminine thickness, delicate looking, yet sturdy.Unfortunately, the two pendants (filigree heart locket & marscarite watch) I had planned to switch off wearing with this chain are not this shiny and looked terrible with it due to the different finishes despite all three pieces being sterling silver.I like the 30-inch length for items to hang low and be tucked into a top. The filigree locket is used with essential oils on flannel for "perfume" and body heat helps it float around. The watch needs to be on a long enough chain in order for one to have maneuvering room to lift it and see the time. I ended up buying a stainless steel 30-inch chain that is serving these purposes and it matches the pendants instead of this pretty, delicate, yet strong chain.I've been wearing this chain without a pendant, though, over solid colored tops because it is so pretty and feminine. Eventually I will find the perfect pendant or charm for it. <end>  really good  my stuff came fast and was a good price. the product was also very nice. thank you. <end>  Think I will order more!  Sturdy yet delicate, high polish, have had many complements! . I ordered about 5 braclets from Sabrina Silver,,, Would absolutly order more ! Exceptional quality at very reasonable price.. <end>  love it!  was hesitant about buying jewelry over the web. but with outrageous prices at the mall, i went for it. the necklace is beautiful and perfect for my charms. i would buy again from this vendor in a heartbeat. <end>

 B000B8YGDS  Sterling Silver Italian Spiga Wheat Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 2.3mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Excellent and very strong!  I have been wearing this chain with a medallion hanging from it every day for almost 3 years. I have broken every single chain I have ever gotten in the past whether it be gold or silver, rope or box pattern, but this chain has never let me down. I cannot tell you how many times this chain has had hundreds of pounds of force on it while weight lifting, or how many times I have twisted it in my sleep, but it remains strong as new.I have gone through a lot of chains in my life and I am certain that if I ever manage to damage or lose this one, I will be buying the exact same thing to replace it. <end>  Atrractive, well made chain  It is a fair value for the price especially if you want something different in a silver chain. <end>  Stunning  Item arrived well before its due date, and was as advertised. The chain was well-crafted, and the silver itself possessed a stunning, white sheen. In fact, the white brilliance of the chain was so pronounced that the crucifix pendant for which I had purchased it - itself also sterling silver - did not match! Even so, I have kept this chain, because I am sure to use it as a gift. Related to this, I am pleased to note that the chain may grace the neck of either a woman or a man quite well, as it possesses traits of both refinement and strength. <end>  Exceptional !  Hard to find silver wheat chains...this isone of the best I've found. Strong yet refined ! <end>  quality piece  The necklace was to go with a locket I had purchased from another website. The description was very accurate for the measurements. It arrived within 3 days. This was a gift and I was pleased to give it to the recipient. <end>
 B000B8YGLK  Sterling Silver Italian Flat Mariner Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 2.1mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  30" Sterling Silver Baby Flat Mariner Necklace  This necklace exceeded my expectations for an on-line purchase. It is a beautiful silver necklace and is great for an every day wear. <end>  Simply beautiful  I initially was drawn to this item because the length is a little unusual - 9.5 inches - most anklets are 9 (a tad too snug) or 10 inches (a lot too loose). I also liked that it is nickel-free because I have a nickel allergy. I also liked that it is thin and flat. So it met all of my basic requirements and then some right off the bat. The best part is that it is more beautiful and shiny "in person" than it shows in the photograph - it is really beautiful. I have worn anklets for many years and this is my new favorite. I am thinking of ordering another 1-2 because I tend to lose them... You can't go wrong with this choice. <end>  30" Sterling Silver Baby Flat Mariner Necklace  This necklace exceeded my expectations for an on-line purchase.

 B000B8YLVU  Sterling Silver Heavy Round Rolo Link w/ Star Tag Bracelets and Necklaces, sizes 7, 8 & 18 inch ||	  Bracelet  Took over a month to receive first order. Second order was shipped (as a replacement) and took longer than it should have to arrive. Neither order could be tracked online. Finally received the original order, and it had a scratch on the charm of the bracelet. When the replacement order arrived, it was a totally different style and size. It was the cheaper version of the one I had originally bought. (the difference between a $50 bracelet and a $36 bracelet. I was not aware a different bracelet was going to be shipped) Will not purchase from here again. <end>

This bracelet is beautiful and the silver is very bright. In person it looks just like it does on line. It is sized accurately. It looks good by itself or with other bracelets. I would definitely order from this vendor again. It reached NJ from California in 3 days! <end>  Good Quality, Fast Service  I have several of these chains from this vendor; all are top quality and reasonably priced. <end>  Good overall service and quality  I loved everything about the chain that I bought. Delivery was speedy and everything arrived in excellent condition. Chain has a smooth feel and also a weighty feel so it feels ANYTHING but cheap. Great overall service! THANKS AGAIN! <end>

 B000BAKKOK  Tiny Gothic Spider Tarantula Sterling Silver Post Stud Earrings ||	  Poorly made  I loved this earrings and got a few compliments on them. I was disappointed that one of the spiders fell off about a month and a half after I bought them. I was taking them off them the spider came completely off. I loved the way they looked but were poorly made. Very disappointed. <end>  Incredible Detail  These earrings are an incredible value for the price. The detail is awesome. The post is a little long as other reviewers have stated so I wouldn't recommend trying to sleep with these on. Great addition to my versatile jewelry collection! <end>  Great Earings.  I bought these earrings with the Spider Necklace and the Spider Ring, and they match really well. Worth buying. Only complaint from my Girlfriend is that, like in the other review, It kind of pokes the side of her head because the metal spokes coming out of the earing, to go through your ear, is a bit long. But other than that, it is great! <end>  Tiny spider ear studs  Very good value for the money; good price and timely shipping. Should have eight legs instead of six, but a minor detail. I'm happy with the items. <end>  Arrived Broken, but I was sent a new pair  They arrived broken, but I called and was sent a new pair right away! <end>  Tarantulas  These are very well crafted little earrings. I love how they look, and the price just can't be beat! These have made me want to buy many more things from Silver Insanity! The only problem I did experience with these earrings is that the post is rather long, and it pokes the side of my head when I sleep. Otherwise, I couldn't love them more! <end>  They Actually Look Like Tarantula Spiderlings!  As a tarantula keeper (I have 5 at home), I always try to look for unique items such as these. Caution- they are really tiny! I've already lost one of them. (Guess it scurried away)It's nice to see that they actually look like tarantulas and not true spiders. <end>
 B000BANSPI  Iron Cross Crosses Pewter Finger Ring Spike ||	  Beautiful, But Minor Problems  Bought along withDETAILED PATTERN Design Silver Tone Pewter FINGER Ring SPIKE. I received this finger ring today, and although it's pretty with a solid feel, it has two small problems (that were not problems with the other finger armor I bought).First, some of the black coloring used to fill in the crosses has been smeared onto the middle section. In my case, however, this isn't any huge problem, because the way the base piece overlaps, it's pretty hidden, and it's a line at the bottom of the base, so even if my finger is curled, you are more likely to see it as part of the design.Second, one of the hinges has already broken. Again, in my case, this isn't a big problem. It is one hinge on one side on one section, and since the other side is tight enough, it has not hurt my ability to wear it at all. This breaking is partly my fault, since it's pewter and I bent it too quickly, but if only the hinges were made of a stronger metal, while the rest of the ring still pewter, I can't help but think it's durability would be greatly improved. In fact, I'm thinking of looking through the crafts store to see if there aren't some types of jewelry fastenings that I can replace the weaker pewter pieces with.Overall, this piece is still gorgeous, and for the price, it's a good deal. Despite the minor flaws, I'll still wear it out, and I know I'll have more than a few friends who will love it. <end>  bad judgement  This product was much larger than the picture showed. Also, It only would have fit a man's finger. It was almost scary looking and not represented well on line. <end>

It is very beautiful, nice color, very convenient. A lot of pockets for every jewelry that I have. Thanks. <end>
 B000BAULOY  SCER048 Sterling Silver Dainty Blue 10mm Donut Shape Millefiori Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Cute Dainty Earrings  The name says it all. These are cute and lightweight. They have multiple shades of blue so they match almost any blue item you wear. <end>  Very Pretty Blue  Got these for wife as she likes "leverbacks". This is her go to pair when she wants light blue, she actually likes them better than her way more expensive blue topaz/pearl earrings, I think I love Gem Avenue LOL. They show very well, are unique and she says very light & comfortable. Highly recommend. <end>  Way cute  These earrings came packed so carefully and they are so cute and delicate as well as dainty. LOVE them. <end>  How disappointing!  Based on how lovely the first pair of earrings that I ordered from Gem Avenue were (the little turquoise and black beaded ones pictured and sold now as a due with these)and the rave reviews here, I was anxious to add these to my wardrobe. But sadly, these aren't at all like the first pair though they closely resemble the turquoise pair in the pictures. Simply put I wouldn't have purchased these at all had I seen them. They are a flat cheap looking silver mounting, and the blue (stones??) are much darker than pictured and honestly they look like plastic beads from a cheap jewelry making kit!! According to this ad, these earrings originally sold for $40 and are now on sale for $20! I would've walked away from them completely had I seen them in a shop. I WILL give Gem Avenue a star for prompt delivery AND the earrings were packaged beautifully sealed in a tiny bag inside a nice gift box. But the product itself is sub par. I can't believe these earrings got all these stars!!! I am returning them for my $20 that I can spend on products with this same company that ARE far and away more superior. <end>  Pretty, but I wish they were symmetrical!  These earrings are very pretty, and look to be well-made. However, be aware that the large blue beads are NOT symmetrical, as shown in the picture. They bulge out on one side of the earring, so they look cheap. When worn, they look okay from the front or back, but the side view reveals the asymmetry. I tried slightly bending the wire of the earring, but it didn't help. These were for a Christmas gift, so we didn't have enough time to return them or get a new gift... I'm hoping the recipient either doesn't notice or doesn't let it bug her. It bothers me, though, because I assume that beads are always symmetrical. It almost looks as if the hole that they put the wire through is slanted or off to one side. Hard to explain, and I wish I had taken pictures... Trust me, if you're buying these for yourself and have the time to return them, go for it. Hopefully, you won't get a bad pair like I did. If you're getting them as a gift, I would look elsewhere. <end>  Sterling Silver Dainy Blue Donute Shape Earrings  Although the spheres are larger, more oval, and a lighter blue than shown in the picture, the earrings are beautiful. <end>  Great little earings.  I love these earrings, they are very comfortable, not too heavy. I have several pair in different colors. They have help up well over the past yr. I get many compliments on these earrings and you cant beat the price. <end>  Day or Night  These lovely crystal earrings are perfect for daytime or dresses up any outfit for night. I couldn't believe the fine quality for such an amazingly low price. They make my blue eyes sparkle. <end>  Great To Wear Anytime  These dainty blue earings are so cute and a joy to wear. I love the blue color as it goes with a lot of my clothing. The lever clasp ensures the earings stay on. These earings are not too big, but dangle a nice amount with my short hair. I like these Swarovski earings so much I have the blue pearl set too. <end>  Everyday comfort earrings  These earrings are not only beautiful but very well made. They are also very comfortable to wear and the leverback locking hook is very strong. <end>  lovely just perfect  I was given an AMAZON gift card for my Birthday and these were my purchase. I am a Sterling Silver gal and these earrings are just lovely and certainly fit the bill for me. The beads are beautiful blue and the quality excellent. Even better is they arrived way before promised. I would likely recommend this item. <end>  Cute, but it looks like I could have made them myself  I love dangly sparkly earrings and these seemed to fit the bill, but I was hesitant to buy them based solely on a picture. There are definitely bright and attractive, but up close they look a little cheap, like I could have bought the pieces at Michael's and put them together myself. I'm not sure they were worth $20 but I have gotten a compliment or two! <end>
 B000BAUXSI  Big Blue Iron Cross Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Nice Pendant  I bought this necklace as a symbol of my German heritage. It's larger than it's shown in the picture (and larger than I assumed) but it's ok. The blue paint is pretty, the pendant has smooth sides. Shiny and beautiful.It comes with a black cotton rope chain, which I cut off because the rope was so stiff, and replaced it with a chain. I think it looks better with a chain.Overall, five stars, I was impressed with this pendant. <end>  Blue???  This cross is so dark it it black. In bright light you can almost see a tinge of blue. Nothing like picture. <end>  Great pendant, but that cheap necklace has gotta go.  The Blue Iron Cross pendant is made of pewter and is about an inch and a quarter in height and width. The ring for the necklace has been widened, apparently, since this item's original release- I recall buying one back in 2005 or so and the ring was much smaller. Guess Dan Jewelers- seems they're the maker- got some complaints about that. I appreciate their efforts, but I think they could've gone for a medium instead of large ring-size-increase. Anyway. More importantly, while the pendant came very nicely packaged in clear plastic, placed in a small black pouch no bigger than the palm of one's hand, it had for a necklace a much-too-cheap rope-thing. Some kind of black synthetic rope material. The older one I had came with a simple metal chain necklace- like that found on dog-tags- and that worked a lot better. That's what I did with mine- took the chain from some surplus ROTC dog-tags, and placed that on the pendant instead. I'd like to see the manufacturer give us a choice of factory-issue pendants, but it's not that hard to do a little extra work and get the right necklace yourself.Having been sold since 2005 at least, this Iron Cross pendant has certainly endured on the marketplace. There's at least two other versions, the difference being the color in the center of the cross- the other two are red and black. This pendant is well-made and looks good, and the price of $13- plus shipping, of course- I paid is about right. I can certainly recommend it. <end>
 B000BAV2XI  Multicolor Amber and Sterling Silver Elegant Designer Modern Earrings ||	  Nice item to go with ring  I received these earrings along with the matching ring as a gift. The earrings match the ring nicely, but also work fine alone. The colors of the amber are very nice, even though the pieces are on the smallish side. I enjoy the fact that they are not too big, but still show up nicely (I have long hair). They appear to be solidly made and I've had no problems with the quality of these or the matching ring. Amber does require a little more careful care than other stones (it can scratch easier and hairspray can make it look like plastic), so you will want to make sure you have a good place to store any amber items. The earrings and ring both came in nice boxes that I use to store them when not in use. <end>  Great earring  These earrings are beautiful earrings I am very happy with this purchase I ordered the matching ring and it looks better in person <end>  Uniquely Gorgeous  Love these earrings...I receive so many compliments on them. They are well made and so unique. Plus, the multicolor Amber is beautiful with such a warm glow. Can't go wrong with these. Enjoy! <end>  unique earrings  I am actually wearing these today. I get all kinds of complements. Love them and have the ring that matches. <end>  Even better in real life than they look online!  Ian Valeri products continue to stun me with their quality and value. These earrings are gorgeous; unbelieveable for the cost. So glad my relative looked at my wish list and bought/sent them to me! I love them. <end>  Unique  These earring are even prettier than their photo. They're one-of-a-kind and have recieved many compliments on them. I look forward to more unique finds from this vendor. <end>  Great earrings!  I just received my order, and the delivery time was faster than expected. I also ordered the ring, and I was pleasantly suprised that both products actually looked better in person.So far, the earrings are comfortable. The ring takes a little getting used to. I'm wearing it on my middle finger, which is usually bare.All smooth edges, so it doesn't snag on clothing. <end>  Not good  I cannot speak to these earrings, BUT a few months back, I bought the amber ring and the necklace from the same line.The stone fell out of the ring last week. The ring got tossed. Aside from that (lol), it wasn't bad-looking. I was only slightly disappointed when I first saw it.The necklace was three little rectangles of amber in a vertical line. They are SO small that you really can't see the detail when worn. The width is about the same as a pre-wrapped american cheese-food slice. The chain was also thin and wholly unremarkable. I don't think I've ever worn it. But I'm hte perfect consumer--too lazy to bother returning it.I wouldn't trust the earrings either. <end>
 B000BBF2HE  Drug Allergy Medical Id Jewelry Bracelet ||	  just what i was looking for  Needed this to go with the drug allergy card I carry around with me, fast delivery & also have the option to make any changes to the engraved portion, you just have to contact them within 24 hours, great services will use company again. <end>
 B000BC2QNG  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 7mm Round Emerald Cubic Zirconia Post Back Stud Earrings ||	  Perfectly Pleased.  These earrings are great. Well-made (sterling silver), yet inexpensive enough so that I don't worry about losing one. I wear them constantly, in one color or another. <end>  Beatiful  These are absolutely beautiful! They have a great sparkle too. I was very pleased. I would highly recommend them, especially at the price!! <end>  very pretty  these are great earrings & are a very deep shade of green. look real. a real buy. wonderful vender also <end>  Finally, Some Simple Green!  I had looked everywhere for SIMPLE &#34;emerald&#34; earrings, and was so happy to find these! I do like them, but they are definitely darker green than the photo, and I wish they matched the photo more closely. <end>
 B000BC8H02  New 925 Sterling Silver Swarovski Heart Crystal Pendant ||	  clear heart pendant  looks so pretty in the picture, not so in reality. brought it for a friend, almost didn't give it. <end>  not real swarovski  This pendent looks ok for the price. However, it doesn't look like real swarovski. I discover this store sell a lot of so called-swarovski items. But, they look like some ordinary plastic. You get what you paid for. <end>  Not as it looks!  Heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal Swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all. Same thing in on other sites for like $1. Speedy delivery was the only positive. <end>  Simply Beautiful  My daughter, a fan of the "Twilight" book series was looking for a crystal heart to make a recreation of "Bella's bracelet" from the story. This heart charm was just perfect. She adores the beautiful crystal heart. The heart reflects light beautifully and has made her the envy of many of her friends that are "Twilight" fans as well. Thank you for providing such a beautiful piece at such an affordable price. <end>  Maria  I was very delightfully suprised at how beautiful this pendant was. I bought several and gave them as gifts. Everyone who received one thought they were beautiful. I was not disappointed and will gladly buy from this merchant again and again. You cannot beat the price for the quality of the product. Thank you for offering this merchant through Amazon. I never would have found them otherwise. <end>  Swarovski Heart Crystal Pendant  This dainty heart looks absolutely beautiful on. It picks up the colors of your clothing. It is an amazing price for such a beautiful pendant. <end>  pendant  I ordered a Swarovsky crystal pendant which I thought was clear like one I had purchased once on a visit to a Swarovsky factory. The one I received is clear but not like the first one. It is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one. I was disappointed. <end>  Beautiful  what more can I say it is just a beautiful piece but not for an adult ..I bought for my daughter and fit her perfect <end>  Crystal Pendant  The item was smaller than I expected but overall for the price I am satisfied. <end>  Spectacular!  This is a simple yet beautiful piece to have. Turn it one way it's blue/pink, turn it the other way and it's gold. Spectacular!! <end>  Excellent product  Heart pendant exactly as shown.Very beautiful. Came very quickly to Canada.Very impressed with whole transaction.Would definitely recommend. <end>  Compliments all the time  I bought this pendant last year and I am still receiving compliments on it. I really liked it except (just as someone else commented), it has a strange yellow tint in the middle. However, the tint only shows up when I'm wearing a light color shirt (white mostly). This is the only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars.I hope I've helped.  ) <end>
 B000BC8RX4  SCER053 Sterling Silver 8mm Clear Cube Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Twinkle, twinkle little Star!!!!  Love them. Great price. Always feel special when I put them on and get many compliments. Careful and fast shipping. Probably will buy another pair for back up!!! <end>  Nice go-to earrings for everyday sparkle  I think these are really attractive, they go with everything, AND are a bargain for the price. They look much more expensive than they are because of the type of lever earring back. This makes them much more secure, too. I find myself reaching for them more and more often and often get compliments on them -- they provide just enough tasteful sparkle without being over the top. <end>  Crystal earrings  Love these earrings. I have gotten many compliments on them. They are well made and go with every outfit I have. <end>  Very pretty and dressy  These earrings are so pretty. I usually wear them for dress up because they seem a little fancier than the other Swarovski earrings I bought. <end>  Beautiful!  You have to see these in person to appreciate how beautiful they really are. They are so shiny, i feel very pretty in them. They look very expensive too, much more than the cost.They also go with any color. They are just beautiful! <end>  buy from these guys, seriously  While the pictures and specs are right on? THESE FOLKS ARE PROVIDING TRUE QUALITY PRODUCTS. I'd have paid at least twice as much for these earrings and still not felt cheated. Shipping was really prompt,too  I got my stuff almost before I'd ordered it! <end>  Beautiful  The earrings are beautiful and just as described. They got delivered really fast to. I will order again! <end>  Rita  If you are looking for a pair of earrings to go with everything these are them , they are so beautiful, they catch the colors you are wearing, everybody that sees them tells me how pretty they are and want to know where I got them, my mother in law just adored them when she saw them; To surprise her I bought her a pair too she was so thrilled to get them , and I will definitely purchase more , and it was also quick and easy to order and quick to receive them, also excellent price for the quality ,and it comes in a pretty silver box for gift giving. <end>  Great Earrings  Dazzling is the correct word for these earrings. The size is perfect for a dangling earring. Couldn't ask for more. Great product. <end>  lovely earrings  I recently purchased these earrings and like them very much. Easy to put on and have received many compliments on them. Can be worn casually or dressy. <end>  Eye catching jewellry  Very pretty, the coating on the crystal makes it shine in so many different colours, and catches the eye, even if mostly hidden by hair.I docked one star though because the cubes are a little bigger than I expected them to be. Other than that, they're great for partying, casual wear, etc. <end>  crystal earrings  Dazzling Clear Swarovski Crystal Cube .925 Sterling Silver Leverback Drop EarringsI bought these earrings for myself. Crystals are the right size and a real eye catcher in the light. I would buy them again <end>  Lovely earrings!!!  These earrings are even more lovely than I imagined. I am completely satisfied with them! Great price and quality!!! <end>  Beautiful Crystal Earrings!  These are my favorite crystal earrings. They look like ice crystals hanging from your ear. I wear them all the time and becuase of the crystal color, they match anything. I highly recommend these to anyone who likes sawarski crystal. These are magnificant! <end>  COLORS OF LIGHT CATCHES EVERYONES EYE  I ordered these earrings and when arrived put them on havent taken them off. This size is great and not over powering at all. Love it when everyone is looking past your face towards your ears and saying love your earrings, those must have be expensive! I would highly recommend going ahead and getting yourself a pair, like said size is great. <end>  dazzling  i really like the look of the swarovski crystal just wish they were longer or had matching bracelet to go with them. it really beautiful. <end>  Beautiful crystal  I bought two pair of these lovely earrings, one for myself, and one for my sister. She absolutely loved them. The price is great, and so is the quality.You will not be disappointed in this one.They have become my signature piece. <end>  Easily Smudged  These earrings, though pretty, are very easily smudged. For something intended to be worn against the skin, this is a BIG NO, NO. When you first put the earrings on (after washing) they are sparkly and pretty. However, about an hour later, after bobbing against one's skin (particularly those of us with oily skin, I suspect) they look like a completely different pair of earrings. The oily smudges on them change the look from sparkly crystal, to cheap plastic. For a decoration (not worn on the body), the material is great, however as an earing, I wouldn't recommend them. <end>  Opulent and dressy  These will make perfect daytime formal accessories, church, weddings, showers, etc. They have all the shine you can imagine. <end>  Eye Catcher  These really catch the light beautifully. I really like these and would highly recommend them!! <end>  Luminescent  I am a happy customer, had ordered the earings 3 days ago and i all ready have them !! I am very pleased. My sister originally had them and i liked how they looked so i decided to get a pair of my own, and the price is great. i love the way the earing shines has a almost a luminescent look  ) very cute dangles  )would recomend for every woman  ) <end>  Great gift  Bought these for a friend because I am so pleased with all my purchases from Gem Street. She was awed by the sparkle, beauty and delicate style. <end>  Beautiful!!!  I Love swarovski everything!! These are beautiful earrings with lots of sparkle, and just the right size. They will go with everything, casual or elegant. I highly recommend Gem Avenue for any swarovski jewelry. I have purchased several items from them (all swarovski) and each piece is a great addition for me, nicely made, and beautiful. Thanks bunches!! <end>  Simply gorgeous  I was actually looking for a differently cut pair of earrings to match a necklace when I saw these. The square shape caught my eye because they reminded me of a squared cube dimestore ring I had as a child in the 60s. They looked so pretty and unique in the photo, and having found what I was searching for, I decided to treat myself to these earrings. They are simply gorgeous! Also, they are just the right size, not too heavy, and the lever back is most comfortable to wear. I must add that you can buy with confidence from Gem Avenue, for my earrings arrived quickly, securely packaged and in perfect condition, and they are decently priced. <end>  nice casual earrings  The cubes on the earrings are slightly bigger than I thought they would be, giving them more casual look than a dressy one. Not very elegant, for a casual look they are ok. <end>  Beautiful earrings!  I received the most beautiful earrings at a very reasonable price and with very fast shipping. I would highly recommend Gem Ave for your earring purchases. <end>  Purchased for a gift  The person who received them are saving them for a special occasion. She loved them. <end>  Great Earrings  These earrings are great. They are very high quality and shine a lot. They are very light and comfortable to wear. These earrings will take on the color of whatever you are wearing. I suggest you also get the pendant, it is a great pair. <end>  fab !!  I give them an "F".......for FABULOUS !! They are well made, are clear cut and sparkle. I have ordered many things from this company and have NEVER been disappointed. <end>  dazzling earrings!  I gave these to my oldest daughter for her birthday and she really lovesthese earrings. They are very sparkly. <end>  It was a lot smaller than I expected.  It was a lot smaller than I expected. <end>  pretty  these were a xmas present for my sister-in-law...didn't have much expectations for them. They showed up and were pretty. Not as shiny as in the picture but still nice. I would say they are a little over priced <end>  Pick up the colors around them  Just in case you're always like me and look for the Amazon verified purchase, these were bought for me by my husband via his account so tou won't see it. I have added a few pictures of these earrings being worn. I love the colors these earrings reflect. The more bright light, especially sunlight the more colors they reflect. When I wear blue they seem to reflect a lot of blues, same with other colors I wear. The lever backs are easy to put on with one hand. Since I can only use my left hand (previously right-handed) this is very important for me. I hope I've added enough pictures for you to get a better sense of the relative size of these earrings. I'm wearing grey in the pictures and the pictures show the minimum of colors I have ever seen reflected. Another review has some wonderful pictures showing the colors reflected. Don't be scared off by the picture that looks like the back has a solid dark color. It doesn't exactly. Sometimes a side does look like it's coloring is solid but it is a much lighter, glassy look than the picture. Plus, you actually have to look for it. It was so subtle the first time I noticed it that I wasn't sure what I was looking at. <end>  pretty but small  pretty but small these were very hard to get on and or off maybe a teenager would be able to wear these i couldn't <end>  Clear Cube Crystal Earrings  From the picture they looked to have some purple in them but they are clear just like the title says. <end>  Christmas gift  I wanted to keep these for myself !! Very pretty, catching all colors of the rainbow. You won't be disappointed. <end>  Beautiful  This has a very high &#34;price to sparkle&#34; ratio (great value)! Nicely made. My wife loves them. While I would love to give my wife &#34;real&#34; gemstone jewelry, I have a hard time justifying the look versus the price (I don't feel like they look as good as these types of stones without spending a small fortune). Maybe its a guy thing. I don't think you can ever go wrong with Swarovski crystals. <end>  Very nice earrings  I gifted my wife with this earring and she loved it. Great product. This goes both with her formal and casual wear. <end>  SCER053 Sterling Silver 8mm Clear Cube Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements  I just orders these earrings and I am very hard to please that are just beautiful and hang well. I plan to order more for gifts.. <end>  Gorgeous!!  So sparkly and shiny, I fell instantly in love and more just like them!! Perfect size, not too gawdy and they don't look like costume jewelry. <end>  Pretty, but not clear and a little cheap looking.  At first glance I thought these are pretty earrings (they do sparkle and shine), but is states "clear" so that's what I thought I was getting. Once I put them on they look as if some part of it is painted (yellow no less), which makes them look a little cheap. Also the part that goes in your ear is curved which makes it very difficult to put them on. Sorry but I don't think I will be buying any more. <end>  Swarovski earrings  Two pairs of the Swarovski earrings were purchased for Christmas gifts. They arrived in plenty of time. The receipants were delighted with their gift. The earrings are beautiful and sparkle with myriad colors. They were purchased through the Amazon marketplace. <end>  very pretty!  I get a lot of complements when wearing these... When light hits em they sparkle so nicely, very much recommended! <end>  cute but not total Sterling silver  Earrings are very cute but i do have to apply clear nailpolsih behind the front of the clasp of the clasp because it turns my ear black while wearing them. but other than that i am very happy. <end>  Just gorgeous  These are so impressive. They sparkle and shine and have just the right amount of glitz! They will go with any outfit and make you feel pretty. I am very happy with them. I had gotten them for a friend and liked them so much that I went back and bought myself a pair. <end>  Really pretty earrings  I ordered these earrings for my mom's birthday this month and they just came in. Only took about 5-6 days to get here.They came in a small silver box with cotton batting. They were inside a small plastic bag. I took them out and inspected them for quality.They shine beautifully when the light hits them. Clear at times and then a kalidescope of colors at other wave lengths. Really neat feature. Definately a Swarvoski piece. The leverbacks open and close well and are in alignment. The sterling silver finish has a high gloss and looks great. The length of 1.5" long is just right for anyone. I feel these earrings are a great buy - price, quality and final appearance. Even my husband felt these looked much more expensive than they are when I was showing them to him. I am looking forward to wrapping these up and giving them with some other goodies for my mom's big day.These are a great pick for young girls, middle age or older. Quietly sophisticated.Do buy - I think you'll like these too. <end>  Lots of Sparkle  The SCER053 Dazzling Swarovski Cube Crystals Earrings are beautiful and sparkly. Can be worn with casual or elegant attire. They sparkle from every direction. They are a little bigger than what I expected, but I still love them. The back side of the crystal does have a covering on it. I believe the back coating is used to reflect the light back through the earring. The covering in the back is still transparent (check out the pictures on the main page). Every color of the rainbow shines through. It also depends on the color of clothing you are wearing, since that will also be reflected through the crystals. I have attached several pictures so you can see for yourself the sparkle, size of the earrings and the back of the earrings. <end>  Love these earrings!  Very comfortable to have on and very pretty - lots of sparkle! Very elegant - somewhat on the dressy side though I think today anything can be worn anytime. These are very pretty earrings especially for the price! <end>  Swarovski crystal earrings  They are so lovely and received so many admiring comments from strangers that I bought a pair for my sister. Very lovely, Indeed! <end>  Love these earrings!  I look first for leverback earrings. I lose earrings very easily and these I know won't fall out. Secondly, size matters. I like smaller earrings that still catch your eye. Third, I LOVE Swarovski crystals. These earrings are perfect for me. They sparkle like diamonds, and the style is great! They look expensive without BEING expensive and I plan to purchase more soon! Thank you! <end>  Nice, but small.  These earrings are nice, but a LOT smaller than I expected. I'd estimate each side of the cube is a centimeter long or so. They do sparkle nicely though <end>  amazing!!!!!  I love these earrings- they go with everything I own! I wear them all the time. <end>  Lovely with a Snowflake Crystal Necklace  I bought these to go with a Swarovski crystal snowflake necklace, because I like it when you mix styles that complement one another. These earrings were perfect for this 'ad-hoc' set!Crystal Fantasy Snowflake NecklaceThese sparkling earrings are quite dazzling, and not-too big. The only thing that could have been better was the packaging. It arrived in a tiny plastic baggie, not in a gift-ready box, but that was easily remedied with a trip to the drugstore giftwrap section. I think these look more expensive than they are, and look amazing. <end>  Great Swarovski Earrings!  I received the Swarovski cube earrings the other day in the mail and I was very much surprised how beautiful they really were and how much they sparkled! The earrings are much prettier in person than what they appeared on line. I received the earrings earlier than the previous date mentioned. Thanks Gem Avenue for the beautiful necklace and earring set! Both of the products that I purchased from you are gorgous! <end>  Highly recommend these earrings!  While I was unsure, thinking these would be a bit too dainty and not show up with my long hair, I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened up the package (which, by the way, arrived very promptly). The picture is accurate, but truly doesn't do them justice. They are a good size (although not huge), very good quality and SPARKLY! I would recommend these for anyone from aged 13 to 90, and at this price, why not?? Another bonus - they go with absolutely everything! <end>  fp  Dazzling is correct way to describe. Go with all outfits. The crystals give the earring a classy look. Would recommend to all. <end>  Dazzling Clear Swarovski Cube Crystals Earrings  I bought those earrings for myself. I like Swarovski's products for their great quality. Earrings are gorgeous. Everyone asks me where did I buy those earrings. I like them also for the price. <end>  Swarovski Cube Crystal & Sterling Silver Earrings  These are beautiful earrings. The Swarovski crystal just sparkles. I bought them as a present for my daughter, and she loves them. <end>  Sparkling but not gaudy  I wanted to give my sister a small gift and took a chance on these earrings. She loved the earrings; they do look lovely without being gaudy. I love how they catch the light. And you can't beat the price. <end>  Lovely earings  These earings are lovely, light-catching, and comfortable. Theyare all I hoped when I ordered them. <end>  Great sparkle, pictures doesn't do them justice.  These earrings look so clear and sparkly. I'm not convinced that they are genuine swarovski crystals because one side of each crystal does have a very faint coat of gold paint (you have to look very hard to see this), however I also saw that on some of the jewelry at the actual swarovski store, so that may be how they should be in order to make them sparkle as beautifully as they do. I gave these away as a gift and all the recipients were very happy. For the price this is definitely an item worth getting. <end>  Pretty earrings!  I am very satisfied with these earringsfor they are lovely and I get many complimentswhenever I wear them. I think they are a greatvalue at the price offered. I would certainlyrecommend them to a friend. <end>
 B000BCA0F2  Bowling Grandpa Lapel Pin ||	  So cute!  This little pin is every bit as adorable as it looks in the picture. We are looking forward to giving it to Grandpa this year as part of a bowling-themed Christmas gift. It came packaged very well and in a timely fashion. <end>
 B000BCD52W  Medical Emergency ID Bracelet - "Penicillin Allergy" - Hypo-allergenic ||	  Got What I expected  I was pleased to receive the item that I saw in the picture. It is very sturdy and has not rust after being submerged in water on numerous occassions. <end>  Bracelet  This is a great product.It can help save lives that's why it is so important. <end>
 B000BCE9PO  Sterling Silver Round Clear AB Crystal 0.75 inch Long Pendant Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  another disappointment  I ordered this item to match the earrings also offerred. Again, this product was such a disappointment! I love Swarovski crystal, so I expected the same quality one would expect, given the reputation. However, it looks like a very poor imitation. It is so ugly that I could not even give it away without embarassment!! <end>  Swarovski?  Unhappy with purchase. I should've known by the price. I collect Swarovski crystal. The disc looked good in the pictures but... <end>  Too small for a pendant  I owned a beautiful necklace with a pendant that was exactly like this one, only larger and very well built. My necklace was stolen and I ordered this one, thinking it was the same pendant, but it wasn't, it is very small, does not stand out. <end>  Good Everyday Pendant  This pendant I classify as the best for casual wear. I wear on the weekends or out & about but isn't not suited for my work or my going out events <end>  Elegant piece  I love this pendant. It sparkles even out of sunlight. It is simple but elegant. I wear it with jeans or whenI dress up. Of all my necklaces, this is the one I always reach for. People really notice and admire thiscrystal.M Labrie <end>  simply and powerful  This pendant is simply beautiful - sparkling and changing color depending on what you are wearing - reflects sun and any light beautifully. I got it in set with matching earings - even a better idea! The cut makes it special.It is a gift for my sister, I am very satisfied. <end>  Disc crystal earrings  This pendant was a Christmas gift (as well as the earrings) for my neice. She absolutely fell in love with them. The color changes according to what clothing you are wearing and what light you are in. Well worth the money. Thanks <end>
 B000BCGQLE  Sterling Silver Globe Harmony Ball Pendant, 3/4 inch with snake chain. ||	  Looks so much better in the picture  I received the Globe Harmony ball today and the only thing that qualifies it as a globe is the fact that it is an orb - it is supposed to look like the earth (including continents) but it is just a smooth round silver ball. I expected the harmony ball to chime but just sounds like a cheap bell like we had on our roller skates as children. For $57.36, I am stunned. I would not recommend anyone purchase this item if they are expecting to receive the item pictured. <end>
 B000BCMX8Y  Sterling Silver Large 1" Globe Harmony Ball Pendant, with snake chain. ||	  This pendant exceeded my expectations!!!  I am utterly amazed at the exquisite quallity of this pendant! I highly recommend this piece. It's very beautiful and luxurious. <end>  Global Harmony  I love this pendant. It is high quality, the chime is beautiful and I wear it very frequently. Shiipping was quick and packaging was secure and protectve. <end>  GREAT  THIS IS A GREAT COMPANY TO DEAL WITH.VERY CUSTOMER FRIENDLY. GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SATISFIED. I'LL BE BACK AGAIN ! <end>
 B000BD3T86  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 6 mm Blue Topaz Color 2 cttw Brilliant Cut ||	  Pretty earings.  This pair is also good to replace amethyse stones when you go on holidays.They're sparkeled and light.They're more prettier than in the photos. <end>  Wow  These are BIG ! Wish they were smaller but I should have read the description better. <end>  Amethyst colored sterling silver studs  They are very pretty earrings, nice and clear, a very pretty shade of purple. prettier than the picture. I got out my ruler when I read the measurements, but they are still a lot bigger than I expected. <end>  Amethyst colored Silver Earring  After wearing these earrings only a few days, I lost the stone out of one of the studs. <end>  Beautiful color  These earrings have a beautiful, clear color. Very pleased with the quality. I bought a pair of sapphire at the same time, and they don't compare. These are my favorites! <end>  Incredible.  I bought these for my girlfriend expecting cheap costume jewelry and for what they are they're a beautiful shade of blue, fairly decent sized, and have great fire. If you're considering a small gift for a special lady, this is a great buy. <end>  Try to wear it more often  I think the best thing in it is the bright clear colour. It has the only minus - too small back, but despite of this, it's never unfasten by itself. It's very cute and good quality. <end>  OMG!!!!!!!!!! I LIKE IT SO MUCH!!!!  I was finding a pair of sterling sliver earrings that i can wear it everyday even when im taking shower, and it need to be purple. There was so many purple earrings but were not sterling sliver, so when i saw this one, i know it should be mine. <end>  Very good value  These earrings were a terrific value for the price. Beautiful,clear, and appear to be well made. I would definitely purchase these again. <end>  Great value, lots of shine!  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these earrings considering their low price. They truly sparkle, shimmer and shine! On the pair I received, the purple seems to be paler than the pictures show, but they are still lovely earrings. The back that holds the earring in place seems very small, but actually with the smaller size, they are comfortable when sleeping. I also ordered the emerald pair, and they are just as lovely. The green on the emerald pair is much darker than the purple is on the amethyst pair. I'm pleased with the purchase, and will look for them in other colors and shapes. <end>

 B000BD5RJK  Pugster Tribal Blade Mens Stainless Steel Necklaces Pendant For Men ||	  A unique piece of jewelry with a personality  I purchased this set as a replacement for the one my wife broke.This is an awesome and very unique product. The glass design can (and will) vary. The string for the necklace may not provide an "expensive" look but it won't distract from the main element, the glass piece itself.The only caution is that if you drop the earring/necklace on a hard surface (my wife did with the first set), it will break. It's glass, doh!So keep your honey happy with a unique gift set or your mom or whoever wants to have a unique piece of jewelry with a personality. <end>

 B000BDBJIS  Pugster Murano Glass Millefiori Black Color Square Flowers Pattern Pendant Necklace For Women ||	  Save up for a something sturdier  I bought this a few months ago and was pretty happy with it. The cross is beautiful. It has a nice stainless steel finish and it's very modern. However, the loop is not sturdy. The second cross broke off somewhere and now I'm left with an okay pendant, but I didn't pay for okay. Buy this cross only if you're going to take it off at night and aren't a very physical person. <end>

 B000BERQ34  Garnet and moonstone earrings, 'Moonbeams' 2" W 5" L ||	  Moonbeams earrings  I like these earrings very much. They're very long, which I like a great deal, and they are very pretty. They're not my usual style, but they've grown on me. My only problem is that they're a bit heavy; I can't wear them comfortably for very long. <end>  Lovely, long earrings  I bought these for a friend who has long hair and a lovely long neck. She was thrilled to get them and looked great with them on. They are very fluid and move well. <end>
 B000BEV5WC  Amethyst earrings, 'Lilac Clusters' 1" W 2" L ||	  Beautiful, but heavy  When you receive the earrings, they are in a beautiful package. I was surprised upon first seeing them though  They were a lot rounder than I thought they would be. I had pictured them a bit leaner and longer, and instead they are like small round balls. They are also pretty heavy, but I have sensitive ears and they still work for me. That said, I have received many compliments wearing them. They are definitely very chic. <end>
 B000BEW0GW  Natural orchid gold-plated necklace, 'Charming' 2" W 3" L ||	  Amazing!  This necklace is just beautiful!! You can see it is a real orchid. You can use it as a pin also if you do not like to wear big pendants.It is worth the price and waiting time... <end>

 B000BFHHGE  Emerald and topaz necklace, 'Majesty' 1.6" W 0.2" W 2.4" L ||	  Beenu's "Majesty"  This necklace is gorgeous. Some of the emeralds had inclusions (tiny dots visible inside the stone) ranging from minor to major. It is difficult, though, to find a completely flawless emerald, especially at this price. The inclusions are part of the formation of the emerald and give the stone character. The blue topaz stones are brilliant, and the zircons add a defining sparkle. The chain that the pendant comes with is made of thick, bright silver. This necklace is a unique piece; one that I am proud to own. <end>
 B000BFNO6Q  Spike & Chain Skulls Crystal Axe Pewter Ring ||	  Dan's Jewlery  Every piece of jewelry that I have purchased thru Amazon I have bought from Dan's and I love everything I have.

 B000BGT1VM  Pugster Queen Elizabeth Italian Charms ||	  Blink and it might disappear  Buyer beware. Take your left or right hand. Now look at your pinky finger. Go to the tip of your pinky finger. Depending on the size of your hand, the tip of your pinky might be larger than this "Italian charm." No charm here. I am not moved. <end>
 B000BGV18I  Pugster Fortune Teller Italian Charms ||	  vgill  Be aware that these links are VERY small. It is difficult to make out exactly what is on the link. When looking at the picture on line, I thought it would be large and easier to see. However, the link does fit nicely with any blank links to make a bracelet. <end>

 B000BHOBJI  Florentine Napa Mini Jewel Box ||	  Nice sturdy case  I bought this to put in daughter's book bag in case to store her hearing aids and related tools. The small pockets are nice for holding extra batteries and the bag in the middle is perfect for protecting the hearing aids from the rest of the cleaning tools. She loves that it's purple to match her book bag. <end>

However, I've had a problem wtih the spacer clips opening and falling. It has happened a couple of times already but I've been fortunate enough to find them on the ground. Not sure why it won't stay closed but it's a matter of time before I lose it for good. <end>  The Lady's Colors!  I ordered the"evil eye" bracelet in my mother's favorite colors. When I wear it I think of her and how beautiful she is!!! <end>

 B000BIXJ0Y  Go-Go Grey Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Like it!  I like the color of this tongue ring. I also like the fact that it's not a painted color. <end>
 B000BIXKCQ  Red Black CROSS Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Cracks easily, but the price makes that irrelevant  There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points - End stays screwed on relatively well- WILL crack if you bite on the balls accidentally- Does not irritate or inflame tongue- Not uncomfortable to wear <end>
 B000BIXKFS  True Love Red Stripe Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  *CAUTION* Swallowed Ball  I was lying down to go to sleep when I felt something weird in my mouth. Well it turned out that the top ball from the tongue ring had some how undone itself, and fell in my throat. This is not the first time that one of the acrylic tongue rings that I have orderd from this web site have done this. Most of them the ball from the top cracks and it just comes off. It's quite irritating. <end>
 B000BIYMV4  Peace and Love belly button ring 3/8" ||	  Beautiful  This belly ring is simply beautiful! It's a prefect fit, unique style and eye cathcing. I have received many compliments for it. I am extremely pleased and recommend it. <end>  Very nice  I've had this belly button ring for over a few months now and I still love it. The quality is great.

 B000BIZNZI  White and Black Full Gothic Cross Logo Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Just your typical piercing jewelry  There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points - End stays screwed on relatively well- Not very prone to damage / cracking- Does not irritate or inflame tongue- Not uncomfortable to wear <end>
 B000BIZO3E  Black and White Alien Logo Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Ball Is WAY Too Big  Product looks exactly like it was described and came in a small bag that wasn't opened. However, I haven't even worn it because the ball is extremely too big, it's actually bigger than any other tongue ring ball I've seen. Very uncomfortable. <end>
 B000BKDPAQ  5mm wide Hematite Gemstone Band Ring Size 4 to 12 ||	  Beautiful ring, great price  This is a goegeous ring. I absolutely love it. It's a bit more grey than black, and very shiney. It also came in the cutest little gift box. I would recommend this ring to anyone who likes hematite. I would suggest getting at least a half size larger than your regular ring size, though, as stone rings don't have the give that metal rings do. This ring is fantastic; I love it! <end>  Great ring  I was actually worried about buying this, because I had heard from a lot of people that hematite rings broke easily, and I can be ridiculously clumsy and rough, so me and fragile things do not mix. But I have had no problems, I wear it every day and it seems very durable. It is also beautiful, I like it better than similar more expensive rings I've seen in stores. <end>  smooth as silk  I was expecting a black band, what I got was this beautifully crafted and shined and smoothed to a perfectly rounded edges so it is perfect for my fingers that tend to swell in the cold. It look wonderful and feels great and I have worn it since I received it and I always get complements on it as always well done!!!!! <end>  Black is always in  This ring fits me perfectly and I absolutely love how it looks, the picture doesn't do it justice. I wear it all the time. <end>  nice looking ring  Got this ring for the gf, She has a small frameand discovered that this size will fit the ring fingerof a woman with smaller size hands. Fit hers perfectly.Photo doesn't do it justice.Came attractively gift wrapped. I'm thinkingof getting a bigger version for myself. <end>  Absolutely love it! Does wonders for my arthritis!  I LOVE this product! I've got arthritis in my left hand, and this product helps to keep my hand from locking up on me. Works much better than copper! <end>  My fiance loves his.  I bought this ring to replace a similar one that my fiance broke. He was really upset about it because I had bought it for him at a Medieval fair that we'd never get back to. Luckily, I found this on Amazon and ordered it. He was thrilled, and glad I didn't pay much for it, despite the original only costing a dollar. I may have a hard time getting him to exchange it for the gold wedding band I'm giving him! <end>  Great ring!!!  I am very satisfied with the Hematite ring...and the service I recieved from Gem Avenue and would purchase other products from them!!! thanx for the quick delivery and service!!! Clay <end>  looks great but so fragile  It is a really beatiful ring.unfortunately it is so fragile.If you aren't careful it can break easily.(as mine, buuah) <end>  Exactly as presented! Wonderful!  I was actually surprised when I opened the package for this ring because normally when I buy jewelry online it hasn't been acurately represented. It's normally smaller or a slightly different color or something's off. Most of you who buy jewelry online know exactly what I'm talking about. Well, imagine my surprise when I opened the box and saw EXACTLY what I had ordered! I love this ring and was hoping that it wasn't too far off. I am very happy with this product and the seller. I highly recommend them to anyone! <end>  Nice ring for a great price!  It's a nice quality ring for $4.99. Nice, solid black with a wonderful shine. Don't use the ring sizing guide that Amazon.com offers. Go get your finger sized at a jeweler or walmart/kohls/target - where ever rings are sold. Because this one is a bit big, I'm going to order another that's the right size. Will probably get a few different gems. Definitely recommend buying from this seller if you like what you see.--added note-- Ring broke a few days ago while washing dishes. Not happy that it didn't last more than two weeks!! Certainly have to be careful when wearing this ring. <end>  pretty ring  I really like this ring. Because of the medium it fits on different fingers at different times of day. I was worried it would break because of other reviews but so far I have not had a problem. <end>  Hematite rings  Love the rings,they are beautiful and so comfortable on your finger,couldn't be more satisfied.Totally recommend this product and the seller,thank you again. <end>  Poor quality material  The ring is beautiful. The quality of the ring however is poor. My husband was wearing the ring for three weeks when he picked up a pebble and was tossing it in his left hand when the ring shattered into five pieces. Hematite is poor quality and should only be worn on special occassions. <end>  WARNING  This ring is very fragile I have only had mine for about 2 weeks and it has broken. Once your ring breaks its gone for good. I was very disappointed when this item broke in two. If it breaks and you want a refund the company Gem Avenue wrote this item is fragile. If you want to wear this ring 24 hours a day or during the day i would not suggest buying it. <end>  Hematite rings  This was exactly what I was looking for. Since these rings are stone, they only last so long before they break. Finding an internet source has made it a lot easier to continue my use of the natural power around us. <end>  ring  Great ring. A really great buy for the price. Very durable. Just don't drop it. <end>  Pretty ring that I love  The ring was well packaged and a pretty box and is a perfect fit. Very beautiful and I received many compliments, a great purchase and I wear it every day, carefully, since I read previous comments on how delicate it is. Thanks Gem. <end>  not actually black  hey, for 5 bucks (10 after shipping if it's by itself) -- you can't go wrong, but a  the size is weird, i got a 9.5 since the 9.0 i have at home is a tad too tight for my right ring finger, but this 9.5 is IMMENSE, it even fits on my thumb. and it's actually silver moreso than black, contrary to the picture.shipping came through np though etc. again, 5 bucks? why the heck not <end>  Great, but a little fragile.  This ring is great; it has a really interesting black shine, as you can see in the picture. The only thing I have to say is that it's a tad fragile--I noticed a small crack on the inside of it after a few weeks, and it hardly did anything more than tap a desk. If you get one, be careful with it  you don't want your money to break in a matter of weeks. <end>  Awesome ring!!  This ring is beautiful. Bought a size 10 for my thumb and it looks absolutely brilliant. Be careful and not drop it though. It is very fragile and will shatter if it hits a hard floor. I always take mine off if I'm cleaning house or mopping the hard floors. <end>  This ring is great!  I wear a lot of clothes in blue or black and this ring seems to go with everything I have. I must admit I thought it would fit my right hand and instead fits perfectly on my left, but on either hand I love it! Shipping was extremely fast and I love the box, too  o) <end>  Great buy  this is his girlfriend and I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. its really smooth, shiny, and great for a guy. it shiped very quickly, that was great. so i tottaly recommend this product to anybody. check it out. <end>  Understanding Hematite  I know that everyone is talking about how it's very fragile and it breaks easily etc, etc. I think that maybe you do not understand the purpose of hematite. Hematite is intended to absorb negative energy and balance you out. However it has a peak, and when it has absorbed too much negative energy or stress, it breaks. Which is why many people sell them in bulk. It is actually a very sturdy stone if you're optimistic! So those people who's ring only lasted 2 weeks, it's the stress not the ring! <end>  Happy  I was sketchy to get a ring online as a gift for someone but the ring fits well and is a bit thicker than I'd like but my grams loves it. <end>  I wear it with my other rings!  I actually wear this ring on top of my other rings that are too large to keep them in place and it looks gorgeous to boot. It's very sturdy. I'm not at all gentle with my jewelry and I can't find a nick on it yet. Still shiny as a pearl! Amazing little ring, I wish hematite came in all colors. <end>
 B000BKQZ6M  Sterling Silver Black Leather 20" Cord Chain Necklace ||	  If you can't get your pendents on it, how good can it be  I own over 100 pendents. Of them, I found only about 8% had holes large enough to thread this through them. More thought should have been given to practical aspects of this cord. <end>  Looks Nice  Quality of leather looks nice. I can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off. It's metal squeazed to leather and that's what I expected. You just have to keep an eye on it and don't sleep or shower in it. It looks nice. <end>  Surprisingly A Nice Cord Necklace  I just got my 20 inch leather cord sterling silver necklace today, opened it up and quite surprised the see a good quality product for the price. I ordered this cord as to go with a medallion pendant I ordered from Amazon.com! I think this new 20 inch cord is going to do the trick, for I felt that the 16 inch leather cord that comes with the pendant was going to be to small. Glad I did, for this 20 inch just rests where my neck meets my chest, about an inch bellow my atoms apple, it will definitely work. The only air of concern I have with this necklace is those sterling silver ends. For now the clasp system will probably hold up for a great long while, but the wield or solder point that connects the o-ring to the leather cord, where the clasp connects by clasping the opposing end, it's material there is pretty thin. Now I'm just looking forward in getting the rest of my order from Amazon.com, as to complete this new leather cord necklace. And as far as "wait time" for the necklace to be delivered, it was right on time! <end>  20" cord necklace  One end of the fastener came off after a short period of time. I didn't take the trouble to contact the company as I was able to fix it myself so I can't say if they would have taken care of it (although I'm pretty sure they would have, I didn't want to have to ship it). I was a little disappointed that it didn't wear better. <end>  Strong Than A Chain  I love this cord chain. It's much stronger than a chain and it's a nice look. Looks great with a black dress or low cut top. <end>  Cord Chain  Love my cord chains. Perfect with any type outfit. Equally good-looking on either sex and with any pendant. If you haven't tried them I recommend that you do. <end>  Good value, Good Piece  Hey, itsa necklace, but wear it alone, put a pendant on it (When you can get back from your spouse), or jus torder more than one....One of many happy purchases from this vendor <end>
 B000BKY94M  Lobster Lapel Pin ||	  Nice crustacean you got there  This is the nicest crustacean themed lapel pin you're likely to find. It's not gaudy and bedazzled like most, and at a glance people know it's a lobster, unlike half the pins on this site. If you have a lobster lover in your family or circle of friends, this is the pin to buy. <end>
 B000BKYTOC  Pink Glow-N-Dark Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  Too short  I was really excited when I got the item but it was shorter than the listed length. After three days of wearing it a got a bumb on the bottom. I believe it was because the jewelry was cheap. <end>  Color looked weird..  The color looked alot different from the picture. It only glowed for a minute, if that and it just wasn't very cute. <end>  Doesn't last  I bought this for my 20 year old daughter. The balls won't stay on the ends, she is constantly losing them. It does glow in the dark, though very dimly. She is not very happy with it. <end>

 B000BL0DSM  White Miracle Ball Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  Not what I expected.  I received my belly ring today and I was very surprised with the shipping since it is holiday season, but the product is not as pictured. The balls are a dirty white pearl color not the glittery white as pictured. It it also super long. I don't know if it's made for people with piercings farther back or what but it sticks out way to much for my comfort and I took it off after an hour thinking I may rip it out on accident. <end>
 B000BL0DW8  Psychedelich Sky Blue Star Acrylic Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	   )  Seriously, even if this WOULD HAVE been a crappy piece and broke the first time I wore it, it still would have definatley been worth it for 99 cents! <end>
 B000BL2B3W  Grape Glitter Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  great  the item was in great shape. the material is very good, but it is much smaller than what it appears to be. <end>  Terrible purchase  The first day I wore it one of the balls was lost. It must have fallen off during the day and I didn't notice. Now I cannot wear it anymore <end>
 B000BL2B64  Electric Blue Miracle Ball Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  Really big...  These belly button ring is cute but it is very very large so it sticks out pretty far from my stomach. I thought the two balls would rest against my kin, but they literally stick out like an inch. <end>
 B000BL2B82  Swarovski Siam Aurora Double Gem Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  lovely  I really like this product. It sparkles! Really, the 'gems' are very nice and don't have the dull look of plastic. <end>
 B000BL2BAU  Red Aurora Ball Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  Aurora ball spiral  Sticks out too much for my flat stomach. Gave it to a friend -she likes it. <end>  Not a Fan  I bought this product quite some time ago and I'm convinced that it is the spawn on Satan. I absolutely HATE getting ripped off, so I guess I'm glad that it was so inexpensive, but I'm still very disappointed with how terrible it was. The ends are made out of cheap plastic; I think that says it all. It took a great deal of muscle to even twist off the cap. Your hands have to be in perfect condition, meaning not too dry or too wet, otherwise you'd be unable to twist it off even with muscle power. Once you get it off, you realize that you unintentionally destroyed the tip of your new navel ring because the plastic is so cheap that it chips with little effort. If the poor quality of the product weren't enough, the hideousness of it is. The shape seems like an interesting idea at first, but it looks awful once you try it on; it hangs weird and the only way it wouldn't is if you glue it, hold it in place, or stay in a stationary, seated position. Maybe some people like it, but I don't see how they possibly could unless they were packing several extra pounds in their stomachs. All in all, I would not recommend this product for anyone looking for body jewelry of good quality and appearance. Believe me, this offer IS too good to be true.*[The sparkly pink and blue ones are just as equally terrible, so DON'T BUY THEM!]* <end>  Red spira naval ring  I have a problem where I can only use a certain kind of metal for my belly ring like a certain kind of steel or where my piercing is gets all red, and this did not do that at all it was fine, no redness it did not irriate my belly at all, but if I had my pants up too high or when I was sitting, it pressed into my skin and was very uncomfortable, and after about a day of having it in I had to take it out because it began to pain. So it is good for like a one day thing, but you can't leave it in to long. <end>  Red Aurora Ball Spiral Twister  Wasn't sure if i would like this belly ring or not but I figured for the price, I would give it a try. It's a little tricky to get in, but once it's in, it looks AWESOME!!! <end>  i wounden'd buy it again  I don't like that product at all.1 it doesn't look good in real live, because the product is very poorly made and is made out of cheap material.2 It seems like a new interesting Design, but if u have a flat belly the two plastic-balls will hang facing downward of your belly.3 it's not like the other Piercings where u can choose you mm length and as expected the metal loop is way to long.4 It's easy to break, it got a little crack all ready when i first screwed it open. Then if you closed it it will re-open, but if u screw it so hard together that that doesn't happen it will break.5 This Design gets easy stuck on cloth etc. so it's easy to hurt u.I had belly Button Rings for 7 years and i have to say that hole Rings with a click-ball and the standard Design are the most comfortable to wear and u cant hurt your self by getting caught on your cloth and they don't fall out easy and don't break usually.The ones which have a big rounding like a sun around the belly button look good on pictures but never when you wear them. On thin people they stick out on people with more fat they kind of mash in. And they are soooooooo uncomfortable especially when you sit. And they Stick out of your T-shirt etc.The ones with the hanging jewelery look very nice but can break easy if made poorly and i would just get ones with round hanging ends so they don't rip on the towel ofter showering or cloth.So i hope i could help you  ) <end>
 B000BL46SK  Red Black Cross Spiral Twister Belly Ring ||	  This would look great on Shelli's Belly! Cool colors!  I dropped by to read a few reviews of one of my Amazon Friends and this belly ring caught my eye first! NO ... It's not for me. Too old for that kind of stuff, (I would get laughed out of town!), but I thought it would be good for Shelli's belly. Shelli's my granddaughter and she has a variety of these rings--and she likes red--so I think she'll like this one.I gave it a five-star for color and design. I'll let you know how Shelli likes it, but not till after Christmas ... It's one of her Christmas gifts. <end>  pretty cool design...  First time I ordered from Body Candy and their delivery was prompt, but the shipping charges were almost as much as the item itself.I like this belly ring--no sharp edges to hurt you. It's the first time I tried a spiral twist and it was a bit harder to insert. My only complaint is that the screw ball fastener is plastic and the twist is metal, so it's not going to last that long, but for the price, it's worth the short time. <end>
 B000BLFPCG  Yellow Little DUCKY FACE Belly Ring ||	  Weird  The head of the duck is gigantic, and its cheap plastic. Really cheap. *no pun intended*..I thought this was cute when I saw it online, but once you receive it you realize what a waste of money it was. Wouldnt ever buy again. <end>
 B000BLRWRM  Surgical Steel 8mm Autism Awareness Jigsaw Puzzle Wedding Band Ring Matte Background, sizes 8 - 14 ||	  puzzle ring  I was looking for a ring with puzzle shapes on it, as I have 2 sons with the diagnosis of autism. I found this ring, and fell in love with it instantly. The price was right, and the detail is amazing. I have worn it every day since I received it. <end>  Love it!!!!!!  Fast delivery & ring looks exactly as shown. Not wearing as a wedding ring but as a ring in love & support of my 4 y/o son with Autism. <end>  You get what you pay for ... nice but virtually invisible pattern.  This looks great in the picture, and it's a nice little ring ... but it will look like a nice little ring. The pattern is etched so low and thin only you can see it and only when you hold it close to your face ... and I have 20/15 vision. If you want to show support, this is, sadly, not going to do the trick. I gave them 2 stars only because the size was correct and the material seems to be good. If you insist on buying it ... tell everone what it is so they know. <end>  I wish there was a much narrower band, but the puzzle pieces are perfect  The band is pretty thick, but the inside is nicely smoothed and edges rounded for comfort. The puzzle pieces are subtle but clearly there. I just wish that this came in 3mm and 4mm for those of use who prefer a more narrow band. We have the 6mm band as well, and it's still a little thick for us. <end>  Wonderful item  Beautiful ring. The detail is great and it is high quality. Ring is thicker than I expected but still fit perfectly. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I received this ring very quickly. I am amazed at how nice it really is. The pictures don't do it justice. Quality is superb! <end>  LOVE IT!!!  I purchased this ring after shopping around and looking at several different ones. And I love this one! It is super thick and the design is faint but yet detailed. I have been very happy with it! <end>  Really nice ring...  I ordered the ring at size 10 and it fit perfectly. The Surgical Steel 8mm Autism Awareness Jigsaw Puzzle Wedding Band Ring Matte Background, size 10 was exactly as described. <end>  Great looking ring!  I'm allergic to most metals so surgical steel or nickle free is the only thing I can wear. When I saw this band I had to have it. I have a son who was diagnosed early and every time I look at it, it reminds me of my son and my wife at the same time. <end>  snug  I LOVE this ring! It is very snug because of the thickness of this ring,if you are wanting to buy this ring, buy it a size larger.The ring is just beautiful and although I bought it b/c both my boys have AutismI am using it as new wedding band since I go through rings so often.I don't think I will ever have to replace this ring and am going to buy my hubby one too. <end>  love it  I ordered this to be my soon to be husbands wedding band. We are on a small budget and were looking at stainless steel rings since his job involves a lot of rough work that any other metal would not hold up to. This ring was far below our price range, no one can believe it was only $5! He loves the puzzle pieces and I also love the symbolism since I have two autistic brothers. Other reviews stated that the rings are made small, so I ordered a 9 since he wears an 8.5 he's a very skinny little man) but it was far too huge. There are no half sizes so I reordered an 8 and hoped it would fit. It is still loose, but fits well enough. <end>  Just like the pic  I got just what I ordered with this ring. The picture looks just like what I got. The size is not as off as some of the reviews seemed to say but I'm completely happy with what I got. I love it! <end>  Awesome ring!  The ring is awesome. Pattern is practically identical to the picture. My only issue was I ordered the ring a bigger size, because I heard it ran little small, but my ring came just right and ended up being just a tad loose, so I'd recommend buying your regular size and if it doesn't fit, there is an exchange policy, which I think is great! <end>  Exactly what I was looking for!  This ring is exactly what I wanted. There are embossed puzzle pieces all around the ring. Giving it a 2-dimensional look. It does come smaller in size, so if your an 8, I suggest getting a 9 instead. Other than that, it's a very nice ring. <end>  Almost perfect!  This puzzle ring has special meaning for me because my daughter has Autism. I read the other reviews and ordered a size bigger, but I wish I ordered the smaller size as it is slightly too loose. I still love the ring! I wish it came in half sizes, then it would be perfect. <end>

 B000BM4TSG  14k Rose and White Gold 3.0x25.0mm Diamond-Cut Hoop Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Nice Earrings  I purchased these for my mom about 1 year ago. She loved them. Overall good quality, small but cute. The diamond cuts give them a little sparkle. I now use them. <end>  Me anote 20 puntos...

 B000BM4UG2  14k Rose Simple Stackable Bangle - 7 Inch - JewelryWeb ||	  Rose gold bracelet - gorgeous  I am in shock how lovely this bracelet is (once I got it out of the three large boxes it was in - it was wonderful going through each succession of box until I got to the small one). Haven't taken it off my arm yet. Very pretty, dainty. Perfect gift. Rose gold is my new favorite jewelry. I doubt you'd be dissappointed. I certainly wasn't. <end>
 B000BM6ZD8  14k Tricolor Hinged Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  This looks a whole lot better in the picture than it does in the real world  No part of the gold shines. I don't expect rose gold to shine but neither the yellow gold nor the white gold shine either. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't do it. <end>  Stylish & cute  These are really cute earrings, but I was expecting the backside of the earring to be solid; it's not. I guess that makes the earrings lighter in weight, but it also makes them seem cheaper in quality. Still, I'd buy them again. <end>
 B000BM710Y  14k Yellow Channel Set Cubic Zirconia Toe Ring - JewelryWeb ||	  great  Love the toe ring, got it for my sister to replace one that broke, this one is much better made and she was thrilled. <end>

 B000BM9454  14k Yellow 2 mm Large Tubular Hoop Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Classic and Sexy, but Prone to Falling Off  My wife looks like a million dollars with these on, especially when she's wearing them with Guerlain KissKiss Lipstick, in Very Gold of course. What an awesome combination, I mean, really powerful stuff.Plain gold hoops are classic and classy, even when they're big, as this pair is. These are not Foxy Cleopatra, dinner-plate big, but they're certainly above average, which makes them a standout. They make themselves known whether her hair is down or up, and they always look magnificent. I've heard these things called "whore hoops," and could not disagree more. That's a sad and dated attitude, and is just plain wrong. When I become Philospher-King, every woman will get a set of these, free, and should wear them often.The one serious drawback to these earrings is that because the hoop is so big, there is a relatively large amount of flex and give in the hoop. This is a function of its diameter and weight. My wife and I discovered very quickly that the posts for these earrings are not long enough to compensate for the give and flex of the earrings as the wearer moves around, especially when walking. So, they tend to fall out; the post slips from its hole behind the ear, slides out of the earlobe, and is out and off. If you're not paying attention, you can lose this earring in a heartbeat, and that's an expensive loss.We fixed this relatively quickly by taking the earrings to the local jeweler, who added about 4mm to each post. This keeps the earrings on just fine. But mind you  this means you have to open up the earrings a little bit wider to get them on, to get that longer post into your ear and through its hole on the back side. Take care not to open that hoop too quickly or too wide or it'll bend and the only way to take the crease out of the bottom of it will be an expensive visit to the jeweler.Bottom line  Get a pair of these, ladies, for yourself because you're worth it and you'll look stunning in them. Get these, guys, for your lady because she will look so damn good with them on, which will come back to benefit you in many pleasant ways. <end>
 B000BMCSMK  Carrot Lapel Pin ||	  smashing! Exactly as shown  A simple and elegant design suitable for men or women. Made from lead free pewter, environmentally friendly from a company with a social conscience. The amount of detail on this little pin is delightful, I am very pleased with it and was happy and proud to present it as a gift (although I did gift box it first as it arrived on a simple piece of card). Was sent to the UK from the USA very promptly and arrived in excellent condition. Highly recommend products from this company. <end>

The one that was shipped to me was another style entirely. When I sent an email to the company, they replied in an email telling me that I would have to have a specific form to return the chain, but that they were out of the forms and would send one later. Of course, I never heard from them again. I just gave up and used the chain they sent, even though it was not the one I ordered. There is nothing wrong with the chain - quality and design are fine - it just wasn't what I wanted. <end>

 B000BMMMH6  Shimmering Sterling Silver and Genuine Opal Band Size 8 (Sizes 6 7 8 Available) ||	  Shhh! Don't tell anyone how inexpensive this ring is!  This ring is really cool. It's a darker opal color, so it's good for either a man or a woman. The shipping was fast and it came in a nice box. I highly recommend this ring & this vendor who has many other jewelery products equal in quality! <end>  Very nice ring, great value, wife loves it  A very nice quality ring for a bargain price. My wife hasn't taken it off since she got it for Christmas. <end>  Great service  We ordered a size 6 and it arrived quickly and is beautiful. Many people have complimented my wife on this ring. <end>  Goregeous ring!  Wow..on a recent trip to Hawaii I bought some Hawaiian silver jewelry with simulated opal inlay. I saw this ring and knew it would compliment what I already had. Gosh,this ring is beautiful and quite good quality and color. I was thrilled and wear it all the time. <end>
 B000BMUJJY  14Kt Yellow Gold Judaica Menorah Pendant ||	  Menorah Pendant  I looked everywhere for a menorah pendant until I found this one. It was exactly what I wanted and I have gotten many compliments on it. The back is flat as I expected, but the front contains all the details as seen in the picture. The bale is not soldered, and it would be nice if it was because it is the perfect size and I wear all the time. With the price of gold going up, this is a good value. I am ordering one for a friend who liked mine so much. If the bale was soldered, I would give it 5 stars, but since it isn't, 4 is a good rating. <end>  Menorah Pendant  Beware - this product looks nothing like the picture. There is no detail - just a tiny flat piece of gold and definitely not worth the price, and the bale is not even soldered. I sent it back. <end>
 B000BNQ7LC  Family, Friends, and Faith, Beaded Stretch Bracelet Set ||	  Great Gift  I wanted something nice for Christmas for a group of my closest girlfriends but didn't have a lot to spend. This was the first Christmas that all of my friends were Moms and I wanted something to reflect that we were friends and Moms and was very skeptical that I would find such a thing. I was delighted to find these and even more pleased when they arrived in a pretty drawstring bag. My friends loved them. I kept the small price I paid for them my secret. I felt like this gift really showed my friends that they were special to me. <end>
 B000BNY840  Sterling Silver Lock Charm Ring ||	  Love it !  I love this ring! It's super cute and I get compliments about it all the time! I had also ordered another item that i needed to send back and the customer service with Eves Addiction was exceptional. I'm a happy customer!  -) <end>
 B000BOADHA  Steel spiral - Zero gauge ||	  Attractive but *very* heavy  I had been looking for silver metal spirals for a while, so when I found these at a decent price, I jumped at the opportunity. Like a dork, I didn't notice that they were selling one at a time (never really understood why they did this?) so be aware if you assume earrings come in pairs.The biggest "disappointment" came from the weight of these earrings. They are so heavy, they literally elongate the holes in my lobes when I wear them. I love them but I can't wear them for too long without risking overstretching my gauges. I also have to wear them "backwards" in order to keep them from sticking straight out from my head. <end>
 B000BOB82O  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 7 mm Black Color 2 1/2 cttw Brilliant Cut ||	  Nothing special  I made this purchase after stalling on buying black CZ's a long time. Black CZ's tend to be sort of nothing and disappear, nothing to make them stand out. The thing that changed my mind was that these earrings were described as "Brilliant cut". I am not a jeweler so cannot tell you for sure that these are or are not brilliant cut, but the name has always meant to me that the gem will have numerous facets to display special brilliancy or reflective quality. These earrings do not have much sparkle, as the cuts are not numerous, seem small, and are restricted to the further-most edges of the stone, leaving the flat black top the most visible. Thus, the earrings appear like black buttons. If you want a very subtle dark gem, these might be for you, but I wanted sparkle to bring them alive and be a bit eye-catching, and it's barely there. <end>  Black CZ Stud Earrings  Gorgeous earrings and fabulous quality. All of this seller's merchandise is just stunning. I've never been unsatisfied with any of my purchases from this seller. Impressive jewelry at wonderful prices. <end>  Loved them!!!  I loved wearing these for everyday usage. They were small,simple but flashy. They were built good and everything, just one night I thought I was a UFC champ and wrestled my friend and lost them in the brawl hahaha but I would totally order these again in a set for back up. <end>  Pretty stud earrings, but butterfly-clutch backs are very small  These are nice, basic black stud earrings and the price was a deal (paid $7.69). As the other reviewer said, they are not extremely dimensional, but they sparkled enough for me. My only issue is with the butterfly-clutch backs. They are half the size of normal butterfly backs, which makes them a little difficult to manage. And if you lose one, you can't just borrow a back from another earring, because it will most likely be too big and fall off. I don't know why they made the posts so thin, since the earrings are plenty big enough to have normal posts. But overall they are a good buy. <end>
 B000BOCDC8  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings 6 mm Black Color 2 cttw Brilliant Cut ||	  Very Pretty!  I purchased these for a gift, and they are very pretty! Despite being black, they are shiny. I did order a smaller pair of this identical set for myself, but I regret not purchasing a second pair of the 1 ct. I will definetly order them again. <end>  Black CZ 1.0 Carat Size Brilliant Cut Stud Earrings  The price is cheap but the item has a tiny cut in the face. However, because its price is cheaper than the shipping cost, so that, I did not send it back. <end>  Right size and price  The stud that goes through the ear is a little thin and short. It works fine for me. But if you have thick ear lobs you make have a problem. <end>  Black CZ studs nice product  I just received the earrings today and I have to say i was pleasantly surprised. For the price I am very pleased. This is supposed to be a christmas gift for my BF and the size is just perfect. I will buy more products in the future. <end>
 B000BP3CFY  Sterling Silver Italian Magic Herringbone Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 3.5mm Beveled Edges Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Pretty and comfortable but too narrow for me  I'm petite with a small wrist; I thought this bracelet was pretty but, surprisingly, too narrow for my liking. I prefer the 5.5 mm width bracelet in the same style. Someone wanting a narrow bracelet will like this. This bracelet would also look good layered with other fairly thin bracelets. <end>  very upset  i ordered this for my wife and were supposed to get it by the 11th. its the 12th and well its still in transit. im very upset that i was told a date and its been exceeded. everything else i have ordered has came early. i dont understand! <end>  Good transaction  This was shipped promptly and it was everything the seller said it was. I'm very pleased with the necklace and hope to do more business with them.Judy <end>

One was too small or was the wrong length. I did a search on herringbone necklaces and I was surprised when Amazon popped up on the screen. I didn't know Amazon had THE BLING I WANTED. The necklace is everything & more of the description. I LOVE IT AND I AM HAPPY WITH THE PIECE. <end>  Great piece of jewelry  This order of a herringbone necklace was quickly fulfilled and the merchandise is wonderful!!

As an added bonus, it's nickel free! <end>  Great Necklace  Great item. My wife had one that we bought for around $50 at the mall and it had her breaking out in a rash.This item is nickel free.

 B000BQ6YC6  Pugster Size 7 Spring Flower Rings ||	  cute but cheap  I loved the ring on the picture. It was so colorful and catchy. But when I received it, the stones were nothing like the one thats on the photo  ( they were more glass-like... I still liked the fact that it was sterling silver and flower shaped. It was very disappointing that one of the stones fell of the ring after 2 month  ( seems like cheap manufacturing. <end>
 B000BQ6Z16  Pugster Groove Band Sterling Silver Gift Ring Fashion Jewelry ||	  Looks Like Crap  Ring looks like crap. I'm sure if items smelled this would smell like crap as well.

 B000BQO0N6  Blue Vintage Runway Dangle Belly Ring ||	  big and heavy--but pretty  This is a very pretty, very ornate belly ring. The blue in the stones is really striking. It is huge and kinda heavy though, and the photos don't show how huge it is. But I like it, even though I only wear it for special occasions. <end>
 B000BQO0RC  Aquamarine Gem Lock and Key Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Not Bad  It was a little bigger than I expected, the lock on the bottom was a little over a cm in length and one cm wide. I like it because it isn't heavy like other charm barbels, it can be worn for a long period of time. The little loop that holds the key onto the lock is closed so you don't have to worry about it snagging, opening and letting the key fall off. The plastic gem is just glued in and there is nothing behind it so it might pop out after a while. Similar quality to what you would find at the mall kiosk but a way better price. <end>
 B000BR11R8  BSN The-Inchshooter Ring ||	  Hoop Ring  I can't even use it. It's actually too small for any of todays rims. The concept is nice but most of the rims today are thicker. This is set to be used on a very old thin type of rim. It's never been used and I'm very disapointed in it. <end>  Great product  This basketball ring is great. My son uses it everyday. It has really improved his shooting. He loves it so much. Thank you! <end>  did not like it  did not like it send t back its not the ring its dilettante to gees what its for do not recommend this item <end>
 B000BR36AI  Accented Dangle Larimar Earrings ||	  Present for Porky  These Larimar earrings were a present for my wife on our 45th wedding anniversary. They needed to match a Larimar necklace and ring that she already had. The earrings are beautiful and the match turned out better than I could have expected. Importantly, the earrings that we received are exactly as they were represented online by Amberplus. More importantly, my wife loved them.Another strong point for the seller was the customer service they provided. There were some problems with delivery. These were totally my fault since I provided the wrong shipping address. However, Amberplus customer service went above and beyond the call of duty to solve the problem and get the earrings to their correct address. <end>
 B000BRHB90  Geometric Pattern Beaded Wood Boho Stretch Bracelet ||	  too small  this bracelet is too small to ware, looks like made for little girl. From the image showed on website, we couldn't tell. <end>
 B000BRKUEI  Glow in the Dark LifeSaver tongue ring Green ||	  can't complain!  I ordered the green lifesaver tongue ring. When it arrived, I noticed that it's not as green as I had expected it to be, but is instead a yellow/green, but I'm not particular, so it was not an issue for me. It may be better to take out the "life saver" before going to bed, because, personally, my tongue swells a little when I'm sleeping, so it has occasionally caused discomfort upon waking up. <end>
 B000BRMYLA  Traditional Woven Sterling Silver Band ||	  Classy ring  This is a classy looking ring that could be dressed up or down. It's absolutely beautiful. It arrived on the first estimated day. Eve's addition is one of my favorite stores. The products are nice and you have great customer service. It keeps me coming back over and over again <end>
 B000BRQLAA  Extra Long 30" Swirled Green Marble Brass Chain and Black Tassel Necklace ||	  Tassels fell right off!  This is a really pretty necklace- looks just like the picture. Only thing is the first day I wore it, the brass and black tassels were falling out all over the place! I was leaving a trail every where. I barely stroked them because ONE was longer as it had gotten loose, and literally ALL of them fell out. Every single one. So I put them in my pocket and will probably just wear the necklace with out them.I think I could reattach them because it looks like they were just tied in knots, though I'm not sure. Luckily it still looks fine, just isn't the necklace I thought I was getting. <end>
 B000BS1EIS  Oval and Round Vintage Drop With Clear CZ Earring ||	  gorgeous earrings for a great price  I wear these casually as well as for dress up. I love them! They look real and are not too fancy for everyday wear. They are classy enough to seem as though the average person could actually afford these "diamond" earrings - not too much bling. They hang nicely and are very pretty. <end>
 B000BSGIR0  Smooth Sterling & Sleeping Beauty Turquoise Ring ||	  Beautiful ring!  I bought this ring because a friend of mine got a simialar ring as a Christmas gift and I loved it. It is well crafted and a good deal for the money. You will get many compliments for this ring. <end>
 B000BSL3LQ  Comedy Tragedy Gold Charm - M2441 ||	  Just beautiful!  I purchased this charm for my daughter, who is in musical theatre at her high school. It is a very nice size, and she wears it often. She receives many compliments on it. It has some substance to it, and it is made well. When put on a pretty chain, it looks beautiful. The bezel is large enough to fit a larger chain through it. I looked around for quite a while to find a pretty comedy/tragedy charm, and found this one to be the most attractive one. <end>
 B000BSWBG2  Crystalline Jeweled Martini Gem Olive Dangle Belly Ring ||	  CLASSY AND SEXY  This belly ring looks very cute when worn. It dangles at a very nice length and doesn't bounce around too much like some belly rings do. Very nice buy. <end>
 B000BSY5AW  No Parking Sign Logo Belly Button Ring ||	  cute  It cute and i have no problems with it. Though i didn't exspect that it would blend in so much with my very fair skin <end>
 B000BSY5O8  Top Dangle Pink Female Symbol Acrylic Multi-Layered Belly Ring ||	  Weird  This is my own fault but I didn't realize the female symbol is upside down so it doesn't make much sense when I wear it. Not sure if people will even understand what it's supposed to be or they might think it's an ankh which is obviously not what I was going for.It's not as 3d looking in real life either. When you are wearing it and view it from straight on you can only see the light pink which is more opaque than the image made me think it would be.Other than that the quality is what you would expect for cheap jewelry. Not a piece I would suggest wearing for more than a day straight for fear of skin irritation. I don't hate it but I don't love it like I was hoping I would. <end>
 B000BT2AGW  3 Diamond "Snow Man" Earrings 1/4 ct. in 14K White Gold ||	  snowman earrings  These earrings are for a baby - they're so tiny. I erred in buying these for myself, but had a relative's child to give them to. <end>
 B000BT3OF8  14K Yellow Gold 3/8 ct. Diamond Ring Guard ||	  Beautiful!!!  This ring guard is gorgeous! I had to have it adkusted as the width of my ring was too wide. My jeweler was able to make it fit beauticully. I lost one of the stones riding on the trolley in Sam Francisco and I have written the company to see if I could get it replaced there or purchace a replacement diamond.14K Yellow Gold 3/8 ct. Diamond Ring Guard by Katarina <end>
 B000BT5KVE  10K Yellow Gold 1/5 ct. Diamond Cross Ring ||	  Diamond Cross  I Love This Ring and wear it everyday....in fact I haven't taken it off and it's been over a year now. Still looks great and holding up very well. <end>
 B000BT97XQ  10mm Ball Sterling Silver Leverback 1.5" Long Drop Earrings ||	  Cute earrings but too short  I really love these earrings. They're silver, they're leverbacks (so you won't lose them), and they are cute! The only problem is that these earrings are definitely NOT 1.5&#34; long. They are maybe .5&#34; to .75&#34; long. If you have short hair, they would be wonderful, but with my mid-length hair, you simply can't see them. It's kind of disappointing... <end>  Lovely earrings  The arrived quickly and they are just darling. The leverback style is perfect and it makes the item so much more desireable. I was very happy with my purchase. <end>  exactly as pictured and described  The earrings arrived promptly, in perfect condition and exactly as described. The pricing is very reasonable and everything I have received has been very good quality. Packaging is fine. For gift giving I would transfer into a velvet box or something for better presentation but for myself I am very happy not to be paying for a fancy box that would be thrown away or into a drawer. <end>  Sterling silver ?  I did not like the quality/style of the earrings, nor the packaging it came in. Plus, I did not get any resolution from the company when I complained way before this and another review were posted. <end>
 B000BTDJY4  Tourmaline Wellness Bracelet-Sleeping Person ||	  Very nice bracelet!  My husband wanted to get me something for our 38th anniversary. He looked up the "modern" legend of presents and tourmaline was for 38th. We got on line together and searched for tourmaline and found this bracelet on Amazon.com. It looked nice and the price was right so we ordered it. The bracelet came promptly and is VERY NICE. Actually it was better than I expected - the stones are a nice size and they're multi-colored, i.e., white, mauve, olive, brown, black, etc. The stones are small enough where it's not gaudy and I plan on it being an everyday bracelet. The fact that it is a wellness bracelet helps - I have trouble sleeping so I got the sleeping person. Don't know if that helps, but maybe... I would definitely order this product again and recommend it. It fits my wrist nicely. <end>
 B000BTE3QC  Sterling Silver Clear Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Prettier than the picture!!  The best seller for the best in Swarovski crystal earrings. Always fast shipping. <end>
 B000BTED2G  Avon Extaordinary Vine Anklet ||	  Ankle  I liked the item very much, but was too big for mine ankle. Gave it to my GrandDaughter <end>
 B000BTIP16  Handmade Indian Fashion Jewelry Sterling Silver Earrings 1.75 Inches ||	  Not nice, not right... just wrong  At first when i saw this item I thought it would be nice for a fun family filled night together out in the meadow. Then when I put them on they started squirted pee out on my twin daughters. It got in their eyes and I had to rush them to the hobo convention to recieve some medicine. Then on our way home the earings squirted out poop onto my husband and got on his foot. At first he didn't notice, so after a while he had a muscle spasm and got stuck with it. So we were going 155 mph in our brand new ferrari. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF TERD. IT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE PAINFUL AND STINKY. <end>
 B000BTK42E  X - 8.5", 2Parent/2Child Loving Family Vermeil Toggle Bracelet ||	  Parent/Child Necklace Gold  I ordered this for my wife for her 40th birthday. We adopted our two precious sons this past June and she wanted this very much. She was delighted with the necklace and the quality and was thrilled that it was in the gold. The seller was prompt in shipping and gave excellent service. <end>  Great Christmas Gift  My sister enjoyed it a lot and it held up to her two kids. On the day I gave it to her, she tried to fix the ironing bored and caught it in one of the holes. The toggle came a little loose but was fixable and the gold did not flake off. Great quality... could have done without the certificate of family (barf)! <end>
 B000BUBMUQ  10K Gold Genuine Tanzanite Heart Pendant Necklace ||	  Christmas Gift  It was a pleasure doing business with you. Not only did I get exactly what I wanted (and you displayed), but I got it in the time frame promised - with plenty of time for Christmas.I will definitely be doing business with you again. <end>  Great!  This is indeed a good item! I got this for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day, and it was a little smaller than I had hoped for but nevertheless, it was petite just like she is! It looks very cute on her, thanks Amazon!Five Stars! <end>
 B000BUHC0U  Two Tone Baguette Cut Ladies Diamond Wedding Band ||	  ladies diamond wedding band  Looks great in picture but not as brillant in real life(seems a lot smaller), fit perfectly, but did not come in size that was supposed to, but that was ok because I did not have to resize it. I personally, now thinking back it, was way over price but I am very happy with the ring itself. It seems good quality but I want to get it appraised to be sure. Nice service from company and prompt delievery. A happy customer overall with this particular ring that we recieved. <end>
 B000BUIE7U  Sterling Silver Red Garnet Wide Armor Band Ring Size 6(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  Garnet ring  This ring is pretty which is why I bought it, but the the band metal is so thin it uncomfortable to wear. It cuts in between my fingers making it painful to wear. <end>  Gift - well liked she said  I wanted a ring for a January child and this was a successful choice. Nice weight and craftsmanship. <end>
 B000BULUHG  6mm Italian Sterling Silver San Marco 7" Chain Bracelet ||	  San Marco SS Bracelet  I receive this bracelet in a timely fashion, and was very pleased with the look. It is exactly what I wanted for an affordable price! Great Buy ! <end>  Terrible Cheap-Looking Little Thing  I have to completely and utterly disagree with the one other review of this bracelet. I bought it for my sister as a sort of last minute birthday present since it was pretty affordable. Even though this is a cheap piece of jewelry, it looks MUCH cheaper than its ~$20.00 price tag. You could probably get this for a quarter out of a bubblegum machine. It looks plastic, feels plastic, probably is plastic, even though "ITALY" is engraved on the clasp. Please, please, don't buy this bracelet if you don't want to waste your money. But if you're looking for a plastic-looking piece of jewelry, this is perfect for you. <end>
 B000BUMWNW  14k White Gold 18 Inch X 1.3 mm Foxtail Chain Necklace - O Ring Clasp - JewelryWeb ||	  18" 14k White Gold Foxtail Chain  I only have one thing to say....Love it. I wish I could afford another one and one with a bit more weight to it, but for the pendant I have it's perfect. Fast shipping, excellent communication. Thank you so much!! <end>
 B000BUO26C  Sterling Silver Black Crystal Bracelet 7.5 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Bargain hunter at Amazon  This arrived in great condition and is exactly as pictured! I love it and wear it often. Goes with everything. <end>

 B000BUPY82  Sterling Silver 4mm Green Tube Jade Gemstone 7 inch Bracelet with Secure Latch Clasp ||	  Misadvertised  The bracelet is not 8" and it does not look like the picture that is shown. Those looking for an 8" bracelet beware - I measured it and it is 7". <end>
 B000BUQPS0  Elegant Sterling Silver Fancy CZ Bow Necklace ||	  Simple, yet Elegant  I really enjoy the necklace that was sent to me. It is fresh, sexy and elegant all rolled into one. I hope it lasts a long time and does not tarnish. <end>
 B000BUQQT8  Sterling Silver & CZ Aquarius Zodiac Pendant ||	  Eve's Addiction Jewelry  I am very disappointed with this necklace. I bought the zodiac necklace for my niece and I received the necklace with a stone missing. I also had purchased a Lucky Horse Shoe Charm and the stone fell out of it as well. I am very reluctant to purchase anything else from this company. <end>
 B000BUR5Q6  Yellow Dice Curved Banana Eyebrow Ring ||	  Great product, value and service!  I ordered this eyebrow ring for myself, and I love it! I had been looking for a dice eyebrow ring for a long time, and was happy to find this one. I loved the way it looked online, and for the price they were offering it for, I had to buy it. I am very pleased with my purchase.Based on the picture, I thought that the dice on the ends would be a bit larger than what they actually were, so I was slightly disappointed to find that they were quite small. However, once I actually put the jewelry in, I found that they were actually the perfect size; anything bigger would have just looked obnoxious. The yellow was also a little darker/more cloudy than what was pictured here, but again, I think it ended up being for the better. With the size of the dice, anything lighter probably wouldn't have showed up very well against my skin.This is a great value for what you get, too; good quality body jewelry can be expensive, and this is great quality at a really cheap price. Of course, there's shipping costs, but if you're ordering multiple items at once, even that doesn't amount to much. I also received this in a very timely matter, and when I had a problem with my order, the seller was quick to fix it for me.I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Would definitely recommend both the product and the seller! <end>
 B000BURG06  10k Yellow Gold 16 Inch X 1.5 mm Singapore Chain Necklace - JewelryWeb ||	  Gold necklace  So far so good. Shipping was on time. It glitters in the light almost making it look like a larger sized necklace. <end>
 B000BUUPEA  Crystalline GEM WINGED Eyebrow Ring ||	  Tacky barbell  This barbell looks beautiful on amazon but, once you receive it? You might not be too happy. The ball is clear but, you can see the bar through the ball, the wings look terrible and the gem is too large for something this small. <end>
 B000BUUPEU  Passion Pink Double Gem Cone Eyebrow Ring ||	  Decent Quality Metal Piercing Jewelry  There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points - End stays screwed on relatively well- Nice quality; not easily damaged- Does not irritate or inflame piercing- Not uncomfortable to wear- Jewels are well-set; will not fall out <end>
 B000BUUPF4  Fleur Di Lis Barbell Eyebrow Ring ||	  Neutral  I had a new piercing and tried to switch the hoop to this one. I can say it didnt work very well. Also, I dont know if it is my piercing or the ring but the space between the holes for the fleur di lis was not big enough. I had to break off one of the eyes and bend the top one out for it to fit. It resulted in the top eye breaking so I now have no charm. Which is a shame because I really loved this ring. So, to sum it up. If you have a new piecing (not healed all the way), dont get this ring. If you have a large amount of skin pieced on your eyebrow, dont get this ring. Also, the charm has nickel in it. I broke out and my piercing became infected. <end>
 B000BUV0SU  Elegant Silver and CZ Snowflake Pendant ||	  I haven't taken it off since I got it  It is so cute! Cheap as hell, sure, but also elegant, delicate ,and charming. <end>  Pretty  The CZ sparkle in the sun and the tendrils are minimal but elegant. The pendant is not flimsy and a unique alternative to the traditional snowflake design. <end>  Lovely necklace  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother. It was absolutely lovely. The price was right, the shipping was fast. Will definitely continue doing business with this company. My only complaint is that the chain was a little tangled when we opened it, but that was easy to fix. Very pretty piece of jewelry. <end>  Darling pendant  Adorable little pendant. The chain was kind of cheap, so I swapped it out with a better one of my own. I've gotten several compliments on the pendant, it's very pretty and a little bit different from the norm. My favorite winter accessory now! <end>  Snowflake pendant necklace  I love this necklace and have had many compliments on it. I have always wanted a snowflake pendant and I am so happy with this one. <end>  Pretty, even Beautiful, but not gorgeous.  The only thing lacking from the petite little sterling silver necklace is sparkle, the CZ's dont seem to sparkle at all, they just look like cut glass. Overall, after having seen the Real deal at [...]**, where the real thing is [...] in 10k white gold and real diamonds, this is a really great alternative, and you cant beat the price. My wife was thrilled with this, and at first glace thought I got her the [...] one, she almost cried. Thanks!**Side note, it seems Ice.com no longer sells the White Gold & Diamonds version of this, which is a shame =( <end>  More beautiful than I expected!  I always wanted a snowflake pendant and asked for this for Christmas. It is much better quality for the money than I expected. The snowflake is larger than I thought it would be, which is a good thing! The chain is attractive, though it seems shorter than I expected- but it works. Everyone actually thought the CZs were real diamonds! It is beautiful and unique. <end>  perfect size  This item is wonderful and great price on two. I gave one to my 18 yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it too! Fast delivery and unique and beautiful packaging. <end>  Fun Winter Piece  A very pretty necklace, have worn it only a few times and always get compliments. <end>

 B000BVN18Q  Southwest Spirit Jewelry Polishing Cloths - Package of 3 ||	  Good for quick polishing  I'm happy with these cloths. I didn't experience any residue on my fingers like some other reviewers mentioned, and they generally work well. I'd prefer it if they lasted a bit longer but that seems to be the nature of this product. I would definitely recommend. <end>  Love Them  These work better than any other silver polishing cloth I've used. Easy, no mess and the silver shines. <end>  Powerful  I have a white gold rolex and noticed that it just didn't shine like it had used to. I've used the jewlry solution cleaners from the store and even went and purchased a small ultrasonic jewelry cleaning machine. None of these really cleaned my watch. I just used the cloth last night and it really works. My watch looks like it is completely new... Amazing <end>  Great for keeping silver clean  I use Sunshine cloths on all of my sterling silver jewelry and my 14K gold as well. As a jewelry designer, these are a necessity. <end>  Excellent jewelry cleaning cloth!  Does an excellent job of cleaning my silver & gold, without alot of effort! Gr8t purchase! <end>  Shine shine shine  Wear gloves while polishing because it is messy and blackens the fingers, also, finally polish with a clean cloth before wearing your jewelry to avoid getting the polishing compound on your skin. Afterwards, your pieces are almost as bright as sunshine. <end>  works great  These are really nice to polishing silver jewelry. They work well and it's nice to have a couple of back-ups for the tough jobs. As other reviewers have mentioned, they are impregnated with a cleaning agent, so they can't be washed. But, even if they appear black from removing tarnish from jewelry, they still work. <end>  Wonderful for polishing stainless steel  These cloths are the best I've found for polishing my stainless steel watch. I've tried other cleaning cloths that really haven't compared to how well these clean the watch. Brings the shine and color back to new! <end>  Quick clean for silver jewelry  This is good, no fuss product for shining silver jewelry. I've purchased once before and I was totally satisfied by the ease of tarnish removal. The photo indicated the product would arrive in a tube (they did the first time I ordered). They arrived in a zip lock bag the second time. I don't care how they are packaged as long as I can shine up my necklaces, pins and rings. I don't wear gold so I cannot comment on the effectiveness. <end>  Works well on platinum, palladium and silver.  Most of my jewelry is platinum, palladium or silver and these cloths work very well my rings and necklaces. I actually cut each cloth into smaller squares and use them. This way it takes longer to ruin an entire cloth. These work well on my gold-filled brass jewelry items as well. <end>  Quick, Easy & Effective  These cloths are amazing! They make jewelry cleaning quick and easy. Three to a pack delivered to your door is a bargain. True, there are some jobs better done with liquid, ultrasonic or other methods, but these pre-treated cloths work like a charm for quickly shining up pendants, chains and rings, especially sterling silver. <end>  my jewelry looks so alive  ')  SO AWESOME. wow. i had a bunch of silver jewellery i never wore because it was so dirty and icky and EW but once i polished them with one of the trios, , they looked great. i even used it on some cheap-o but still very cute necklace i got an accessory store (non-silver) and it even cleaned that too! incredible. definitely buy, it's also a much better price than those other ones because you get three and they're about the size of a kleenex or maybe a little bigger. <end>  Awesome cloth for jewelry cleaning!!!  I was purchasing a sterling/gem pendant at a little boutique when the clerk pulled out one of these cloths and polished the pendant. It was amazing how it cleaned!! So I purchased one and went thru it cleaning all of my jewelry. So I decided to get some additional ones to share with my daughter. I do not know what is on the material but it is quick and easy! Your hands can get dirty but wash easily with soap and water. From my understanding, you cannot wash the cloths but they clean alot of jewelry!!!! <end>  Love this product!  I am 100% satisfied with the Sunshine Jewelry Cleaning Cloths. They are easy to use, a generous size, and quickly and easily take every bit of tarnish off of the silver plated beads I use in jewelry making. Also, I needed these in a bit of a hurry, so was pleased that they were shipped and delivered so quickly. I will definitely continue ordering this product! <end>  Works great  These silver cleaning cloths work great. Not the cheapest way to clean your jewelry -- but probably the easiest and best. <end>  Super cloths  Cleaning gold earrings, bracelets has never been easier. My original cloth is over 5 years old and just starting to show wear.Since I only needed one cloth to replace it, I've given the other two to friends. <end>  Best Option for Silver Jewelry  These cloths work great on my silver jewelry, and won't damage the stones the way the dip-type products will. It's also a less messy option to the silver pastes, although some tarnish usually does transfer to my hands. All in all though, this is the best product I have found for keeping my silver jewelry sparkling. <end>  An item I purchased because of the rave reviews...ALAS  I bought these cloths based on the customer reviews and truly wished to use them to clean some silver jewellery and a repouss&eacute; silver teapot. I found the cloths extremely stiff, and in fact abandoned cleaning a chain necklace as the cloth did not soften and I was afraid the necklace would break. I then used the cloth to clean a very tarnished repouss&eacute; tea pot and it did get the pot pretty clean, but the effort to work that cloth because it was stiff (until it turned black from removing the tarnish), was just way too much elbow grease for me. I actually had to perch myself above the teapot and use pretty strong movements to mould the cloth around the curves of the pot. I think the principle of a cloth cleaner is a lot simpler than liquid polish, but this cloth was just unmalleable for cleaning silver jewelery and needed too much stregth to clean the teapot. Perhaps the cloths were faulty. I have seen a friend who is a jeweler use a smaller cloth. I will have to investigate about other brand options. After the rave reviews, I was truly disappointed with this product. <end>  Excellent item, but one warning  I purchased a single sunshine cloth, but I made a discovery while using it that I feel is important to repeat on other versions of the same item that Amazon sells. While this is excellent for cleaning solid-medal jewelry, silverware, etc., be VERY careful if you have (or think you might have) an item that's only plated. I have a large quantity of vermeil jewelry (24k gold plated over sterling silver) and a lot of it slowly tarnished over the years. The tarnish actually came through the gold. I was able to use one of the jewelry dipping solutions on most of those pieces, but the dip warned me away from using it on pieces with enamel or pearls. I bought the cloth to use with such pieces -- in addition to sterling items with enameling and pearls -- but have discovered that if I use it on tarnished vermeil, it rubs the gold right off. Fortunately it did this on the back of a piece so nothing was destroyed, but since there's no mention of this risk anywhere in the product information, I wanted to say something. Otherwise, the cloth is excellent and worth using. Just be aware that you can't use it for everything and you'll need something else for delicate plated pieces. <end>  Works well  They did a great job of cleaning jewelry. They are a little messy and I would suggest wearing rubber gloves. My hands felt weird when I finished cleaning. I couldn't even wash the film off of them. <end>  do not wash these cloths  I used these cloths to clean a lot of old jewelry, including some that was extremely tarnished, and I found them to be extremely effective. My hands did get covered with tarnish as others have mentioned, but it washed off easily. More importantly, the tarnish just kept coming off onto the cloth.I wish I had known that you are not supposed to wash the cloth itself. With all the black tarnish that gets transferred to the cloths, I was rinsing the cloth out with water after I used it. The tarnish came off, but I guess the cleaning compound did too, because they became less effective after several rinsings. The cloths should come with instructions for their use and care. I have since read on the internet that silver polishing cloths should not be washed - however, I could not find any care instructions that addressed these specific "sunshine" brand cloths. <end>  Best Tarnish Removal Method for Jewelry I Have Found!  [ASIN B000BVN18Q Trio of Sunshine Jewelry and More Cleaning Cloths]-By Carolyn Pollack These area absolutely the very best tarnish removal method for jewelry I have found. They easily removed the tarnish from my sterling silver, copper and brass jewelry safely. Whatever is on these cloths to help remove the tarnish is not harsh like those liquid chemical tarnish removers. Neither are they abrasive like the sheets of tarnish remover for copper/brass. No scratching or pitting of the metals. Just shiny and tarnish free jewelry after wiping with these cloths. It was so easy. I am extremely impressed and highly recommend these polishing cloths to remove dirt and tarnish from sterling silver, copper and brass jewelry. <end>  Very good item  These are very good, cleans our jewelry and buffs them very good. You get plenty of them for the money. I will buy more of these for sure. <end>  Best cleaning cloths I've ever used.  The jewelry cloths I've used in the past felt dryer than these. They worked well, but these work outstandingly! So well that they removed so much crud from one piece of jewelry it almost filled the whole cloth! I'm going to order more. If you have some jewelry ( esp. silver) that has gemstones or that you would rather not trust to the chemicals or ultrasonic cleaners, these cloths are the best by far, just be prepared to order twice as many as you think you'll need because these are going to remove more tarnish than you thought possible.

He is very detailed and if you look close, has personality.Pierce This 2 really came thru for me.

 B000BWCVKO  African Trade Bead With Button Clasp Bracelet - Last One Ever ||	  Glad I Misplaced this item!  I had ordered this bracelet as a gift for a coworker in the school I work in. Apparently this bracelet had come in time for the holidays but, my daughter mixed it in with family gifts waiting to be wrapped. I thought this bracelet was lost in the mail......so, I had to go out and purchase another gift for my friend. This all worked out to be good for me though, because, when I located it in the relatives section of my shopping gifts low and behold----There it was! I was so excited because this bracelet turned out to be a gift to me from me! I love it along with its earthy color tones. It is very nicely made, and I am thinking about ordering another one soon for another friend as a birthday present. <end>

 B000BX0GNM  Hoop Earrings - Kenyan Heishi and Turquoise Beads ||	  nice with some reservations  These are nice-looking earrings of unique design, but they are a bit flimsy, especially the wire hoops. Although they may be "gold plated," they still leave my ears a bit sore at the end of the day -- I'm sensitive enough that gold, silver, or hypoallergenic hoops are the only things I can wear for several hours with complete comfort. Given the price once postage is added, they are quite a bit more expensive than other earrings I've bought on amazon that I like better. Still, I'll keep them as I like the design and they do look nice on. <end>
 B000BX0RVI  Sterling Silver Victorian Style Open Cross Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10) ||	  So pretty!  Runs true to size, and mine is pretty close to picture in appearance. I wear it almost everyday! It's a really pretty ring! <end>  love it.  i had a smaller cross ring and it got to where it wouldnt fit my finger anymore so i had to have a new one and i love this one. fantastic buy. <end>  Exactly what I wanted  This ring is absolutely gorgeous. The price was under $20, it's pure sterling silver, the filigreed cross is beautiful and the band isn't just a plain one.Am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Sister Loved It  This was a gift and shipped directly to my sister. She said it well made and beautiful, she loved it ! <end>  smaller then i thought  if this were for me i would have rated it a 3 but because the person i got it for still loved it even though it was smaller then expected, i still gave it a 4. and we ordered an 8 which is her normal size but it was very very snug. <end>  Masterroo  I bought this ring for my girlfriend as a promise ring. She absolutely loves it and wears it everyday. Excellent quality, packaging, and very fast delivery. <end>  Love this ring  This is so pretty a ring, have had quite a few compliments from friends and strangers. Looks delicate yet is strong. <end>  LOVE THIS RING!  I was not sure what to expect when I purchased this ring. I am a very active female. This ring is worn constantly by me. It has endured countless adventures, and has maintained well. Thank you seller! <end>  nice product  Pretty, but not as substantial as I thought it would be...I had worn a ring for a long time on my left hand and needed to replace the one I had. Fit perfectly and will purchase from seller again. <end>  gf loves it  my girlfriend especially enjoys this ring because of the thickness of the ring band. In the past she has had similar rings but has always been frustrated by the flimsy ring band, but this ring has a nice solid band. <end>  this item is pretty  i do like this item it is just not what i expected the cross is a little bigger than what it looks but i do like it very much and wear it almost everyday <end>  under-impressed  Sterling Silver Victorian Style Open Cross Ring Size 9(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9)The Picture does not represent the actual ring.. the ring is quite a bit thinner and is very bendable.. my ring even had some tarnish on it... the cross and details on my ring are not straight and uneven if you look closely... its also a lot flatter than the picture portrays, especially the middle of the cross.. its cute and cheap so I kept it.. most people dont notice at first glance.. so I accepted it this way, but not my favorite like I thought it would be.. But the sender was fast and I got it sooner than I expected. <end>  Hmm... So-so.  Very small, the cross I mean. Does NOT look like what is on the picture. EX  It's not dark, and the entire cross is flat. However, it is still cute. Just disappointed it doesn't look like what was promised on the picture. The sellers though, work and answer very quickly. <end>  gothic ring  This ring is really cute. (If you like the Gothic look, then it'll go well with your look, but its not only for a Gothic look too.) The cross itself is a little bit smaller then the picture shown, I'm guessing about 1 inch bigger, but the ring is worth it. When purchased, this ring it comes with a little cute black velvet pouch. Also, you can't really find cross ring with this design in stores for a costume jewelry. The metal itself is pretty good, it won't rust too easily or bend that easily. <end>  Victorian Style Cross Ring  This is a nice ring. It basically looks like the photo, though I thought it was going to be a little thicker over all. But it is still very nice looking and I have been getting compliments on it. My only fear is that with the way it lays on my finger, it sometimes gets caught on things, like when I reach into a bag to get something it gets stuck on something in the bag; and I'm afraid that one day it will snap off. It seems sturdy enough and thick enough to handle it, but only time will tell. Over all it is a nice product and I would buy it again if I had the choice. <end>  Beautiful!!  This ring is absolutely stunning in person. I was honestly a little worried that because the price was so affordable, that the ring wouldn't look that great in person. But I was very wrong, and it looks beautiful! Very simple, yet, elegant ring for every day wear. Also you could wear this with any type of outfit and still goes well. Oh one other thing... I was worried about the top and bottom of the cross catching on things. The way the ring fits, the top and bottom part of the cross are snug to the finger (but not so snug that it's uncomfortable!), and I never have a problem with it getting caught on anything...just an f.y.i.  ) <end>  Buy it!  Keeps it's luster. Quite nice. I wear it often. Rich looking on the finger. Quite detailed. Love it. <end>  LOVE STERLING SILVER Rings N Things  I LOVE Sterling Silver Jewelry. I fell in LOVE with this ring when I first saw it. And the price was something that I could definitely afford, even with shipping. I Believe In GOD, and this ring was just what I was looking for to show my faith. I carry HIM in my heart everyday, so why not wear this symbol of CHRIST on my finger, too? I was a little disappointed when it came in, though. While it was the size I ordered, it was a tad bit tight. I can't wear it on the finger I ordered it for, but I still wear it. It's Beautiful and antique looking. <end>  Victorian Cross Ring  Really like the ring. It's not as thick as I thought it would be but still sturdy. The sizes seem to run small. I ordered a 10 and it fits like a 9. But overall I love it and would definitely recommend it. <end>  Very Nice  I chose this ring in a size 4 to fit on my pinky finger. It looks good and feels good. <end>  A Testament of My Faith.  This is a great little ring for the price, it was much nicer than I expected it to be. Others have told me how nice they think it is & ask where I got it. I am going to order 2 more for gifts. <end>  cute  came quick, great price, very cute and even prettier in person, good quality item, was gift and she loved the item <end>
 B000BXUU4M  Italian Charms Laser Nameplate - Jordan ||	  Jordan charm  Product was nice, writting a bit small, but not much can be done about that. Arrived quickly and was a create price. <end>
 B000BY3R3C  Sterling Silver Italian Threader Earrings with Italian Horn drop total length 4 1/2" Long ||	  My wife didnt like them  They didnt have any stop on them to keep them on, and the chain felt funny to her. They just didnt feel right when she wore them <end>
 B000BY5B04  Star nipple shield body jewelry ||	  ok  this was a cute body jewelry. I bought a set awhile ago, but a few months after having them they started to tarnis and look like there was rust on them! <end>  Star nipple jewelery  The jewelery was such great quality and it came in a heat-protected and sealed bag so you know it is new. Excellent store! I would shop there again in a heartbeat! <end>
 B000BY5VG8  Gothic Vampire Bats belly ring ||	  Pay for 3 bats, get one.  I also owned this belly ring for a short few weeks before the bottom two bats fell off. It looks alright with one bat, but I like it better with three. <end>  Bat Belly Button Ring  This belly button ring is cute! My only complaint is that the wings of the dangling bats can be somewhat painful as do most dangling belly button rings. I have owned this piece of jewelry for approx. 1 month now and the two dangling bats have already fallen off. Although this is unfortunate, I kind of like it better with just the one large bat. All in all happy with this present! <end>
 B000BYTGR8  Small Saint Jude Thaddeus Charm ||	  A Charming Purchase  This was a bit of a tongue-and-cheek purchase (St. Jude is the patron saint for lost causes) but it is a beautiful piece for a Catholic guy like me. A little less than the size of a penny, it is more attractive than the ovular charms that usually feature saints. The company even helped me track down the package when UPS made a mistake during its delivery. Wonderful company but even better item! <end>
 B000BYVDRY  Earrings - E367 - Sequin Dangle - Oval ~ Silver Tone ||	  lightweight sparkle  I bought these earrings to add an inexpensive sparkle to an outfit. They worked out perfectly and didn't hurt my ears because they are very light on the ears. <end>
 B000BZ5F5O  Turquoise Dewdrop Earrings ||	  Good but....  I loved the design of these earrings. Turquoise being my favourite gemstone, the earrings were not a flawless blue. Ofcourse, maybe it is untreated turquoise. But they were a kind of blue with brown spots. If it were a good blue as shown in the photo, it would have been a great pair.... <end>  So Lovely  My earings arrived within a few days of order, carefully packaged and included I found easy directions for returning them if I was not satisfied with my purchase. Happily when I opened the package inside the outer conainer I found them to be exactly as they were pictured and I love them.Since my husband is now disabled I'm not able to get out to stores and shop. My computer and people like Amazon have opened a wonderful new avenue for me to do my shopping. Christmas shopping this year was such fun and a breeze..I did it all on the computer..Thanks, Amazon. <end>

The ball design is really pretty and chain is long enough. am really happy with the purchase just wish they are thicker and sturdier even willing to pay more. <end>  Gold Filigree Ball earrings  Beautiful pair of gold earrings of high quality! Delicate look but well made. Fast shipping. I would recommend them to anyone who likes "threaders". <end>
 B000BZMBVA  Sterling Silver Roman Style Armor Band Ring Size 7(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  very nice for the price!  i love these rings!yah. they are a bit thin. but what do you expect for $13? silver is EXPENCESIVE and for the price. these are very cool rings!if you are expectin a TOUGH ring that you can ' STOMP ON' go elsewhere and pay a LOT MORE.yepsean <end>  Really very nice!  I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised to see how nice it is. It doesn't seem too thin or cheap at all, rather a quality well made ring. I'm very happy with this purchase. <end>  Do as the Romans do  Looks freakin' sweet. Too bad my girlfriend stole it!  ( <end>  Sterling Silver Roman Style Armor Band Ring  I love this ring, it looks great on my finger and is totally comfortable to wear. I wish there were more to choose from! <end>
 B000BZMBWE  Sterling Silver Large Black Onyx Inlay Dragon Ring Size 14(Sizes 9,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  Dragon Ring  I bought this ring for my daughter's birthday; my daughter just loves it and all of her friends comment on how great looking it is; this is a very unique high quality ring. Silver Insanity provides great service and expeditious delivery to its customers. <end>
 B000C042U2  Sterling Silver Black Enamel Cross Band Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Sterling silver and black enamel cross ring  Sterling silver and black enamel comes to life in the cross ring as the five crosses on this very stunning ring radiate from my hand. I have had so many comments on the beauty of this ring and the grace that fills one's soul as they admire the beauty of the interactions of the silver, the black and the design of the ring. Many have ask where to purchase the ring so they to can share their inner feelings in an outward way without having to say a work, but allow the ring to speak for them. The silver and black enamel cross ring speaks for its self.Utterly undescibable. <end>
 B000C0MIQM  14kt Yellow Gold Elephant Good Luck Charm Pendant ||	  Beautiful Pendant  After looking at many, many elephant pendants, I decided on this one. It arrived so quickly, and it is beautiful. It looks better in person than on the picture! <end>

 B000C0OH3Y  14Kt White and Rose Gold Pink Butterfly Brooch Pin ||	  lapel pin  Butterfly Pink Sapphire and Diamond Brooch PinThe brooch should have been described as a lapel pin. It is very small in size and hardly noticeable. <end>
 B000C0Z99K  Sterling Silver Clear Crystal Cube Dangling on a Circle Silver Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  very pretty  i recieved these today,and was very supprised at how pretty they are. lots of color, shine, and sparkle.these speaks for themselves <end>  very pretty  I was surprised when I receive these earrings = They look better than I expected - I like the lever-back closing, and while very dainty, they are very pretty, just the right size and very light <end>  Beautiful accessorie for a bargain price.  These earrings look so clear and sparkly. I'm not convinced that they are genuine swarovski crystals because one side of each item does have a very faint coat of gold paint, however I also saw that on some of the jewelry at the actual swarovski store, so that may be how they should be in order to be to make them sparkle as beautifully as they do. I gave these away as a gift and all the recipients were very happy. For the price this is definitely an item worth getting. <end>
 B000C1TNQE  Sterling Silver Tigers Eye Poison Locket Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9) ||	  Beautiful ring  This ring is so beautifully made. The setting is amazing and I have gotten numerous compliments about this ring. It's very shiny and the detail is magnificent. Also, the tiger's eye gemstone is so lustrious. I absolutely love it! Tiger's eye is one of my favorite gemstones. I'm plan on getting another one! I am very happy with this product! <end>
 B000C1TZM6  Moveable Tail Mermaid Sterling Silver Sea Nymph Mermaid Pendant with 19" Black Cord Necklace ||	  Gorgeous pendant!  I purchased this pendant as a gift for my daughter. Not only does my daughter love it and wear it almost every day, I have also borrowed it and worn it a few times and am very tempted to purchase one for myself. This pendant is beautiful.....much prettier than the pictures suggest.....and my daughter receives compliments on it all the time. We have giggled about the mermaids sparkley bits many times! The artist of this piece created a show stopper!! <end>  beautiful but broken  I would have easily given this necklace 5 stars BUT I wore it once and the black silk cord that it's hanging on broke! Broke in a way that's not easily fixed. I do love it though and it's like no necklace I've ever seen before. I get lots of compliments on it. I'm going to purchase a new black cord so I can wear it again. It's not worth sending back just for another cord. <end>  Love it!  I received the Sea Nymph pendant withinn a week and absolutely love it! I get so many compliments when i wear it! I collect mermaids and this is now one of my favorites. <end>  Enchanting Mermaid!  Moveable Sterling Silver Sea Nymph Mermaid Pendant on Black Cord NecklacePretty Necklace, but larger than I expected. It has cz 'nipples' which I thought was interesting. I like it though. Not sure I think it's worth $30 plus shipping that included a cheap velveteen kind of bag. It would have been nice to have a box, considering the price. <end>  Mermaids  Was exactly the gift I needed for a fun loving mermaid collector. Very detailed. Larger than I thought it would be. <end>
 B000C1VV96  Sterling Silver Softball Charm ||	  great gift  I puprchased this charm for my grand daughter who is a great softball player. She loved it. Great quality and very attrative on her pandora bracelet <end>  sterling silver softball charm  Cute little charm that can be worn as a charm on a bracelet or as a nceklace.

 B000C5J59A  Sterling Silver Musical Notes Charm Bracelet ||	  good gift for pre-teen  delicate and simply crafted, was a great gift for my 11 year old. its thin, and the charms are not exactly made from the finest craftsman ship...it still is a good buy for the money and was a great casual gift for a little girl. <end>
 B000C5J5IG  Sterling Silver Charm Bracelet w/ Hearts and Teddy Bears ||	  Fast shipping  I ordered about 10 things from amazon, and this bracelet was the 1st to come, so the shipping was really fast, my wife wants a charm bracelet for christmas, and this works out great as already got charms on it. <end>
 B000C5JQSU  Sterling Silver Charm Filigree Bracelet ||	  Pretty but not sodered  I love the design of this and it shipped fast! Be careful with the o rings, they are not sodered and it pulled apart with just normal wear several days after purchase. I was lucky and heard it hit the floor. It was also disappointing that the little dangling heart has a giant word CHINA stamped on it (makes it look cheap). <end>
 B000C5LNAO  Sterling Silver Charm Bracelet w/ Dangling Musical Notes and Chime Balls ||	  Flimsy  I bought this item a while ago. When I received the package, it's not shiny or polished. It looks dull. The charms are simply too flimsy to be worn for any extended period of time. Overall, it's a major disappointment. <end>  Favourite  A very, very late review on my part. I've had this bracelet for about 5 years now. It was beautiful when I got it, shiny, was exactly what I wanted. There are a few of the links on the charms coming loose now, but after wearing it literally all the time since I bought it, I think it held up very well. I never take it off and this is the first real sign of wear and tear it's shown in five years.Otherwise, this bracelet looks exactly like when I bought it, the shine has never faded, I've never had to have it cleaned, it's never changed colour like some of my other silver pieces have. I'm really hoping I can get this properly repaired, it is a favourite. <end>
 B000C77WJ8  White gold nose ring Star ||	  ive had better...  while its adorable in theory, the design of this ring leaves something to be desired.i got it to replace another screw that i had, thinking that a white-gold star would be much classier than an ex-cz-sporting prong on my nose. when i put it on however, the screw sticks out of my nostril making for a really questionable and tacky silver "booger" situation.i would recommend this screw for someone who is pierced a little closer to the middle of the nose than the edge so more room is left to hide the back of the screw. otherwise consider yourself warned, and please give me credit for starting the whole "ambiguous silver booger" trend. <end>
 B000C7EJCG  Sterling Silver & Peach Aventurine Gallery Bezel Ring ||	  Clearly a step above!  Meticulous and beautiful workmanship. Gorgeous use of all natural semi-precious stones. Made in the American Southwest! Never disappointed with this designer. <end>
 B000C8OQH8  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Pear Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Womens Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Beautiful  I constantly receive compliments on this ring. Everyone thinks it's real. Very sparkly, and doesn't look gigantic on my sz 5 finger. Worth every penny. <end>  Love it!  This is a gorgeous ring! It really looks like the real thing. It was a little larger than I thought it would be but it looks great on my hand. It arrived in the cutest packaging that would be great if giving this as a gift. I will definitely buy from Gem Avenue again. The price was better than anything else I found anywhere. <end>  very nice...  very pretty ring, is so as the photo, is elegant and with very intense brightness. a reference quality I appraise. but that excellent. very recommendable... <end>  GORGEOUS!  I got this as a "part-time" replacement which is identical to my engagment ring, but work in not such safe areas sometimes and always feared being robbed. It is amazingly gorgeous and authentic-looking. I get multiple compliments and the only thing that makes me feel a bit guilty is that I'm not wearing my actual ring. The zirconias look real in every light. I wish it wasn't so pricey though, I'd but them all so that when the rhodium eventually wears off, I could swap it. Try to avoid washing dishes or using strong soaps as this will eventually wear off the rhodium and you know what a pain it is to polish silver  ) <end>
 B000CB8T28  Sterling Silver Bow Earrings with Pearl Drop ||	  Cute Earrings  These earrings are really cute. Only thing to note is that if you have multiple piercings, you can't really wear a second hole earrings if you wear these bow earrings because they're a bit wide. Overall, these were nice. But don't get the matching necklace. The pearl on the necklace DOES NOT match the pearls on these earrings. The shape and color are different. Also, the chain on the necklace is a bit cheesy. <end>  Dainty  I bought these earrings to replace a gold pair I had some years ago. I've been searching for this style for a long time, and everything I'd looked at before was either really cheap looking or way too expensive. These earrings are dainty, and feminine. They're quite pretty. I wear them quite a bit. <end>  Beautiful earrings!  These earrings are beautiful. They are a little smaller than I thought but they are still gorgeous. Very nice details, looks like fine jewelry. <end>  Very nice!  These earrings look phenomenal. They are very small, but in an elegant way. Their shine is fantastic and their sparkle is great as well.These are a great gift and she will think you broke the bank to get them but you didn't have to!Highly recommended as a great gift for her. <end>  Wedding earrings  My daughter was married last June. Her them was polka dots and bows. She wore these earrings on her wedding day. Great quality. Great memories and now are a keepsake. <end>
 B000CBB48Y  Completely Handcrafted - Designer Sterling Silver 9 Gem Top Golden Baltic Amber Ring ||	  Excellent Quality  This ring is beautiful and quality authentic amber. The ring has a solid feel. I have received lots of compliments on it. Price is good because real amber is very expensive. <end>
 B000CBDZYU  Sterling Silver Blue Enamel Swirl CZ Ring ||	  Surprisingly Nice!  I wasn't sure what to expect from this ring, but have been pleasantly suprised thus far.The materials and craftsmanship definitely exceed the price paid for it. It it really does gives the appearance of looking more expensive than it actually is. It is comfortable to wear runs and true-to-size.The enameled design is finely done. From a distance it could look like tiny sapphires. I don't know the technical term, but where CZ is set there is actually a cut out, in the ring, behind the stone, it for maximum sparkle. <end>  Very nice ring!  My husband bought this ring for me for Valentine's Day and it is really pretty. It is comfortable to wear and looks very nice on. My husband said the shipping was really quick. I am very happy with it and would recommend it to others. <end>

I WEAR IT ALL THE TIME ANDDON'T EVEN TAKE IT OFF AT ALL UNLESS I'M TAKING A SHOWER. EVERYONE THAT SEESTHAT I'M WEARING THIS NECKLACE REALLY LIKES IT TOO. THEY ALSO LIKE THE STERLING SILVER INSTEAD OF THE WHITE GOLD, THE WHITE GOLD OVER SILVER, OREVEN THE GOLD OR THE YELLOW GOLD. I WOULD BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN WITHOUTTHINKING TWICE ABOUT IT. THE NECKLACE WAS SHIPPED QUICKLY AND ARRIVED BEFORETHE ESTIMATED DILIVERY DATE. <end>  not what i expected  I bought this to wear with a pendant however the chain would not fit through the bail as it was to thick, i had to send it back but i got a prompt refund! <end>  Very shiny and elegant  Very beautiful necklace. It is much shinier than the picture and it was well crafted. I wear it with most of my pendant now and 16 inch is just perfect for me. <end>
 B000CBKZUC  Genuine Freshwater Pearl Sterling Silver Earrings with Pink, Purple, Blue, and Yellow Shell Feathers ||	  Overall  nice, but colors are much paler than picture  I rec'd these earrings within a week of ordering them. My only complaint is that the individual colors depicted are not reflected in the actual earrings I got. Mine are MUCH paler in color and don't have near the vibrancy shown here. I would have preferred the more vivid colors but other than that, I do like them. They are balanced properly and a little different than what you normally see. I like the combination of different colors in that they will go will several different outfits I have. <end>  More about seller than product  I order these for my mom and they cancelled the order due to not having any. <end>
 B000CBLX8U  X - Sterling & Turquoise Nugget Necklace, Earring & Bracelet Set ||	  Good buy  I wear this set quite often - it is a good basic set, easy to wear. The multiple colors of turquoise match so many of my outfits. <end>

 B000CCUGE6  Genuine Blue Chalcedony Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  beautiful chalcedony earrings  these earrings are a gorgeous piece of jewelry, beautifully designed, the stone is real, though with a bit more faded blue than the vivid blue in the picture, but I like them very much nonetheless. i am happy with this purchase. great price and great silver quality. <end>
 B000CDFHMQ  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 7mm Princess Cut Emerald Cubic Zirconia Post Stud Earrings ||	  Garbage!  Don't waste your money. These earrings are garbage. They don't look like the picture; the stones have no dimension. In fact, they look so flat that when I wore them, someone asked if I was wearing earrings or stickers on my ears! I don't have to worry about that anymore, though, because they BROKE ON THE FIRST DAY I wore them! The stone just fell out of the setting! <end>  Beautiful  Beautiful earrings... Got them for my niece when she was here for Thanksgiving last year. She wore them right away. They are the color as in the picture. There is no difference that was seen. <end>
 B000CDOWUO  Silver Round CZ Halo Vintage Ring ||	  Nice ring, only slightly fake-looking  I bought this ring for myself as a Christmas present, since my hubby doesn't share my taste in jewelry.I wanted a vintage style ring, something a little gaudy, as a right hand ring. I don't wear any CZ, so this is my only piece.The quality is very nice. The band and craftsmanship of the setting are super! I was VERY impressed. I absolutely love everything but the large round stone in the center. The center stone does not look like the pic! I am a little apprehensive about how "fake" it looks. While you should assume that it will look slightly fake due to the size of the CZ, just be prepared for it to look "quite" fake and not exactly the way it looks in the pic. The pic lends you to believe that this stone will be subdued. I don't know how to describe it, but most CZ refracts so much light it looks "colorful" (does that make sense?). This in does just that, which is why I normally don't wear CZ. Again despite that, I am pleased with it.I don't mean to knock it too bad. I am still excited to wear it on a daily basis and anticipate many years of wear with this ring.I should add that I'm (obviously) quite picky about my jewelry. I only wear a few pieces, so I want to make sure what I do wear compliments each other. This one has slightly exceeded my expectations. <end>  Pretty for a right hand cocktail ring  Very pretty and sparkly, but obviously not real. The center CZ stone is very large, and does not look like a diamond. So far, so good, I've had it a month, and have not lost any stones or seen any signs of it falling apart. It's great for a temporary ring or for occaional wear as a cocktail ring with some bling! I love the filigree setting, it's very vintage-looking, and the sterling silver also gives it an antique appearance. It's true to size, it has a very thin band, and is comfortable. Overall, great ring! <end>  beautiful ring!  Purchased this ring for myself and I love it!! It is well made & a decent weight. And for such a large cz stone it does not look especially "fake". I have received many compliments on it. I wore it on my left hand a few times and had 2 people ask me if I had gotten engaged and say "what great taste my fiance has!!" I would definitely recommend this ring for purchase. <end>
 B000CDOWXQ  Sterling Silver Queen of Hearts CZ Enamel Ring ||	  very pretty  the ring fits well, i got a size 5, its very pretty, its a shame for one to 1 star a product they didnt buy, only to be upset they dont make in Amazon size..lol <end>  Larger Sizes needed!  I'd love to buy some of these rings, but my ring finger is a size 10, and my index fingers are size 13s. Can't we see some beautiful jewelry for larger ring sizes? <end>
 B000CDSCHI  Elegant Canary CZ Three Stone Engagement Ring ||	  very pleased  I am very pleased with this ring. It was a lot larger than I had anticipated, but it came quickly and was packaged nicely. I would definitely purchase from this retailer again. <end>
 B000CDT4Z2  AugustinaJewelry Freshwater Cultured Oval Shape 9-10mm White Pearl Pendant with 18K White Gold,16" Sterling Silver 1MM Cable Chain ||	  There's the good, then there's the "eh, okay".  I bought this because I needed a simple, pretty pearl pendant. The pearl is wonderfull, however I am not impressed with the bail (the piece that slides onto the chain). It is not as substantial as I thought it would be, and flips upsidown so the smaller pinched end is on the chain and the larger end is holding the pearl, which looks funny and annoys me. Nor was I impressed with the chain it came with (a bit thin and flimsy). Luckily I have a few extra chains I was able to switch with the first one. But that being said, I get plenty of wonderfull comments when I wear it. <end>
 B000CDUIR0  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Heart Aquamarine Cubic Zirconia Post Back Stud Earrings ||	  Great product  Product is very good and the gems are gorgeous. My sister loved them for her birthday. Would buy more earrings like these from this vendor <end>  A Very Happy Birthday Gift  I purchased these birthstone earrings for one of my best friends. She called me right after she received the gift and told me how lovely they were. She wore them on her birthday so that all her family and friends could admire them. I will most assuredly purchase more of these in the future for others. In fact I might even get a pair for myself! This was a very good buy! Thank you!Theresa Kurtenbach <end>  Great product for a great price!  I was so pleased when I received these earrings! I bought them for my niece (they are her birthstone) and both she and I loved them. They are exactly as the picture shows them. Great coloring to the stone, and the setting of the earring looks nice. I couldn't be more satisfied. <end>  Very pretty  I ordered these as a birthday gift, at the last minute. They arrived in time, and they are actually prettier than I expected. <end>  Aquamarine studs  These little hearts go perfectly with the heart pendant I also purchased from Amazon..they are well made and worth the price.. <end>  Great Value!  These earrings are so pretty in person and look like real gem stones. They arrived quickly and in a pretty gift box just in time for my daughter's best friend's birthday  ) <end>
 B000CDVKTU  Eliza's Antique Design Emerald Cut CZ Engagement Set ||	  LOVEEEE  I just received this beautiful beautiful ring set. It is bigger than appears, but absolutely RAVISHING!!!!! So clear and shiny! Recommend to anyone!! <end>
 B000CDWJ7C  CZ Wedding Rings - Gold Plated Sterling Silver Antique Style CZ Wedding Ring Set ||	  so-so  the ring is beautiful and i've received tons of compliments for it but the gold wore off very quickly. i've only had it for 2 months and half of the gold is gone. <end>  Took a chance and was not disappointed.  These two rings are absolutely beautiful. I found that the gold perfectly matched many of my bright gold pieces. I have received so many compliments I cannot even begin to count them. I have worn it almost daily for about two months and have no complaints. I have not lost any stones or any shine. I typically wear more understated jewelry but decided to take a chance on this after falling in love with the picture. I can wear each alone or together for a bigger impact. I am glad I took the chance. <end>  Wouldn't buy again  I'm sorry to say this ring looks better in the picture than in person. The gold tone is too bright and wore off quickly. It has a light weight to it. <end>
 B000CDYD44  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Teardrop Shaped Pink Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Marcasite Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Perfect Pink Ring  I love this style of ring from Gem Avenue so much that I've purchased it in every color. Marcasite is such a unique stone and makes pieces look very vintage. I've always loved pink and black as colors and feel they go incredibly well together. As I've written before this ring can be worn pointing up or down so it really does give you two looks. The pink is a lovely rose-pink full of color. The ring is very well made and looks like a precious heirloom. Looks like it's worth much more than this incredible low price. <end>  weird sizing  Okay so I got this ring because I thought it looked different to what I usually have. Which it is, I bought one other ring from this company. The only issue I really have is that even though both are the same size the other ring is kinda small and this one is too big. But I didn't want to pay like $4 to get a different size because usually the other size is way too small. But I will say that it does look a lot like the picture, it is light, and a little bigger then what your first thought at looking at the ring maybe when you first get it. Over all its a nice ring for the price and the bright side is the shipping was free and it does not turn your fingers green. <end>  Very nice ring  This ring is almost exactly as it is pictured. It is a very little bit lighter, both the setting and the stone, but it is quite a pretty little ring. I am very satisfied with it and I have had compliments on it already even though I've only had it for a couple of days. I would say if you like the way it looks in the picture then you will like it. I received it quickly, when I was supposed to. Altogether a good purchase experience. <end>  Beautiful ring  I had been looking to purchase a ring for awhile and when I saw this ring I knew I had to have it. It really is a beautiful ring at a great price. If you are thinking about purchasing this ring, you should do it. I liked the ring so much I even bought my sister one (in a different color of course). Beautiful ring, good price! <end>  Beautiful ring for an amazing price  I am so happy with the service, my ring came in a short amount of time and looks as beautiful as it does in the picture. Everytime I wear it, I get compliments on the beauty and the quality of the ring. <end>  Great Buy  I am completely satisfied with the quality and style of this pink marcasite ring. I receive alot of compliments and the price was great. I think Gem stores rates 5 stars and of course the ring does too.. <end>  Quality item - great price  I purchased this ring for my cousin who is a first time mom. I wanted something elegant and classy for her to remember this special time in her life. I chose this ring because it is simple yet unique. Gem avenue has an excellent selection of rings in the sizes I needed, not many places carry rings that are over size 8. We wear 9 or 10 ring sizes and this item is so great because we did not have to get the ring sized. The price was great too and I am very happy with the quality of the ring. <end>
 B000CDZROO  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Heart Blue Sapphire Cubic Zirconia Post Back Stud Earrings ||	  Cute, Cheap, but worth it  These earrings are cute and small, but they are the right size compared to the smaller sizes. I bought several pairs for my girlfriend and she loves them. It is a perfect product for a daughter, teenager, bff or the like. The sizes smaller than the 6-7MM are too small and won't be seen as well as a heart comparatively. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Everything about the order was perfect and on time. Thanks. <end>  Blue Cubic Zirconia Heart Earrings  Nice product... I've worn them everyday since I got them. Its a little hard to tell they are a heart unless you look carefully but overall quality is very nice. <end>
 B000CDZRZS  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Teardrop Shaped Garnet Cubic Zirconia Polish Finished Marcasite Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  Beautiful Ring  I don't really know what to say. It's the size it said it was going to be and looks exactly like it did in the picture. I've gotten several compliments while wearing it. However, the stone is as orange-y as it looks, so beware of the 'garnet' label. Sometimes garnet is more orange than red. <end>  Gorgeous!  I couldnt be happier! I usually LOVE huge rings, but this is an exception! Don't get me wrong; this isn't 'petite' but it isnt massive as well. This ring has such beautiful details, is extremely well made, and you couldnt even tell it was a CZ and not a genunie garnet!The color is a deep red, but so sparkly! A true value for price and quality! Highly recommended! <end>  Awesome!  This ring is not too large but has enough facet and color to give it a good Zing! The price made me a little wary of purchasing it, however the craftsmanship is far above what I could have possibly expected. It is a wonderful ring and the the photos here just don't do it justice <end>  Well made, good price!  Although it delivered in 3 weeks after I ordered, probably because I live in Canada. The ring is beautiful and well made. Plus the good price, I have nothing to complain about! <end>  WOW this ring is so gorgeous.  This ring is so unique looking and really well made. I can't believe the cost, it looks like a priceless heirloom. It is very flattering on the finger, the stone is a nice shade of spicy coral( or orangy red if you will) it's really something. I bought it for a gorgeous earrings and necklace set that did not come with a ring and it works perfectly (I've been looking for a while for a suitable ring to go with the set). The picture is a great indicator but it is even more lovely in person. I can't imagine anyone not loving this ring. Plus the seller is terrific so you can't go wrong. It's available in other colors too! <end>
 B000CE8DU8  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 22 Inch 8-9mm white Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Very Pretty Pearls  I received my order today, and the pearls are very lustrous, white, and consistent in size and shape. They look worth considerably more than they cost. I'm delighted. <end>
 B000CE8HS6  Turquoise Blue Beaded/Sequined Chandelier Earrings ||	  Gorgeous Earrings  These are so beautiful. They are good quality for a great price! Thanks, I love them!! <end>
 B000CE8WK4  Sterling Silver Cube Shaped Pink Crystal and Rectangle Jade 1 inch Long Pendant Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Beautiful!  This is an absolutely beautiful piece! I purchased this with the matching earrings, and I was extremely pleased. For the price, you absolutely can not go wrong! It is larger than I aniticipated and looks stunning on my 16 inch snake chain. <end>
 B000CEAIYC  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 18 Inch 8-9mm white Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Very nice.  These pearls are perfect for a everyday business or casual wear. The length is nice and the pearls appear to be good quality. <end>
 B000CEAJ0K  AugustinaJewelry Double Strand 17-18 Inches 7-8mm Black Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  A Beautiful Gift  A beautiful necklace that I gave my Niece for her birthday & she loved it.All the pearls were perfectly matched with a wonderful luster. <end>  Beautiful necklace  Pearls are notoriously difficult to buy and sell via the web because a pearl's color varies so much, and it's tough to accurately portray color on a screen. This is especially true of black pearls, which can be black, blue, gray, purple, or green.I've tried 4 Augustina black pearl necklaces, and all leaned toward the blue/gray spectrum, with splashes of purple and pink and very little green, my least favorite color. These pearls have a nice shape and luster. The 2-strand 17/18 inch necklaces are nicely graduated and "nest" perfectly. They can also be gently twisted into a 16" twisted pearl necklace. A beautiful, versatile necklace at a great price. <end>
 B000CECNWC  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 18 Inch 6-7mm purple Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Nice pearls  The pearls were nice. In some lights, they don't look as purple as I thought they should. But my wife loved them, which is the ultimate point, I guess. <end>  Great for price and younger girls  I bought this necklace as a holiday gift for a young relative. Perfect length for now and she can wear it later as an adult too (more as a choker). At this price, no one has to worry about something happening to the necklace, giving her some practice. It came with a beautiful blue velvet gift box. Fast shipping too - ordered on Sunday and it came in Tuesday's mail. I ordered regular shipping. <end>
 B000CECNWM  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 22 Inch 6-7mm purple Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Disappointed  I ordered these to wear at my niece's wedding. I was so happy to see the box waiting at my door. Unfortunately, when I opened the jewelry box to look at my new pearls, what I saw was not the purple strand I had ordered and expected, but a sandy/peach strand. It's a beautiful necklace, and I'll probably give them to my mother for Christmas, but I was wanting purple to go with my chosen outfit. <end>
 B000CECNYA  AugustinaJewelry Double Strand 17-18 Inches 6-7mm Purple Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Pleasent  Delivery was quick .. one point I would like to mentioned is, I saw a nice purple color on the amazon but after the delivery of the actual product, the color was more light which was first kind of disappointed me .. but it had good lusture and nice uniform shaped. I presented to my mother in law and she just loved it. thanks. I recommend this product <end>
 B000CECS0O  Violet Moon Multistrand Beaded Necklace ||	  Love it  I was never "big" on big pieces but this was great. It's not too heavy and I got a ton of compliments the frist time I wore it.I also ordered a few other things from the same company which have now become favorites as well. <end>  spiritual..  The violet pendant at the end of this necklace, feels very spiritual to me. I love wearing it.. <end>
 B000CEESUW  AugustinaJewelry Double Strand 17-18 Inches 6-7mm White Oval Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  Product beyond expectations  Their product is better than it appears on the website, excellent quality, outstanding price, and receipt within just a few days. <end>
 B000CEP482  Sterling Silver Cape Cod Style Bangle Bracelet and Earrings Gift Boxed Set (8")(Lengths 6",7",8") ||	  the boxed set from silver insanity is a very good price  when you purchase a Cape Cod bracelet at a Cape Cod jeweler the price is over 100 dollars. The earings are also expensive. the quality of the boxed set from silver insanity does not compare. The bracelet is a much lighter weight and i would not expect the screw ball to have a long life.choose the heavier weight cape cod bracelets if you want to wear this all the time. <end>  The Original  I got this bracelet when I was in Boston visiting for a wedding that I was in. I saw everyone wearing it, it's staple item there. I wanted one so bad so my friend took me to her local jeweler to get one. I feel in love when as soon as I put it on. I wear it everyday. It's tough enough to with stand everyday wear and you will never have to take it off. I even wore it in the wedding and it was nice enough that it didn't stand out it looked like it was suppose to be there. I love it and I would love to have one or two more. I am also going to get one for my daughter. With the screw ball closer I don't have to worry about her taking it off and anything happening to it. <end>  Good quality for the money  I think this is the product set that I just received as a gift. It's obviously not from Eden on Cape Cod but very similiar. It's a very delicate, simple set and looks very nice on. It seems to be of pretty decent quality too. <end>
 B000CESY6G  10kt. Gold, Citrine & Garnet Fashion Ring (Size 8.5) ||	  Beautiful citrine  The citrine stone is absolutely beautiful, the best I've seen. The garnets in the picture are misrepresented. They are about the thickness of a piece of thread....honestly. The gold band is not much thicker...fairly thin. I don't really think the garnets are necessary and would prefer the ring without it. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have the garnets, but instead make the band just a tad wider. <end>
 B000CF5A7Q  Celtic Knotwork Shamrock Pendant (length  16") ||	  Pretty silver shamrock  Pretty sterling silver shamrock necklace. A little more distinctive and different than most shamrock pendants. Can also be used as a charm on a charm bracelet. <end>
 B000CFGU34  Cute Stretchy Blue Sodalite Bracelet ||	  Pretty Bracelet for an Unbeatable Price  This is a nice, versatile, stretchy bracelet that would accommodate most wrist sizes. The stones are very pretty with a blending of blue and white. The combination of the diamond-shaped and round stones creates an interesting design. All in all, this bracelet is a great value for the price. <end>  Great Buy!  I bought 12 of these bracelets for Christmas last year,but ended up keeping half of them! They are well made, strung on heavy elastic- not too tight, around 7 1/2 inches colors are all exactly as pictured. This is one of my favorites! Dark blue- no white to speak of! You will love it! <end>
 B000CFHK2O  Sterling Silver Clear Crystal Anklet 9 9.5 10 inch Ankle Bracelet Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Nice anklet  I purchased this anklet and was able to wear it alot for almost 2 summers before it broke. I received may comments on it and loved it. I would keep it on for days at a time sleeping with it on, wore it in the hot tub, pool etc so when It broke I still felt it had held up well. Going to purchase another one and will take better care of it this time. So glad it is still available for me to buy. <end>  Beautiful!  ASIN B000CFHK2O BDA013 Clear Swarovski Crystal Ankle Bracelet 9" 9.5" 10" Sterling Silver Anklet With Lobster Clasp.This ankle bracelet is even more beautiful than the photo was able to show. Delicate, lots of sparkle, elegant. Will order more for gifts!!!! <end>  Ankles of silver  This was a gift from a someone again.Very beautiful piece of jewlery.Well made and sturdy.Looks great on any skin color <end>  ankle bracelet really great  I love my crystal ankle bracelet, in fact I am wearing it right now! It goes with everything and seems to be very durable! <end>  sparkle  This ankle bracelet is not as dainty as the last one I had but it is going to hold up much better I beleive. It is cute and sparkly. Good value for the money! <end>  Very Sparkly  This ankle bracelet is beautiful and was exactly as described.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because the ring that attaches to the clasp is not as thick as the rest of the anklet. I would hate to have this fall off! <end>  nice birthday gift!  got this for my friend for her birthday and she loved it! it looks good on fair skin rather than tan. <end>  Pretty but cheaply made  This anklet was really pretty. I liked it and wore it all the time. Then, it was made so cheaply that it broke. Not good. I wouldn't recommend it. <end>  very pretty  This is such a pretty, feminine ankle bracelet. It sparkles just enough and is not too bulky. The adjustable size is perfect (with room to spare) for my 9.5 inch ankle. <end>  Very pretty anklet  This is a lovely anklet. The swarovski crystals sparkle and catch the light well & the silver is perfect. It is far prettier than pictured. It's delicate and is versatile - can be worn with very dressy outfits or more casual. The clasp is easy to fasten and it has several links so that you can adjust it exactly to where you want it. This is a great piece to add to your collection and is a fantastic price! I would recommend. <end>  Mother's Day  I ordered three of these anklets. I wanted them for the special people in my life as Mother's Day gifts. Everybody absolutely loved them. They have just enough "bling" without being overly done. They definately catch your eye. <end>  better than I expected  I am very delighted with the ankle bracelet that is very delicate and exquisite I highly recommend it <end>  ankle bracelet  Beautiful! The item makes me feel sexy  ) It is simple yet classy. Would definitely buy from this seller again. Good value for the money. <end>  Classy and of good quality!  This pretty anklet will look great with the Colored Swarovski anklet! I have purchased both and can't wait to wear them in Florida. Order with confidence. <end>  ankle bracelet  I was not very empressed with this item. It was advertised as a 10 inch, but it was very tight and I was nogt able to wear it. <end>  Very, Very SPARKLEY!  I bought this to bling up my ankle for summer short season. It is very sparkley & does not go unnoticed. The sterling pieces between the Swarovski crystals are tubes and it is all held together by heavy clear 'fishing line' type craft cord, and seems sturdy so far. The Swarovski crystals are clear but have the aurora borealis finish, so they flash a rainbow of bright colors. Very pretty anklet! <end>  Beautiful!  THIS IS SO PRETTY AND MORE THAN I EXPECTED. IAM AM THRILLED TO HAVE MADE THE PURCHASE. <end>  sterling silver with swarovski crystals ankle bracelet  This is a beautiful piece of jewelry! Simple yet elegant. I really love this ankle bracelet! <end>  Beautiful Ankle Bracelet  I bought this ankle bracelet as a gift for my granddaughter to celebrate her becoming a young woman. It will fit her for years to come. She absolutely adores it and wears it constantly. I would definitely make this purchase again. In fact I plan to order one for myself. <end>  Best Ankle Bracelet yet!  I am extremely pleased with this beautiful crystal product - it is feminine and dazzling and the perfect size (very roomy). Clasp is nice and large which makes wearing it a breeze to do and un-do quickly. I think this is the most beautiful ankle bracelet I've ever seen. Thanks Amazon - I would love to have a matching wrist bracelet!!!! <end>  Gorgeous jewelry!  I loved the quality of this anklet so much that I went back and purchased a bracelet, earrings and necklace. The pieces are more beautiful than in the picture. I would recommend Gem Avenue to all of my friends. <end>  ankle bracelet  The sterling on the ankle bracelet turned black almost immediately. Unfortunately, I had thrown away all of the shipping info, otherwise I would have returned it. <end>  Sexxy addition to my summer wardrobe!  Loved this anklet as soon as I unpacked it! It fits perfect around my ankle and the crystals catch the light beautifully! It is a little awkward to sleep in since the stones are a little sharp (the only reason it didn't get 5 stars) but it's definitely an eye catcher! <end>  Very pretty and great price.  I love this anklet, I was hoping it was flexible enough to use as a bracelet as well but its not. But thats ok, it will look great this summer!!  ) <end>  Sparkly  The anklet really is very beautiful and priced very well. My only complaint is that the Swarovski crystals, which are NOT as sharp as the ones I incorporate into my hand made jewelry, dig into my ankle. (I only wear jewelry that I do not have to take off, so the anklet is there all the time.)That said, I think in the summertime, this anklet is going to be gorgeous on my bare ankle. Now, though, while I am wearing thick socks and boots, the anklet gets pressed into several parts of my ankle, and at the end of the day, my ankle is bruised. <end>
 B000CFIWTE  Cute Stretchy Fancy Jasper Web Chip Bracelet ||	  WAY TOO HEAVY!  I love stretchy gemstone bracelets but this one is way too heavy and bulky. The price was very reasonable but I honestly will never be wearing it. So rather than waste it I decorated a pillar candle with it. It looks much better on the candle than on the wrist. <end>
 B000CIYGWS  Onyx Vine-Wrapped Ring, 14k Gold ||	  did not last that long  I got this ring for my BD last year. It did look much better then on the picture...but after few days of wearing it the leaf part break off  )It`s hard to find a place to fix it. <end>
 B000CIZ2JY  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Star Black Cubic Zirconia Post Stud Earrings ||	  Luv these earrings!!  I bought these earrings for myself because I love stars. The shipping was extremely fast, the product was everything I expected and more. I am very pleased with what I ordered. I wear them all the time.  o) <end>  Pictures can be decieving  Nice studs. Yet not quite as big as I wanted them to be. However, the benefit of these studs is that people constantly mistake them for Black Diamonds. Who am I to correct them. LOL! <end>  gift for my partner  i bought these for my partner and she loves them!!! the stone is a little bigger than she thought but she still really likes them and wears them like three times a week. nice presentation and quick shipping too! <end>  Very Nice  These items are very nice earrings and shipping was very fast as well GREAT SELLER would buy from again thank you <end>
 B000CJ2USY  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Star Aqua Cubic Zirconia Post Back Stud Earrings ||	  Great Item  Gems are gorgeous and look great. The stars could be shaped a little better though. Still would recommend <end>  Dazzling!  I bought these earrings for my daughter as a gift. I know she is going to love them! They are a good size, not too big & not too little, and sparkly! I would recommend this product. <end>  My wife love it !!!!  Maybe it's not diamonds but my wife really love this tiny gift, that's reminds me that's the real gift doesn't come in a big boxes <end>
 B000CJ33IU  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Star Pink Cubic Zirconia Post Stud Earrings ||	  pink cubic zirconia stud earrings  I am very pleased with my purchase of the pink stud earrings. I have purchased several different colors and am happy with all of them. Gem Avenue has an excellent product at a great price. <end>
 B000CJ7BII  Enhanced Black AAAA Cultured Pearl Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Stud Earrings (LS1B) ||	  Beautiful Earrings  I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift and that person loved them. They are perfect for everyday wear. They were just as seen here. Very Beautiful! <end>  Great Value  These earring were just what I was looking for. Not too big, not too small. Great value for price even with shiiping costs. Moreover, they are beautiful. <end>  Very Happy  This is the second time I have purchased pearl earrings from Dahlia. Both times I have been very pleased. The color and shape is wonderful! They were delivered almost immediatly (which I did not pay additonal for). I am very happy with this product. <end>  Broken after 3 uses.  It broke after just three uses. They are pretty earrings, but not made well. The pearl fell straight off the backing right away. <end>  Lovely earrings, even if they are not truely black!  You must remember, for the price, you are receiving dyed pearls. They cannot be expected to be the deep gunmetal grey of natural black pearls. That being said, these are very lovely. The first pair I received were a bit different in color. No problem.... Dahlia IMMEDIATELY shipped me a different pair and told me that if the second was not to my liking I could return both. THe second pair was very nice, especially for the price. Yes they are not deep grey or black, but they are a VERY well matched, very free from flaws set that look much more expensive than they actually were. They will serve well to dress up a casual outfit or accent after five attire. I am quite pleased with the appearance, quality and service I received! <end>  Not black, but well-built earrings  As some other users have mentioned, these earrings are not really truly black in color.... they have a bit of a chrome finish to them. The shape has harder edges than a classic round pearl which seemed a bit odd at first, but it has kind of grown on me. They are pretty nice earrings are quite sturdily built. Not what I was expecting -- I was just looking for plain round *black* pearl earrings -- but they are pretty nice nonetheless. It's hard to judge from the picture what they look like in real life, so just be sure to check out some reviews before you purchase.  ) <end>  Very pleased!  I bought two pairs of these earrings. One for my daughter and one for me. We both love them. They are a beautiful color and they go with everything. The back is very secure and I am not afraid of them falling off. A great purchase..... <end>  great purchase  great purchase for my girlfriend she loved them! they got here fast! they look great! <end>  Good deal.  One of the most prompt services we have ever experienced. Beautiful enhanced color black pearl stud earrings. Items quite as described. Look lovely. Thank you, Dahlia. <end>  lovely earrings-just what I wanted  I really love my earrings-the color is great and so is the size-I highly recommend these-I had a hard time finding a good black pair of earrings-and then I saw these-and the price is really good, too. If these are for a gift-the packaging is very elegant. Thanks. <end>  SO PRETTY !  I received these and they are very pretty ! Just as pretty as the white ones I bought from this company ! <end>  VERY PRETTY!  I just received these and they are very pretty I am very Happy ! Jessica V. Galveston, Tx. <end>  Cute as a button!  I wanted a pair of pearl studs and these are just the right size. I've gotten a few complements already. Delivery was quick and once again, I'm completely satisfied. <end>  Perfect for what they are  These earrings were very nice and good for everday use. They could be used as part of either casual or formal dress. They are exactly what they appear to be in the picture and will not disappoint. <end>
 B000CJE6WM  Sterling Silver Post Green Jade 8mm Ball Stud Earrings ||	  Great item  I would recommend this item to my friends. Woud buy thes earrins again. Loved it Would buy again. Thank you <end>
 B000CJEV1S  Sterling Silver Purple Jade 8mm Ball Post Stud Earrings ||	  Purple Jade Earrings  I ordered the purple jade earrings to go with a necklace that my boss gave me as a gift. I was so surprised to find these earrings because they are perfect with my new necklace. In fact, I have them on today as I type this review. They are the same color as my necklace and just perfect. I would recommend them to anyone. They came quick too and I didn't have to wait a long time for them. I'm very happy with these earrings. <end>  the girlfriend liked them!  I got these for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day because she likes purple and she loved them. They came in a nice box and everything. Great price also. <end>  Purple Jade Earrings  The earrings are a very good value. The color was a little different than pictured, but I guess that is due to the natural variations in jade. <end>  the way it appears  You get what you see in the picture. My cousin loves purple, and she loved this jewelry as gift. It has very tiny whitish spots which gives a more real look on it. <end>  Earrings are MUCH larger than they appear in picture  These earrings are much larger than most studs and look awkward in the ear because of it. When held next to a pearl earring, for example, they are considerably larger. <end>  A great buy!  These earrings are like Chanel's Black Dress....they will never go out of fashion. They are neat but not too small that they won't be noticable. Can wear for any occasion ...dressy or casual. They are well made and fantastic value. <end>
 B000CKE9FK  Sterling Silver Phoenix Bird Pendant, 1 1/2 inch tall ||	  That's not a phoenix  Anybody familiar with the desert will recognize the road runner in this pendant. I don't know why the description calls it a phoenix. Perhaps the person got confused because they got it from Phoenix, Arizona? <end>
 B000CKE9LO  Sterling Silver Mom and Baby Whale Pendant, 3/4 inch tall ||	  Much smaller than I expected...  I originally bought the charm for myself because I whale watch often and a friend adopted a female whale for me named 'Eden.' I am gently obsessed with doingwhat I can to ensure the survival of the whales - especially Humpbacks. I did love the way the baby whale was suspended from its Mother on the charm,but it was more appropriate for my 5 year old Granddaughter to wear. She also loves whales and her Mother 'adopted' a female for her as well, who also has a baby calf! I would have been willing to spend more money for a larger charm, but you tried very hard to create life like detail, and I was very impressed with your service. SOMEWHERE on the internet there is a LARGE Humpback whale medallion, shown with 2 others, and I have been unable to find it again. Can you help me??? <end>
 B000CKG4Y4  Sterling Silver Rabbit Pendant, 1 inch tall ||	  Thrilled  This was a present for my wife for our 25th (sliver) wedding anniversary, she was thrilled with the rabbit. <end>
 B000CKI7XK  Sterling Silver Sparrow Pendant, 1 1/4 inch tall ||	  Sparrow charm  Nice Charm.I like it on my cram bracelet and it fits well!Thanks for very quick delivery, in les then 2 weeks! <end>
 B000CKK5X0  Sterling Silver Dolphin Pendant, 1 3/8 inch tall ||	  Accurately described and illustrated  It was a well made beautiful and durable Sterling pendant to which I added a quartz point and presented as a gift to a friend. I was very pleased with the item's quality. <end>
 B000CMAGI2  Lapis and pearl link bracelet, 'Sky Song' ||	  Nice piece  Very good handcrafted,shining silver,but the gemstone and pearls are too small, otherwise it could be a masterpiece.made in India , very exotic.bn <end>
 B000CNIGIS  Amazon.com  Marine Deluxe Engraved Ring, 10  Clothing ||	  Very nice  I am very happy with this ring and happy to get one that is made in America. Great Customer Service too! <end>
 B000CO0SZ6  Pearl earrings, 'Sugar Candyfloss' 1" W 2.2" L ||	  Beautiful, just as pictured!  I love these earrings, they look better than the picture... just beautiful, just the right size, I couldn't wait to wear them to work today.You can't tell from the picture, but they are strung together with what looks like clear fishing line. The pearls jingle in my ears when I walk, but I don't mind.The shipping was quite fast considering they came all the way from Thailand. And they came in a cute little keepsake box. I am very pleased with my purchase! <end>
 B000COA734  Sterling Silver Friendship Stackable Bracelet - Peace ||	  Beautiful bracelet!  I got this as a gift and I just love it. I have very small wrists and it's so great that it's adjustable so it will fit me even if it is a cuff. IT's very shiny and pretty. <end>
 B000COSEIE  Pregnant Belly Button Ring with Green UV ends ||	  PREGNANCY GLOW~FRIENDLY GREEN BELLY RING  LOVED IT, ~ EASY TO INSERT, ~ NO IRRITATION... GREAT PRODUCT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY PREGNANT CHICK WHO DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR PIERCING... <end>  Alright  The balls don't really screw on they just kind of sit on the ends. It is so long it gets caught on my clothes. Maybe all pregnancy ones are like that. I am not sure. <end>
 B000COUBHQ  Light Blue Patchwork Belly Button Ring ||	  Cute  This item is a normal belly button ring. I like it's size and i enjoy the blue squares, other colors of this fashion are nice. It seems almost sporty to me. <end>
 B000COUBWG  Pregnant Belly Button Ring With Black Uv Ends ||	  Great concept, but didn't work for me  I got this when i found out I was pregnant 6 month after having my belly button pierced and I didn't want any chance of it closing up. It is too long and the balls on the end just fell off. It was just odd to wear. Ended up just getting a normal belly button ring that was a bit longer and took it out for delivery and but it back in afterwards and worked much better than this product. <end>  Loved It  I wore this almost my entire pregnancy and never had any issues. If you don't want to have to remove your belly ring during your pregnancy I'd recommend this product. <end>  Not really worth it  Looking back, I wouldn't purchase this item... both of the pieces are plastic and the little black ends fell off constantly. Not worth the hassle. <end>
 B000CPCT52  Purple Miracle Ball Horse Shoe Circular Barbell ||	  to small  the jewelery is very nice but to small for my nipple..so far I can only where bars with decoration haning frm it <end>
 B000CPIOO2  Jeweled Shamrocks Dangle Horse Shoe Circular Barbell ||	  Not the best  The shamrocks tarnished within a week and one fell off. Not the best made body jewelry I've come across - not sturdy material. <end>  Pretty but not so strong.  I liked it til it broke like the second week. The links should be a bit stronger... <end>
 B000CPJNII  Radical Red Black Hypnotic Horse Shoe Circular Barbell ||	  good and bad  All 4 plastic balls stripped, then broke in half within 2 weeks. lol. The metal rings are still worth the price though <end>
 B000CPJNJC  Green White Blue Striped Horse Shoe Circular Barbell ||	  Picture not 100% accurate  The colors are more see-through and blended than in the picture, and the green stripe is yellow, not green at all. <end>
 B000CPJNLU  Anchor Dangle Horse Shoe Circular Barbell ||	  Cute for a while  Belly button rings like this one are pretty cute but not meant for wearing a lot. If you wear them too much they break really fast. <end>
 B000CPLMT6  Sherbet Surprise Stripe Horse Shoe Circular Barbell ||	  May not be as pictured  They've recently changed the picture of this item, it used to be a ring with pastel colored stripes. When I ordered this item I received much more saturated colors, I uploaded pictures of it. I'm not sure if they still ship the one I got, or the one in their new picture, which STILL has different colors than the one I got. It's a cute ring though, reminds me of candy. <end>  Not the same as the photo  I ordered this and got it in about a week, which is good. But I got one with dark colors and not pastels, so I wrote and told them about it and they said they would send me another one, which they did in just a few days, but they sent me the same one they sent in the first place. So either they have the wrong photo up or a crappy camera cuz it doesn't look like the photo. <end>  watch for stripped top balls  I ordered this one, its a great color, but was defective. The company was great on how they handled the return. <end>
 B000CPLN0O  Sword Dangle Horse Shoe Circular Barbell ||	  sexy and swashbucklin  I got this to wear with my pirate costume for Halloween (and any other time I want a little sexy edginess). It is super cute, and one thing I love about this horseshoe style with danglies is that it'll fit great whether you have a regular or deep-set piercing. <end>
 B000CQ4YOK  Sterling Silver Volleyball Pendant, 1 1/16 inch ||	  silver volleyball necklace  Good quality silver volleyball necklace.Better than pictured on the internet. The delivery was very fast during the Christmas season.My daughter loves it. <end>  look close  When I ordered this pendant, I did not see the small football like grooves in it. It looks very weird in person. I went back to the picture and see it now. It totally distracts from the volleyball. Also, it tends to turn around a lot and since it is hollow you often find yourself looking at the inside of it - not too pretty! <end>
 B000CQG9RA  Lavender Freshwater Pearl Necklace with Sterling Bud Drop & Front Toggle Closure 17" ||	  Simple, Elegant & Perfect!  I bought this necklace to wear with my mother-of-the-bride dress. My dress is a deep amethyst color and I was worried that I might look too purple. The necklace is the perfect accessory. The pearls are beautiful--the colors change in the light. The toggle looks like it will stay closed, even while dancing. It really is simple, elegant and artfully crafted. <end>
 B000CQT4F4  Sedona Red Rocks Mosaic Inlay Sterling Silver Pendant ||	  Excellent product  Item just as beautiful in person as it is in the picture. Great craftsmanship and design! <end>
 B000CQY24W  Stud Earrings Sterling Silver - Celtic Knot Small Triangle ||	  Tiny and Delicate  these earring are really sweet, but they are really tiny!! If you are a person who likes big earrings, these may not be for you, but I have small ears and earlobes, so these work very well for me. The company is great and even sent me a catalog and a 10% coupon. <end>
 B000CQY26U  Dragonflies - Stud Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Tiny earrings  While these earrings are beautiful, they are way too small for human ears...maybe im exaggerating.., they would fit a baby. The detail is hard to see because of the size, and like another reviewer, mine were also bent. I gave two stars because they are nice, so if you want really small studs, then they might be right for you. <end>  Dragonfly earrings  These are very small and were badly bent on arrival. I was able to fix them, but I'm not happy with them. They were intended as a gift, now I'm not sure. <end>
 B000CQZZ5C  Stud Earrings Sterling Silver - Om ||	  Good second piercing  I liked them a lot - but a lottt smaller than I expected. It's a good second piercing size.. if only i had a second piercing <end>
 B000CQZZ66  10mm Bali Hoop Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  poor quality  In this case, you get what you pay for. Cheap price = poorly made product. <end>
 B000CQZZAW  Large Metal Studded Cutout Choker Necklace ||	  My Son Loves It but.....  I really wanted to get my son a cool necklace and came across this one. For $10 I thought Awesome! til I saw the $6 shipping charge!!!! But he'd already seen it & worked hard on his chores so I got it. The necklace is nice and seems sturdy. He has said anything about pinching his neck yet but it still doesn't justify the shipping charge in my mind. <end>
 B000CQZZH0  Pendant Sterling Silver - Celtic Triple Spiral ||	  Great little pendant  This pendant is a nice one. It comes attached to a leather cord, but its easily removable if you don't like leather cords. It has an antiqued finish to it so you can see the details. The picture does it justice pretty well, although it is slightly smaller than I was anticipating. <end>
 B000CQZZJI  Stud Earrings Sterling Silver - Yin-Yang ||	  small  Has good clarity of design, but is smaller than appears, they are very small. <end>
 B000CQZZJS  Stud Earrings Sterling Silver - Medieval Cross ||	  nice but much smaller than they appear  they are much smaller than they appear in the photo, but otherwise nice. shipping was quick and they are a good price <end>  Expedient Delivery  I was told by amazon that the earliest I would receive these was going to be on the 20th, but I received them today, the 19th. They are a little smaller than I thought they would, but overall I am happy. I have very sensitive ears. So I hope they do well with these earrings. They are also really beautiful! I love them! <end>
 B000CQZZM0  Celtic Dogs - Pendant Necklace Sterling Silver ||	  Beautiful and unique celtic pendant  This pendant is a great buy. It's about 2 inches wide and heavy. If you're a woman I'd definitely plan on a longer chain, because it's too big to be worn on a short one unless you're male. It's a beautiful, heavy piece and I'm very happy with it. <end>
 B000CR1XG6  Celtic Goddess Knot - Stud Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  very small!  I was extremely disappointed when I got those earrings as they turned to be microscopic in size! I will never wear them, because they don't catch the eye. On the picture those items look completely different. <end>  Great Gift!  Gave it to a friend who collects celtic goddess knotwork for a birthday, and she loved it. Simple, but nice. <end>
 B000CR40HK  Celtic Triskelion Triple Spiral -Stud Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Yay!  They are the cutest little pair of earrings I ever saw! So little and dainty! I am very happy with my purchase. <end>
 B000CR40IO  Skeleton Caduceus - Sterling Silver Pendant Necklace ||	  Far Out!  Just received this pendant and I have to say that it is impressive! The size is substantial and there is alot of detail in the design. Can easily be seen from a distance. The sterling silver has an oxidized appearance and is of substantial weight. It is a sturdy piece and one that you will not see coming and going on everyone! I love it! Could easily be priced higher. A real bargain! <end>
 B000CR40QG  Large Bamboo Bead & Hematite Ball - Necklace ||	  Close-Fitting  This isn't a bad necklace for its price. However, I think it should mention in the description that this is a close-fitting necklace. It would probably be more accurate to call it a choker. If you're like me, you prefer a necklace that isn't quite so clingy. <end>
 B000CR4FG6  Enhanced Black Cultured Pearl Bracelet w. Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Rose Clasp 7" (L1S3R2) ||	  Great Buy  This is a great purchase. This was a present for my wife and she did not need pearls uniform in size and color. I like the more natual look of this bracelet. My wife has told me that the internet is the greatest thing that ever happened to my gift giving. Thank you Amazon and Dahalia for making me look good. It was easy and effective. I have bought from other "wholesale" web sites and would rank Dahlia over them in quality, accuracy, cost and service. <end>  A beautiful bracelet!  This is a great bracelet! One of the things that I want in a bracelet is the ability to close the clasp by myself. - I hate to have to throw a bracelet in my pocket or purse and then go to work and ask someone to help me put it on! This clasp is easy to operate one-handed and there is enough "play" in the bracelet that you can do it yourself!The pearls are not perfectly round, but they are a generous size. I've had "enhanced" color pearls before that bled color any time the pearls got any moisture on them. This bracelet doesn't have that problem. The bracelet is easy to wear and looks really nice. I've had a number of nice compliments on it and I wear it often.I would have given the bracelet 5 stars if the pearls had been perfectly round, as shown in the photo on the website.For the money, this is a GREAT bracelet at a very good price. <end>
 B000CRNHX8  Sterling Silver Pure Brilliance Signity-Carat 5mm Stud Earrings ||	  Dun think its 925 sterling silver.  My ears are really sensitive and can only wear gold and silver earrings.Had infection after wearing these. So I dun think they were made 100% 925 stealing silver. <end>  Sparkles like the real thing  The design is classic, well excuted, sparkles like the real thing. I'll wear them often for work and a little sparkle with my casual wear. Very pleased with this purchase <end>  Nice earrings for the price.  I ordered these for my wife and they look very nice for the price. No, I don't think anyone that looks at them closely will mistake them for diamonds, but they are really just the right size so that most people will believe they are real and not try to look closer. <end>  Diamonique Signity 5mm Studs  These are not small earrings! Personally I think they are too big for a second piercing, which is what I got them for, but I am truly not disappointed. I wear them everyday & they are very comfy! Very well structured, nice snug backs. Lots of sparkle w/out being cheesy. Luuuuv them! (Attaching a pic....I know it helps to see how big "big" is! ) <end>  Beautiful!  I love these! They are small enough so they don't look overtly gregarious. They look exactly like real diamonds too! I have these as the first in a row of three, the following two are real diamonds, and honestly you cant tell the difference. I want more holes just so I can buy more of these in a larger size! <end>  Great studs  Bought a pair of these earrings, lost them and I'm gonna order the same exact ones again. Good size and very nice quality. The stones look good and the silver is very well polished. <end>  deedeedinah  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these earrings. Nice size. Great look. I got a compliment from a jeweler friend of mine. He said without his loop he thought they were real. I'm very pleased. <end>  Cute and worth the price  Based on the previous review, I figured for the price these little earrings would be a great staple in my wardrobe until I can actually afford real diamonds! They're sparkly and from a normal distance I doubt many people would be able to tell that they are not real. They're just the right size, too-if they were any bigger I think everyone would know they were fake because I couldn't afford them, hehe. I would recommend these to anyone that wants "diamond" studs but can't afford the real thing, but don't expect them to be identical to a real diamond. <end>  yuck  Do not waste your money. I depend heavily on reviews when making purchases from Amazon.com therefore I had to take the time and let shoppers know that these earrings are not worth any amount of money. After wearing them for two weeks the posts were black. Yuck! So they went right in the trash. <end>  Nothing Special  I thought these would look like real diamonds considering the diamonique name. However, when compared to my older $5 studs, I didn't see much of a difference. If you really want nice diamond earrings, I suggest you go real. <end>  Good quality - outstanding value  Having always been skeptical of cubic zirconia but not wanting to spend many hundreds of dollars on diamond studs, I decided to give these inexpensive earrings a try. I bought them along with another brand of cubic zirconia studs to compare their relative quality. The other brand was a waste of my time, but these earrings are well constructed and look great. The settings are well-made and substantial, and should stand up to heavy use. Having looked at real diamond studs a few times over the past few weeks, I find it hard to discern much difference between these earrings and the ones you see in jewelry stores for hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars. Cubic zirconia may never enjoy the same prestige as diamonds, but having now purchased both, I realize that a well-made CZ is a quality stone. In fact, these stones look noticeably better than the cloudy, uncertified diamonds you will see in mall jewelry stores. Even though she knows they are not diamonds, my wife loves these stones and can't stop looking at how sparkly they are. I consider these earrings an exceptional value - one of those rare times when the cliche is true. You cannot go wrong with this item. <end>  Very Much Like the Real Thing  I've lost so many real diamond stud earrings and have felt sick each time that I've decided to replace it with Diamonique. I've purchased CZ's set in 14K Gold and also spent a lot more than what I paid for these ones but each one were obviously CZ's. I've worn the first set for a few days now, was shopping at Macy's fine jewelry for a ring and the sales reps were very complimentary of my stud earrings. They were very impressed with its clarity and of course, I did not tell them they were not real. I bought 2 sets to make sure I had a back-up set available in the event I lose it again. Delivery was very quick and arrived way before the date I expected it to arrive. I will check out other items they sell in the event I can find a bracelet since I've lost a few expensive, real ones too. <end>  Glamorous without the price tag of glamorous  You cant go wrong with diamonique!!!!!Like my diamonique ring these shine like real diamonds. The sparkle is unbelievable. They are just the right size for a poor girl like me. I dont want to wear earings that look rediculously huge ,when all the people I know, know that I could never afford real diamonds that size. So these are appropriate and decieving. Affordable, pretty and about the size of a pencil erarer( Perfect size) IMO! For what that is worth, <end>  Great product! Really pleased with this purchase.  I was looking for a day-to-day discreet diamond looking earring for some time. I found this in the size I wanted (it is a small piece, but with good quality). I decided to give a try since the price was appealing and I couldn't be more satisfied, the item reached me in time. I have worn them at work and a few colleagues had already complemented them. I will definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  Very pretty.  These earrings are very pretty. The size is good, which is what I wanted. They look real and were so inexpensive! <end>  Sterling Silver Earrings  The earrings came and are what my wife wanted. They look very nice and she really likes them. I would recommend the earrings to people that want nice looking earrings for a low price. <end>  Better quality than I had hoped for  I thought that due to the relatively low price on these earrings that I was going to get very thin settings, which was the case when I bought a different set of inexpensive CZ earrings on Amazon. But much to my surprise, the settings are very sturdy and the normal-sized backings fit tightly on them (no chance of the backings slipping off like on the thinner-set pair which is how I lost one of them). The stones look EXACTLY like my real diamond earrings, very sparkly. They are a great size for everyday wear  not too big or too small. I am extremely pleased with this purchase. <end>  like it  smaller than what i thought it would be but these gets mistaken for real diamonds, and i get compliments from them when i wear my hair up and my ears visible. The clarity is nice, and the facets are just the right amount. For the price, I definitely love this. <end>  Didnt work out for me  They gave me a rash, I never has this issue so I am not sure what material they are made of. I will be returning them. <end>  Cheap stuff  The stud broke off one of the earrings. It was bent and I tried to straighten it. Bad idea huh? <end>
 B000CRNNQE  Alders' Classic Engagement Ring - 6 ||	  Sterling Silver and CZ ring  I loved the ring and how it looks, the quality of the sterling silver ring, and the delivery was speedy! It fits perfectly, is well made and looks authentic, without the worry of high insurance cost or fear of losing a stone. And I love the freedom of wearing a ring that looks and holds up like the real thing! <end>  Beatiful  It is perfect to use and better if it is from the person your love and will be married. <end>
 B000CRQOTW  Axel - Eye Protector Pewter Ring ||	  killer ring  it looks so freakin kool because that freaky skeleton and that its made of sterling-silver <end>
 B000CRQQCM  Classic Waves - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  NOT PURE STERLING SILVER AS DESCRIBED  I purchased this ring as a gift for my husband (who works on the ocean). The design is wonderful and unique. However, we have purchased (and wear) numerous items made of pure sterling silver and know that they do not turn your fingers green or tarnish. This item made a green ring around his finger within hours of putting it on. Within a couple days it was already turning gray/brown on the inside from tarnishing. It is NOT pure silver and should not be sold/described as such. It is a cheap piece of jewelry. Unfortunate, because the concept and design are very charming. <end>
 B000CRQQPY  Skull Signet - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Great looking ring  Delivered earlier than anticipated! Ring looks just like the picture. Very satisfied with product. <end>  What you see is what you get.  I bought this ring for my roommate for his birthday. It is just like it looks in he picture. Good solid, light but detailed. Well below the cost of what I saw it for in a popular retail store. I say if you like the look, buy it. <end>  not worth the time to try and sell this item  the item i received was distorted and not fit to wear,it was ripped on the bottom right hand side of the ring(top) it was not fit or safe to wear.it would've cut my finger. i sent it back ,have not heard from them yet i asked for a creit back to my account. <end>  Just what he wanted !  My husband seen this ring and fell in love , so it was given to him for a anniversary present , even though we had to have it resized for him as they out of his size , it was still a Lovely item. <end>  nice ring  a tad bit hollow inside, nothing a that i coulden't fix with a tourch an some silver wire. still a great ring, worth the trouble. <end>  Great Ring!  The detail of the skull on this ring is pretty amazing - especially for the price. And the fact that the skull is upraised allows the ring to be used like a signet or seal ring (the skull can be pressed into melted letter wax). The only problem I've had with it is that the back of the skull impression is hallowed out, so that there is air trapped between my finger and the ring, and this causes my finger to sweat a little. But, for such a great looking ring, it's certainly something I can live with. <end>
 B000CRQQQ8  Black Onyx Inlay - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Blue onyx?  A little disappointed as ring has a lot of nicks & rough looking. The onyx looks more dark blue than black.You can tell it's not an expensive ring. <end>
 B000CRQQUY  Skull & Snake - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  kick ass cool  this ring speaks for itself...it's kick ass cool! great weight, quality & detail. it's not a huge ring but the image speaks volumes. strangers & co-workers always do a double-take when they spot it on my hand. i'm a petite, asian, girl working at a design company so you can imagine the kinds of responses i get! <end>  Skull & Snake Ring  Perfect for Harry Potter Death-Eater Cosplay!!!Well made, great detail. <end>
 B000CRQR08  Wrap Around Dragon - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Just What I Wanted.  This is a quality piece of work, and I love showing it off to my friends. I sort of consider it my little good luck charm. The only problem about this ring is that you can't reach down into your pockets or wash your hands with it on, because it'll snag your clothing (or anything around it) and fall off when your hands are wet.Despite this flaw (it was expected), it's a wonderful piece of jewelry for any dragon lover. <end>
 B000CRT6D8  Pearl Essence 7-8mm AAAA Drop Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Pendant Necklace, White ||	  Dainty and elegant  I bought 3 of these necklaces as gifts for the young ladies in my wedding (junior bridesmaid, flower girl and guest book attendant). I received them very quickly and they are beautiful. The chain is very sparkley and the pearl will look quite dainty and elegant on a young girl's neck. I'm sure they will get a lot of wear out of their necklaces after the wedding in the years to come as they grow up and attend other special events. <end>  Perfect for my bridesmaids, exactly as described, beautiful!  I was leary of the chain that came with this necklace, but it is strong and sparkly. The pearls are perfect size, just as described. I couldn't be happier! These are a keeper! <end>  Very happy  I purchased 4 of these necklaces for gifts for my bridal party and I was very pleased when I received them. <end>  Pearl necklace glory  all over loved this...it was beautiful and I wear it all the time. You will not be sorry purchasing such a lovely necklace. <end>  The chain broke within hours of wearing it  I just received it today and wore it for the first time. Cute necklace, but as I was sitting in class, I felt the pearl fall down my shirt and realized the chain had spontaneously broken near the clasp. A bit disappointed - it was a pretty necklace. I'll be returning it. <end>  Just lovely!  And great sellers! I wanted a simple, elegant pearl necklace and I found it  ). I am super pleased and am sure I will wear it often! <end>  Pricey but satisfied  I think its a little too much of a price for a tiny pearl, but the item is good. I think they charge extra just to cover the cost of the lovely boxes they send with it.........not really fair, but ...! <end>  perfect!  I just purchased eight for my bridal party and they are perfect! Just the right size and the chain is so pretty! Delicate but doesn't look like it will snap or anything. The boxes these come in are just great, too.Thanks! <end>  very nice  very nice necklace and pendant. Pearl is a good size for a single pendant and the chain is beautiful with Italian quality. I got both 18 and 16 inches chain. I make one as gift to my best friend. It is a good keep shake gift. <end>  Beautiful Necklace!  This necklace is very pretty. I am so excited to give it to my bridesmaids! I like it so much that I ordered one for myself as well. <end>  Prettier than the picture  I got this necklace as a gift for my younger sister. I was a little worried about buying jewelry over the internet, but it arrived on time in a very nice box and was much prettier than the picture implies. The chain is pretty, but a little weak, but I will happily replace it when it snaps. <end>  LOVE IT!!!  I just got it in a mail today and it was totally amazing!! It looks beautiful and expensive!!! I love it for this price! <end>  beautiful simplicity!  I bought this for my daughter's 18th birthday next month, she wanted a simple pearl necklace and I didn't want to have to pay alot. This was perfect! The chain is beautiful, not tangled at all and came in a cute little box. I received it well before the estimated shipping date. I'm super happy with it and I know she will be also, it's well worth the price! <end>  beautiful pearl necklace  This is a beautiful, elegant small pearl pendant, which I bought for my 12-year-old daughter. It looks gorgeous on her. The pearl is of good quality, and we were pleasantly surprised by the delicate detail of the silver chain. The product was delivered promptly, well-packaged, and it even came in a pretty little embroidered silk bag with a drawstring--a nice surprise. I would definitely order jewelry from Dahlia again. <end>  Gorgeous piece of jewelry  I bought this necklace as one of two christmas gifts for my girlfriend this year. When the pendent arrived I opened it up to do a quality check and was surprised to see that it looked more beautiful then it does in the photo. My girlfriend loved it and couldn't help but to show it off to all of her friends for the next few days. I was given the rating of worlds best boyfriend. Dahlia Jewels was prompt with the shipping. I would certainly order from them again if ever I have the need. ( I'm sure I will.) Overall this is certainly a 5 out of 5! <end>  Loved It!!  I was looking for a pearl pendant necklace, and I couldn't find one that I liked anywhere; however, I decided it was time to try my luck with online shopping on Amazon. When this necklace arrived, I was so excited because it was absolutely beautiful! Definitely get this if you are looking for an elegant, yet simple necklace that will wow all your friends. <end>  Beautiful Pearl  I bought it for my girlfriend, for Christmas. I had hesitation because had no chance to see before to buy. I researched many pearl necklaces, read the comments, etc. And decided to buy this one.It is really beautiful, the pearl's size is ideal and quality, shape, colour, etc. look good. My girlfriend liked it very much and it is on her neck everyday. I didn't buy the earings yet but wanna buy soon. <end>  I really like this...  The only thing i'm kind of cautious about is the chain...looks and feels so fragile...hope it lasts and doesn't break since giving it as a Christmas gift as well. <end>  Epic Necklace  Great necklace for the price. I gave it to my wife at the birth of our son. She loves it and wears it all the time. <end>  Perfect!  I purchased these pendants as gifts for my wedding party and they are just perfect! I wanted something affordable but something that was good enough quality to be a keepsake. You can look around if you want but this was the best quality for an affordable price that I could find anywhere and will go perfect with my bridesmaid's dresses! <end>  Simple Beauty  I have always wanted a small pearl pendant--nothing fancy just a beautiful and simple pearl pendant and it is all that and more. <end>  Pretty necklace  I bought these for my 6 bridesmaids and although they haven't received them I know they will love them. I had been looking for reasonably priced pearl necklaces/pendants for a while. For $27 they are wonderful! They are better than I expected. I also really appreciate the very unique and pretty boxes they came in. Perfect gift! <end>  Pearl Pendant  This necklace is really pretty. It's very simple, but that's actually a good thing in my opinion. For the price, I don't think you'd be able to find something better. Also, it comes in a really great box, so you don't need to buy anything else to give it as a gift. I really hope my girlfriend likes it! <end>
 B000CRTH5U  Small Band - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Beautiful Ring, Fast Service!  Great ring. Received it right away in good packaging. The detailing on this ring is better than anticipated and it's a substantial weight and feel. You might consider going up a half size. I'm usually a size seven and it's a tight fit, so I'm going to order another one in a 7.5 to wear in the summer when my fingers are a little swollen. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase! <end>
 B000CRTI1S  Sterling Silver Ring Kokopelli Peli - Size 8 ||	  silver ring  I bought the ring as a replacement for one that I had lost. It is almost exactly like the one I originally had. I wear it almost every day. <end>
 B000CRTIR2  Medium Skull - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Classic Ring!  This is a good solid ring! Very shiny, high polished and weighty, not likely to break unless you decide to take a hammer or somthing else to the extreme to try and bust it. I've already been to the bars and on vacation with it. The only thing is that it tarnishes under heavy salt water and chlorine water exposure - BUT that'll happen to any jewlery so this is definately worth the monies!!! <end>  Skull Ring  Nice ring! It has some weight to it, even in the small size that I purchased. The ring is shiny, although from the photo it looks more like it would have a dull finish, which is what I thought it would be when I ordered it. Makes no difference, I still think it's a real nice ring. Worth its price. <end>  just to be noted  the ring arrived quickly and saftly, and the quality is awesome, although, the picture is a bit decieving. the picture depicts the skull ring with blacked out eyes, and a dark, kinda tarnished look to it, plus some extra detail, not on my ring. its not as evident as i make it seem (hence 4/5 stars) but if im paying [...] bucks for a quality ring, i want it as shown. again, i love the ring, and i buy from the seller again, but the detaisls till count. <end>  dISAPOINTMENT !!!!  Hi guys,I am glad that I can express myself and tell how disapointed I was when I received the ring. IT'S JUST NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE SCREEN. THE FOREHEAD IS FLAT AND IT LOOKS MORE VOLUMINOUS in the picture. ARE U SURE IT'S THE SAME ITEM U SENT ME ? See I am used to ordering shoes for instance and i have never been disapointed. Ok I think I can't do more about it. Anyway thanks for letting me express myself and it won't stop me from ordering anything else. Actually I feel like ordering another ring. HA HA !!!! <end>  size????  Yeah, it looks nice, but it could be as big as Diana Ross's eyeballs!!!cm?mm?Description old glory...come on! This is the internet. Be descriptive. <end>
 B000CRTITU  Coiled Snake - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  IT BROKE  I bought the ring and the first time he put it on his hands were sweaty and the metal left a mark on his finger. He then wore it for three weeks and it started to crack and finally broke. I would not recommend this ring at all. <end>  love it!  I own this great snake ring and have gotten many compliments on it!It is one-of-a-kind!! <end>  you get what you pay for.  very nice ring on the outside, but the inside of the ring does not reflect the same craftsmanship on the outside. No one will see the inner surface of the ring when it on someone`s finger but it does deflate the overall satisfactions of the product. The price of the ring is very favorable and if it was made from a more expensive metal and had this quality of work put it, i will truly be disappointed but at this price, I have little room to complain. you get what you pay for and i do enjoy it. <end>  Cute  I love it. It is cute but was a little snug. It is not overly large for my finger either. <end>  COOL!!  Finally! A ring that looks EXACTLY like the picture and is a very cool piece that gets lots of compliments. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. <end>  Coiled snake ring  I bought this ring long time ago and is very peculiar and original a little uncomfortable in the beginning and it looks cheap, but i like it. <end>  Very attractive ring.  I purchased this ring for my fiance and she absolutely loves it. It's made of heavy sterling silver that is sure to give her many years of wearing pleasure. It's a great value! <end>
 B000CRTIZ4  Pentacle & Snakes - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  A perfect Pentagram.  When I saw this ring I just had to purchase it...Its so unlike any other and the price is unbeatable...It is made very strong and is impossible to miss...I receive compliments on it daily...A must have for any sophisticated practioner ov the Black Arts...You can also where it with the point up or point down...I have it pointed down for various reasons...cheers. <end>  Not Sterling Silver  The ring looked just like the photo on Amazon; however I was very upset when I wore it because my finger turned black where the ring touched my skin. This ring was not sterling silver. <end>  Excellent ring  this is a beautiful and mystic ring, the shean of the silver is quiet breath taking for the price. This was worth the pay, if your thinking of buying this dont hesitate, its an easy choice  ) <end>  The only piece of jewery I NEVER take off...  This is my favorite piece of jewelry, hands down, and I NEVER take it off. When I do, I feel naked.  p <end>
 B000CRTJ3K  Cut-out Celtic Knot - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Great product!  This is a great ring for the price! Looks good and feels on the finger. Excellent service from Old Glory, too!Cut-out Celtic Knot - Sterling Silver Ring <end>
 B000CRVB54  Skull Band - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Skulls  Great ring high quality and great looking.....short and to the point buy it its a great ring! <end>  Good ring! GF loved it  The ring is exactly as described. Feels well made and is exactly what my gf was looking for. The only complaint was I was hoping it would come in a box but the bag was fine. <end>  Head & a half joint  Unfortunately, the joint that allows for sizing this ring is actually a skull. On my ring, a size 11, it appears to be conjoined twins. Also, the ring is pretty thick at the top of the skulls. I'm wearing this as a thumb ring, but imagine that putting in on any of the three smallest fingers would be very uncomfortable. <end>
 B000CRVBEU  Cutout Ankh - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Waiting On My Exchange  I waited too long for delivery. It took nearly 2 weeks for me to received a shipment that supposedly shipped the same or next day. I received a ring that was much larger in size than the order specified, and the band was bent. I requested a size 10, and the bandwidth of the item I received exceeded the size 10 bandwidth on the ring sizing chart.I returned the ring via certified mail and requested an exhange. The return was confirmed received on Friday 3 August. The vendor kindly informed me that the order would be processed and shipped on Monday 6 August. Except for the flawed band & wrong size, I like the design and alloy. But if this order takes more than a week to receive, I will not purchase from this merchant again because the delivery time does not justify the original shipping cost. Moreover, if the exchange is sized incorrectly or the band is bent, I will request a refund. <end>  Ankh Ring  I love my ankh ring. the size is true to the fit and the service was fast. <end>  PERFECT  My ring arrived in just a few days and is even better quality than I thought it would be. I am very satisfied with my purchase. <end>  Loved this ring!!!!,, BUT ...  absolutely love this ring..looks just like the picture, but the sizing does run kinda small.overall, NEVER GONNA TAKE IT OFF!!!!!! <end>  Nice Ring!  This is a lovely Ankh ring. Although it is not the typical Ankh (with closed bottom), it is very well-made and attractive. Sterling Silver-good quality. <end>
 B000CRVBFY  Celtic Irish Friendship / Love Claddagh - Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Ring  I was very disappointed that when I got this item it was bent. It took a long time to try and return it also. <end>  celtic friendship ring  The ring arrived in the time stipulated for delivery. Was not overly impressed with the quality. The condition of the metal looked almost tarnished and very cheap. So far has held together well though. <end>  Great  Item is exactly what I thought it would be. No problems with the purchase or the product <end>  great celtic ring  My daughter loved this ring because it was not just the traditional claddagh ring. It is the envy of her high school friends. <end>
 B000CRXBIO  Sterling Silver Ring Multi-Level Band ||	  Very misleading  This ring is not as big in person and the design that goes around the ring does not match up at the seams. It is actually crooked. Don't waste your money on this one. <end>
 B000CRXBOS  Sterling Silver Ring Jumping Frogs - Size 10 ||	  UNIQUE DESIGN !!!  This is one of a kind ring. You'll only find it here at Old Glory. These little jumping frogs lined up aroung the ring are different that everything I've seen (I got a size 6 and they cover 2/3 of the ring band). Comfortable to wear and true to size. Nice silversmith work, an eye catcher and a conversation piece. Love it! <end>
 B000CS15R2  My Dream - My Love - My Life Ring - 8 ||	  Beautiful Ring!  This is a gorgeous ring. I love the unique design and how it sparkles and shines. I've received some very nice compliments too. <end>  Beautiful ring  I am very glad I made this purchase. I can't stop looking at my hand when I wear this. The only thing I wish was different is that it would be real silver but I didn't pay that much for it so I am very happy! <end>
 B000CS5XEI  Completely Handcrafted - Designer Sterling Silver 14 Brilliant Cut Gem Top Sky Blue Fire Moonstone Ring ||	  top sky blue fire moonstone ring  i think this ring is very beautiful.i would have never found one like this.it is very unusual. <end>
 B000CS80XE  Completely Handcrafted - Designer Hand Painted Multi Color Leather African Wood Bracelet ||	  JaJem Bracelet  The item is wonderful. I bought it as a gift, but I'm seriously considering keeping it for myself! It took awhile to get here, I didn't realize it was being shipped from Bangkok. It arrived well packed and in excellent condition. <end>
 B000CS9F2O  Earspiral Earrings ESP2CHBABYBFGFGP, 14K Gold-filled Earwire & Chains, 14K Gold plated Butterflies ||	  Exceptional product  Arrived as predicted, impressive items, have received a lot of compliments. Will order again! <end>
 B000CSGZXQ  Thread Earrings    THXLSS    Extra Long Length, Sterling Silver ||	  Threads  I didnt like these when I first got them, they do not look like the picture. They worked out okay though. <end>
 B000CSIUL6  Thread Earrings    THLTSTSS    Long Length with twisty ends, Sterling Silver ||	  perfect "everyday" earrings  i've been wanting threaders AND i've been wanting earrings that I can just leave in. I'm horrible at taking off and putting on jewelry so once its on, its on.  ) Anyway, these threaders are sooooo light, i forget i'm wearing them. Its light and thin to the point that i'm certain it will break BUT the seller does offer lifetime warranty for if it does break. Sounds like a winner to me! I slept with them and completely forgot about them. Not to mention the always fun comments of "how do you get those earrings in your ear" comments haha. I would definitely purchase this again. <end>
 B000E0E2SW  NEW! Diamond Tester Selector *High Accuracy* Ship in US ||	  for size it is great  It is a small tester, however it gives big results. Worked well on known and unknown stones. Would recommend this to any dealer or novice. <end>  good for your hobby  this is a tool for the beginner not the seasond prolooking for something cheep to get your hobby off to a good startlook no farther show it off to your friendsand look like a pro doing it <end>  Dia  A surprisingly inexpensive device that does exactly what you want it to do.Many similar testers are listed for prices way above this one.Why pay more for the same thing?We're very happy with it. <end>  Diamond Tester  This was a gift for my wife and she loves it. Definitively a great price, recommend item to my friends. <end>  NOT USER FRIENDLY  THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, ALL SORTS OF REQUIREMENTS AND POSITIONS TEMPERATURES AND SIZES OF STONES MUST BE CALCULATED IN ORDER TO ALLEGEDLY GET AN ACCURATE RESPONSE....****NOTE THIS PRODUCT THINKS MY WIFE'S WATCH CRYSTAL IS A DIAMOND.....NEED I SAY MORE?....HEY HONEY MAYBE IT MEANT YOU ARE A DIAMOND  ) <end>  Diamond Tester Rating  Not too impressed with this as it can produce the effect that it's a real diamond when it's not without touching anything around the stone too. <end>  UGH  This device is way to hard to use...can't calibrate the dang thing. I'm sure it will never work properly. Not at all impressed. <end>  It works!  If you follow the instructions, it works very well. I tested it on stones I knew were actual diamonds and on cz's and you could tell by the way it beeped what they were. <end>  Works well  I have used it on diamonds and it worked well. If you follow the directions there is no mistaking the fake from real. <end>  my new tester  didn't know how easy it is, know i tell the difference between made, & real diamonds at pawn shops & what people have. <end>  COOLEST EVER  This little device is the neatest thing that i have ever scene!!! I go around the house testing everything and then take it to my friends houses and test their stuff as well <end>  Diamond Tester  I thought my diamond tester would have been more designed like the one's you would see in a jewelry store..... <end>  Not impressed  Not very accurate. Can't get it to work very well, beeps on everything from diamonds to glass. Still not sure if it's a diamond or not. <end>  Diamond Tester does not work at all  Have tried this product on several items. You have to do to many manual inputs and has not gotten the correct answer on diamonds once This is a cheaply made tool and does not work at all <end>
 B000E1U7MG  Shiny Pink Chain Earrings ||	  Cute but kinda cheap  I got these on sale for $4.99, so I can't say I'm disapointed, but the three smallest beads are very plastic and don't hide it well. The pink stone is pretty, very clear and well set. These earing hang quite low, so it's not a good piece to wear casually. It's more of a dress-up-for-the-club type earing.It's not worth the sticker price at all, but if it's on sale, go for it! <end>
 B000E1WH1U  Royalty Bone Collar Necklace [Limited Time Blowout Offer] ||	  Beautiful!  I am very pleased with the quality of this necklace. Even with the size, it's lightweight enough to not be a bother when wearing it. The wood on mine is darker than pictured and more fluid in color (not as much variance) which I like as well. I am very happy with this and am sure the compliments are forthcoming! <end>  Unusual Looking Necklace  VERY ATTRACTIVE NECKLACE FOR SUMMER CLOTHES. DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I HAVE. WILL ENJOY WEARING THIS SUMMER. THANKS! <end>  Just Beautiful  I am so pleased with this piece. It looks terrific and I have received many compliments. It arrived quickly and the price was fabulous!!! Can't go wrong with this necklace!!! <end>
 B000E398RY  Sterling Silver Green Millefiori Glass and Crystal Bracelet 7.5 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Big Surprise!!!  I bought this for a friend that liked swarovski and green, she almost fainted when she opened the box and saw these gorgeous bracelet. Great design!!! <end>  OMG!! Absolutely gorgeous  OMG!!!!! SO Much more gorgeous than expected. Giving this one to Mom, ordering one more for a very special person & adding this item to my birthday wish list... hint hint hubby!!!!! <end>
 B000E39H3E  3.60 TCW Trilliant-Cut Genuine Amethyst Sterling Silver Earrings and Solitaire Pendant and Chain Set ||	  Jewelry much lightercolor then picture shown.  Jewelry recieved is much lighter color then picture show, but delivery time was quick and in great condition. <end>
 B000E3BQWE  PalmBeach Jewelry Goldtone Metal Beaded Multiple-Strand Bib Necklace Adjustable 17&quot; to 20&quot; ||	  The Picture....  ...is misleading. As another reviewer stated, the product looks cheap. The photo is not a true depiction of the necklaces. I have yet to wear it. <end>
 B000E3BRCS  Cultured Freshwater Pearl Sterling Silver 18&quot; Necklace Bracelet and Stud Earrings Set ||	  cheap irregular pearls  The actual product looks nothing like the picture these are the quality you would buy in the toy section for a buck at walmart <end>
 B000E3CF7E  SCBR011 .925 Sterling Silver Pink and Clear Austrian Swarovski Crystals 7.5" Bracelet Toggle Clasp MADE WITH SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS ||	  Disappointed  I purchased this for my wife based on the other reviews, which are very positive. It was not at all what I expected. She was unimpressed with it when I showed it to her, so I returned it for a refund. It basically looks like some pink cut glass on a silver chain. <end>  Better than expected  After I submit a order, I begin to warry about whether it is worth the price. When I receive it, it looks great. Better then i expected. <end>  Very beautiful but a little on the large side  I bought this bracelet as a gift for my mother. I couldn't really tell from the picture, but the crystals in the middle part of the bracelet are quite a bit larger than those at the ends. I wasn't wild about this, as my mother prefers more minimalist jewelry, but the bracelet is absolutely lovely and shines beautifully. I was almost sad to give it to her because I'd have to give up being able to look at it whenever I wanted.Very beautiful piece of jewelry - just be aware that it is a bit "large" and the middle is thicker than the ends. <end>  Sparkling Pink Bracelet  I ordered this bracelet to match the earrings I gave my daughter for Christmas. She loves it...put in on her arm and wore it all day and plans to wear it when she works as a hostess/manager at a high-end restaurant. It is beautiful and I would definitely consider ordering from this site again. <end>  Very Nice  I bought this as a gift and was very impressed when it arrived. The bracelet is very beautiful and quite shiny. Looks nice. <end>
 B000E4AEYO  Sterling Silver Swirl Heart Pendant ||	  Swirl Heart Pendant  I bought this for my mother-in-law as a mother's day gift. This heart to me, is the representation of a madonna and child and therefore would suit the date perfectly. When I got it I liked it right away. It's not too little, there is a heaviness added to the piece as it's not paper thin. The adjustable snake chain that comes with it is pretty convenient too. My Mom loved it. <end>
 B000E4ARF0  Sterling Silver Oval Dangle Earrings ||	  Surprisingly nice!  I'm normally not a big jewelry fiend, and if I were, I wouldn't be scouting earrings at Amazon. But these earrings popped at special 50 percent off sale, so I figured, why not give them a try?First off, the 50 percent off wasn't $9 like I thought, but $4.50! Wow, these earrings would really have to suck to make this a bad deal at that price.But lo and behold - I got them today, and they're really NICE! A nice heavy weight (for the type of earring it is), solid french wires, and they're pretty. Just a nice, cool touch if you wear a lot of black like I do, and earrings are your primary means of decoration, and you really like sterling silver.They were a total bargain at $4.50, but they are still very much worth $9! The perfect accompaniment to any little black dress (or any little black anything!) <end>  pleased with purchase  I purchased the earrings because they were on sale, but after receiving would have been more than happy to have paid full price. They are beautiful and are of excellent quality. <end>  Nice Gift, Modest Price  I bought three of these earringss to give as gifts. They were so inexpensive I worried they may look cheap. But I was happy when they arrived. They are packaged in a velvet drawstring bag and then in a nice box. The packaging helps them look way more expensive than what I paid. <end>  Good buy  Very nice. I wear them for work. Are a little small but great for the price. <end>  Beautiful Earrings!  These earrings are very beautiful and the quality is great. In fact, I am wearing these earrings today! <end>  Nice gift for the teen  The purchasing experience was great. I received the product in a timely manner and the packaging was in good tack. <end>  Amazon Jewlery  Great Value  I ordered 3 pairs of the Sterling Silver Oval Earrings. Two sets were for gifts and 1 for myself. I was quite pleased with the style & they were a hit & much appreciated by my daughters. This is the second sterling silver item I have ordered of the Amazon collection. I have been happy with the quality and the price. Where else can you get a pair of Sterling Silver Dangle earrings for just $9.00!!! <end>  Not wearable  The fishhook that goes in your ear is very large. In fact too large for my pierced ear. If your lobes are stretched they will probably be okay. Other than that they are cute enough. <end>
 B000E4ARGY  Sterling Silver Children's Pink Flower Heart Locket, 13" ||	  Do not but this item! Mine arrived broken and was concealed!  Ordered as last minute Christmas gift for my 6 yr old girl. The flowers are not pink. The chain was in a knot when I opened the package. After unraveling the chain I found out why - it was broken. I believe it was shipped broken and knotted to hide it. Poor quality item. Overpriced and did not look like the images. Only positive is that it arrived on time. Pathetic. <end>  Beautiful little girls necklace  My daughter fell in love with her necklace the minute she saw it. She received the necklace for her 5th birthday. <end>  Not at all like image, item arrived with chain knotted  I have a disappointed little girl who received this for Christmas from her grandma. It arrived in a box with the necklace in a velvet bag, a KNOTTED necklace. So even though she wanted to wear her very special necklace from grandma it had to wait until I had time to unknot it. I attempted to gently unknot the necklace using a pin and even though I used no force the chain still manged to come undone at the clasp. The clasps are incredibly tiny so it is going to be close to impossible to 'fix' this so she can wear it and honestly, if it broke so easily it isn't really sturdy enough for a child to wear. We are terribly disappointed and in no way can I recommend purchasing this item. <end>  locket review  The locket iteslf looked nice, but it was way too small. I bought it for my 7 year old and it looked very tiny on her. I decided to return it and that experience was not what I expected. I though it would be very easy to get my money back, but that wasn't the case. Two weeks after I mailed the item, I realized I hadn't received any communication from amazon confirming the receipt of my item. I was worried that the item might have gotten lost in the mail so I e-mailed the returns department to inquire about it. They responded quickly that they had received the item and were processing the refund. I waited another two weeks and still no refund. I was not happy because I coudn't understand why it should take more than a month to obtain a refund. After calling them a couple of times I was able to get my refund. I feel that I shouldn't have to go through all that to obtain a refund. <end>  Nice Necklace  I bought this for my 5 year old grandaughter in memory of her dad who was killed in Iraq. She loved it. The locket is perfect for a young girl, however,the chain that came with it is very fine and difficult to fasten. I bought a sturdier chain to go with this locket. I am very pleased with this purchase. <end>  Too small  This was a cute locket but far too small to put any sort of a photo in it . The only use it would serve would be a charm never to be opened. Not worth the price. <end>  Child's Locket  This little girl's locket is an adorable addition to my 4 year old niece's jewelry; she loves it. <end>  Pink Flower Locket  Overall, a good 1st locket for my almost 6 year old. It is a bit small, so photos going in are pretty tiny. Also, chain was a bit flimsy..was afraid it might break, so swapped it out with a sturdier and little bit longer one which will allow my daughter to actually look at the photos while wearing. <end>  excellent gift for 6 year old with older sister.  I purchased this as a gift for my 6 year old niece. The flower adds the girlish charm. She absolutey adores this locket.Her older sister has all the kool stuff.She has already picked out a picture to put in her special locket. <end>
 B000E4C8AW  Sterling Silver Asymmetrical Cuff Bracelet ||	  Cheap looking and feeling!  I love the idea of a modern design for a cuff - my mother has many, yet they are always on her birthday/Christmas/Mother's Day lists. It arrived today in a nice velvet drawstring bag but that's where the "class" ended. The bracelet had no weight whatsover and the design is such that it could be easily squished. The photo on the website doesn't show how the "interior" is poorly seamed. This definitely does not have the look or feel of sterling silver. It seems like a bracelet one might buy at Target for $12 - $15 as a funky accent piece, $45 is WAY to expensive for a piece of this quality. Cheap, cheap, cheap! <end>  Cheap and Uncomfortable  Completely cool idea, but very badly executed. It doesn't fit well, and feels like I would break it very easily. I returned it the same day that I received it. <end>  So many things gone wrong...  I had very high hopes for this bracelet, as I purchased it as a gift for my Grandmother. A friend of mine purchased two of these, and I thought it was quite odd when she told me that she wanted to get one of them reshaped. Amazon clearly has a quality control issue, as the bracelet I received was very deformed. I looked like it was flattened from what should have been a circle shape into an oval. I could wear it, but I would have to concentrate on how I held my wrist all night long. Any motion of the arm at all made it fall off!On a topic I know people don't approve of, the packaging was horrid. The bracelet was forced into a box that was obviously too small, as it was taped shut. Also, it barely fit in the velvet pouch it came in. Amazon should be relieved that this is not the only piece that I have purchased from them, because if it were, they would no longer get my business. <end>  Awful!  I was seriously disapponted in this bracelet. It is completely unwearable. The bracelet should be in the shape of a C with only a small opening for the wrist to slip in and remain secure. This is not the case here - this bracelet is in the shape of a U and falls off with any slight movement. If you intend to sit motionless all day, then this is the bracelet for you. For the rest of us...keep shopping. <end>  ~~STRANGE~~ bracelet  It was very pretty looking but virtually useless.It was open on the side which left no possible way to wear it without it falling off.I bought it for $18.00 but even at that price, it was no bargain. <end>  brillant  Excellent choice of cuff for that special lady that loves silver, made a hit for the speacial day ,it looks radiant on her wrist it was perfect for her <end>
 B000E4C8BQ  Sterling Silver Blue Flower Stud Earrings ||	  darling earrings  small and delicate and perfectly suited for young girls or for adults wanting a super cute little earring... nicely made and vibrant in color <end>  Sterling Silver Blue Flower Stud Earrings  I purchased these lovely earrings for my young nieces who just adored them.

 B000E7R2LO  .925 Sterling Silver Band Princess cut Aquamarine Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  no sparkle  While the order was shipped promptly, the ring didn't dazzle me. It has no sparkle at all. It looks like a piece of badly cut glass. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who cares about the cut of a stone. the size fits a little large also, so be aware. <end>  A little disappointed  I only gave this three stars because the aquamarine stone does not shine as much as the citrine ring. I bought this one because I loved the citrine one. The ring is nice overall but does not stand out as much as the other one. The ring did come fast, it came within four days. If you have the citrine ring I don't recommend this one because you will be disappointed.Sterling Silver Band Citrine Cubic Zirconia Ring <end>

 B000E94XI2  Amazon.com  US Air Force U.S.A.F. Pilot Wing Insignia Pin Set  Clothing ||	  Beautiful  I got this item because im leaving for the Air Force soon. Arrived before it said it would. Just an amazing pin all together. Solidly built, doesn't seem weak at all. The only thing is the picture isnt accurate to the product. Its the same design just a polished finish instead of the dusty finish in the picture. 5 out of 5 <end>  The unknown  I sent the Wings as a gift and was never informed if they were received or not. I was an Vance Air Force Base Instructor Pilot from 1955 -1958. One of the best Pilots I ever trained was killed during a flight 2 weeks after pilot training graduation.

 B000E9WHT4  Southwestern Native American Handcrafted Bear Paw Link Bracelet in Sterling Silver and Turquoise, #11315 ||	  Less then expected  Well you get what you pay for. Extremely light weight links are cheap, clasp the same broke first day. Looks very nice, however smaller then thought and the paws are hollow. Just no quality. Worth $12.00 at most.

As part Native american I'm embarssed. <end>  Southwestern Native American Handcrafted Bear Paw Link Bracelet  The Southwestern Native American Handcrafted Bear Paw Link Bracelet was a gift for my daughter-in-law who loved the fact that the bracelet is Authentic Native American handicrafted.

I wish I would have bought myself a pair! <end>  As Advertised  I ordered these for my wife after receiving an inferior pair from another website. Because it was so close to Christmas, I also paid the premium price for expedited shipping, which almost doubled the cost. The good news is that the amount was STILL less than I had paid the other website! The color was dark and vibrant, and we loved the "good luck" symbol on the ear post. Very happy! <end>  Love the item  I purchased these earrings for a friend of mine. She loves them. They are just exactly what I ordered and has a glamorous look to them.

 B000EB3QZG  Southwestern Small Horse or Pony Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver, #11280 ||	  Too Large for Kids Ears  The earrings are fine quality, but just not for kids. The size of the item should have been included. <end>
 B000EB46KU  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 6mm Hammer Polished Finish Band Ring Size 5 to 13 ||	  6mm Hammer Finish Ring  Very beautiful ring! Came in a cute little ring box just like the description said. Was packed very carefully, so there were no worries about the condition of the ring when it arrived. I love it!The only dissatisfaction I had was the ring seemed to be a bit smaller than its actual size, making for a tight fit. <end>
 B000EB5W4E  Southwestern Tiny Howling Wolf or Coyote Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver, #11275 ||	  4 items purchased; 3 going back  Wolf Dream Catcher is actually smaller than pictured. While it is nice, one must look closely to figure out what the medallion actually is. Light but sturdy. The beaded adornments slide along the cord freely and with some work on your part, it might hang at its longest nicely.However, the cord is quite thin and disappointing and seems to be permanently curled from packaging and shipping position. No matter what I do, I cannot seem to straighten the cord so it hangs evenly. There are several twists and curls in it that make it look dumb. Although it is adjustable by a simple pull-the-knot-through-the-loop closesure, it doesn't stay where you put it. The slightest movement and it drops back to its longest.This would be much nicer on a chain that hangs appropriately. However, the openings in the adornment beads is so small, I doubt purchasing a separate chain would work. While the chain might fit through the beading and the bail for the medallion itself, I have yet to figure out how to get the loop at the beginning of the chain (that the lock attaches to) through the beads to begin the threading process. Don't think there is a chain out there small enough to fit yet strong enough to hold. Now, if one wanted to remove the loop for the closure on a chain, thread the chain through the beads and medallion and then reattach the closure loop, I am sure that would work. I just don't want to go through all that work. This is going back.p.s. I also purchased, at the same time, the Wolf Tooth necklace. Same holds true for that one. And in the picture online, the wolf's head appears to have varied colors on it distinguishing it from the 'tooth'. However, mine is all the same color so, once again, unless one looks closely, it is difficult to determine what the medallion actually is. The cord is the same as above. This one is also going back.The Wolf Earrings, on the other hand, while small, are great. Sturdy post that doesn't seem as if it will bend easily. These are very small so look best as a second piercing adornment, but can be worn alone for a more subdued look.The Wolf Cuff bracelet is nice, and looks much sturdier than it is. The first time I put it on and tried to gently bend the sides to fit my wrist better as one must do with most cuffs, the section where the wolf is attached got 'bend marks' in it. So now the cuff looks like a 3-sided box - actual bend marks showing top and both sides. I'll keep it because I bent it but doubt I'll wear it often. <end>  Nice earrings while they lasted  /  these earrings were my favorite til i lost them in a fight...i almost went looking for them after but it was 2 dark and i lost these nice earrings(dont fight with nice earrings) <end>  Perfect wolves  I wear these very realistic wolves in my second hole. I receive compliments and pleasant questions about them. I wear them most of the time. <end>  Wolf Earrings  The only thing I was disappointed in the earrings is the size. I thought they might be a little bigger. I love the details in the earrings. I would highly recommend this seller to anyone who loves wolf jewelry like I do. <end>
 B000EBA6G8  Tiny Unicorn Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver, #11273 ||	  Earrings  The earrings were a gift for my Granddaughter. I am pleased with the product and my Granddaughter loves them. <end>  Precious and sturdy  The earings were perfect. They were sturdy and safe to put in my little girl's newly pierced ears.

 B000EDRUZG  Sapphire Flower Ring 14k White gold ||	  Poor Quality Poor Customer Service  Gave ring to daughter for 13th birthday. A Sapphire fell out within two hours of wearing the ring. Called that afternoon 9/17 and was told to ship item priorty mail, insured(shipped 9/18) and a new ring would be mailed immediately upon receipt. Three phone calls later, I have received nothing but a run-around. Today, 10/10 told they never received my package, disputed that based on prior phone calls and insured confirmation, and then finally told that the package has been misplaced and they would have to reprocess a new order. Demanded a full refund and got an arguement. Szul is suppose to send an email confirmation confirming cancellation. I'll hold my breath and going to dispute the charges with my credit card company. <end>

I just got this necklace yesterday and I am ordering another one today! It is so dainty and elegant and I have got three compliments already today! Well worth $20.00! So pretty! <end>  Nice Gift  This piece is simple, clean, and well worth the money. Amazon packages this pendant like good jewelry. It makes fine gift. <end>  Loved It.....now I want one....  I bought this as a gift and now I want one - very elegant - not cheap looking at all - looks great on my cousin..... <end>  My friend loves it!  I bought my friend this pendant as a birthday present. She loves it! I think it looks really elegant with its simple design. Suitable for all occasions. <end>
 B000EG6FYU  Sterling Silver Open Marquis Pendant, 18" ||	  Nice for the Price  I bought three of these pendants to give as gifts. They were so inexpensive I worried they may look cheap. But I was happy when they arrived. They are packaged in a velvet drawstring bag and then in a nice box. They look very shiny and pretty. <end>  Nice Little Necklace  Well, I had this on one of my wish lists & recently received it as a "put a smile on my face" gift. I'd have to say I feared it would look or be cheap, but it's a very nice, simple little necklace. I have sensitive skin & so far in the couple of days I've worn it, no problems. I do wish the chain was a little longer, otherwise, a fashionably versital piece of jewelry I can wear with just about anything. Got the earrings to match, not as happy with them  ( <end>  Great small gift  Looks better than what i saw in the pic. Considering the price I pay, I am very satisfied with it. <end>  modern and shinny  It goes well with most of my clothes.Perfect jewelry for week days ) <end>  Nice for the price  I needed some small extra gifts for my wife, so this pendant (with matching earrings" fit the bill. She really likes the style. The pendant appears to be well made and is a good deal. <end>  Charming.  Because I got such a great deal I was not expecting the necklace to be as nice as it turned out to be. Although on the small side (chain and piece) they are quite striking. I get a compliment almost everytime that I wear it. <end>  great price  My wife loved this little neclace. Just enough to make her smile. That's all that counts in my book. Came in a nice box and it sure made it seem like it was more expensive than the few $$ I spent on it. <end>
 B000EG6FZY  Sterling Silver Small Eternity Earrings ||	  Not as I expected  Though the design is cool, the quality of this earrings set is poor. They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper. I also bought the pendant with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both.  -(I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design. <end>  earrings  These earrings were the perfect size for me...not too small and not too big. I can wear them with jeans or dress up. Love them! <end>  Very heavy  Be aware, these are actually fairly heavy earrings. I find I can't wear them often without discomfort. <end>  great earrings!  Love these earrings, wear them to work and out. The picture doesn't do them justice! <end>  Lovely  These earrings, while a bit smaller than I expected, are delicate and pretty. Perfect with a pretty skirt. <end>  Beautiful  These earrings are beautiful. I've never seen any like these before. Very good quality. <end>  Great value  I am very pleased with these earrings. They are a great quality at this price. I would also recommend the matching pendant. Great set!! <end>  gift  The earrings were such a hit that another daughter wants to buy a pair! <end>  A pleasureful experience  let me just say my girlfriend loved them and then loved me <end>
 B000EG8J44  Sterling Silver Heart Pendant, 18" ||	  heart pendant  Amazon ranks this pendant (today) number 6 in sales so I am very surprised that I am the first to review it. The heart charm is on the small side and is highly polished, very shiny silver which is my favorite finish though I own quite a bit of antiqued silver as well. The snake chain is of high quality and extremely sturdy. The only reason I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am afraid if you are not extra careful, this pendant could scratch easily and you have to worry about not getting fingerprints on it when handling it or putting it on. I will wear this as a pendant but I own several ankle bracelets and am going to use the charm on one of them sometimes as well. So, this item for me will do double duty and I've definitely got my money's worth (I was lucky and bought this pendant in a 60% percent off sale and didn't pay the full price listed.) <end>  I love it!!  I love this necklace. I purchased this for a great price. The chain is strong, the pendant is great. There is one small flaw on one side of it. It is not smooth like it should be. However, I do not wear it so that side shows and I love it!  ) <end>
 B000EGANDE  Sterling Silver Open Circle Drop Earrings ||	  Nice earrings  They are bigger than I thought, but all together they are very nice and it is worth 15$. <end>
 B000EGJUUG  1/8 ct. tw. Diamond Fashion Hoop Earrings in 10K Two-Tone Gold ||	  Diamond earrings  I love these earrings, they were bought as a replacement for a pair that was stolen from me. These are as beautiful as the original ones I owned. Fred Meyer's has excellent customer service, I had a problem with Fed Ex delivery which was promptly solved with one call to Fred Meyer's. <end>
 B000EGM1AW  Child's 1/10 ct. tw. Diamond Stud Earrings in 14K White Gold ||	  Simply beautiful!  I just opened the super cute box and found the little sparkling earrings for my little cutie. They are just awesome! I was expecting them to be very small, but they fit just right on my 21 month old daughter. The diamonds are not that small and are easily noticeable. My daughter lost a pair before so I was looking for a screw-back one this time and found the right one. Very happy with the purchase and planning to buy 1 more pair for my niece.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update  (3/26/2012)I was taking her t-shirt off and the earring split into two....the diamond came off with the cup holding it! I got it repaired from the local jewellery-fix shop but now the quality of the studs stands questionable. <end>  Diamond studs  I love these earrings!!! We received them today and they are small but in my daughter's ears they look big and VERY sparkly. I was afraid that for this price the quality would not be great but boy was I wrong! Buy these for your little girls, you won't regret it! <end>  Great  Looked good on my daughter, had child backing that worked well. My wife lost one, thats why i speak in the past tense  ( <end>  Beautiful!  These earrings are beautiful and perfect for a little girl. We got them for our daughter's 1st birthday since her birthstone is diamond. When they first arrived and I saw them, I couldn't believe how puny they were and wanted to return them, but when I finally decided to put them on her ears, they looked absolutely perfect. The clasp is wonderful and these are the only earrings she has not been able to remove from her ears and lose so far. I would recommend them for an infant girl, but later keep in mind that they will look too small. However, they will make a perfect keepsake that maybe one day she will give to her daughter  ). She has been wearing them since May, 7 months, and they match every outfit. We are really happy about this purchase. <end>
 B000EGO0DI  NFL New England Patriots Tom Brady Dog Tag Sportagz ||	  Positive  Received this order in short amount of time. Item just as pictured. Was very pleased with transaction. <end>
 B000EGPM4Y  Apex Copper Bracelet, Wide Link Size (3/8") ||	  Jason  It Was really nice for about three weeks then it broke. and its been in the drawer ever since. better spend more money and buy one that wont break. <end>  Great bracelet.  As advertised, I dont know if it is the copper bracelet or the magnetic necklace but one of them sure does make the pain go away, I am a firm believer in both, thanks amazon for the great shopping experience. <end>  Better Than Expected  Excellent product. Heavy copper links with sturdy fastener. Couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. <end>  Awesome  I bought the bracelet for looks and not the healing ability. The bracelet is very thick and manly something a little different that what everyone wears. The package says one size fits all but if you're a man with super thick wrists you may be in trouble. I'm a big man and it fits me perfectly. I'm very happy and get lots of compliments on it. <end>  Awesome Bracelet!  I have been shopping around for a good copper bracelet and when I seen this one it was what I was looking for. Just received this bracelet today and I am very impressed with the size and weight of it. It is positively a very masculine bracelet. Pictures of the bracelet do not do it justice.It has nice thick links and is heavy and very stylish. I'm an active person so I want something that would take some abuse. This looks like I will have no problem with it. <end>  Do these work!  I highly recommend buying these if you have any kind of hand ailments. They are not a complete cure, but they sure ease the pain. I always heard copper was good for arthritis, and did some reading on the subject. Since these were not too expensive, I decided to give it a try and purchased two (one for each hand). Give them a try, they do work! <end>  Perfect Copper Link bracelets  I bought these for my arthritis and they are great. Very sturdy links and clasp. The Chain links by themselves are 8.25 inches and 9 inches with clasp. Very well made and they look good too. <end>  Yep, It's a Copper Bracelet  What can I say- it's a copper bracelet! Writing a review on it is like reviewing a pencil- use one end to write, if you make a mistake, use the other end.Buy it if you want an attractive wide-linked copper bracelet- but keep in mind its a one-size fits all kind of deal.For those buying it for health benefits, do these things really work on arthritis pains? Depends on who you ask. I know of only one study that has tested copper bracelets and gotten positive results. A 1976 placebo-controlled study involving 300 people compared copper bracelets to bracelets painted to look copper and found that a significant number of subjects who wore the copper bracelets said they obtained relief (Walker, 1976). This study has not been duplicated by others, so try it- you haven't got much to lose and potentially a lot to gain! Also recommendTreat Your Own Spinal Stenosisif you have arthritis in your back. Good luck! <end>  Generous size, lousy lock  The only thing wrong with this bracelet is that it keeps falling off the wrist. The clip design just opens all the time. They should have thought of something more secure. <end>  Was supposed to arrive between the 16th-21st! ARRIVED THE 13th!  I bought this for my grandpa for his 70th birthday, which is the 14th. It got to his house the 13th even though it was supposed to be deliver between the 16th-21st! He wore one like this for 6 years without ever taking it off (He used pliers to bend the two links together). He lost the original one a while back and says his arm pain is back. He will be so happy. <end>  Very Satisfied  Bracelet has large links and looks great. The only advice that I have is that if you choke the chain up for a smaller size that you remove the extra link. If you don't, the clasp will open and you will loose the chain. I lost my first one. This is my second purchase. Obviously I like it. <end>  Just what I've been looking for!!!  Really nice weight & link size, good for larger guys like me.If you are used to wearing copper, it will tarnish in the first couple of weeks, then it will settle in as part of your second skin.Its hard to find copper bracelets of this quality, so i am delighted with this. Even though the clasp is made of copper, it is really secure, i've put it on & had no issues what so ever, and i'm really active, so it's gettting pulled on all the time.Really great, my wife keeps telling me to buy another one!!! <end>  Works Like a charm  I bought the bracelet because my other one dropped off my wrist while working, it works like a charm.I get a pins and needles feeling in my hands and arms lasting from 5 seconds to 2 or 3 minutes. with the bracelet on I go for days without getting the feeling and when its does occur it is much less. <end>  Cooper Bracelet  This bracelet is exactly like you see in the picture, thick, well-worked metal, is strong, its closure is quite safe, I like it <end>  Don't think this is real copper  Also, the clasp is horrible. I've never seen a clasp like this before. It is difficult to work with and usually works itself open. I should have known from the price it wasn't real copper, but since the title is copper bracelet, not copper look bracelet, I guess I thought lying was false advertising and therefore illegal. What do I know I guess. <end>  Apex copper bracelet.  A very nice bracelet , large size but very easy to remove links. So you can make it to fit comfortably . <end>  Had extra links so you can adjust easily  The clasp was heavy enough and the length was long so you can adjust it. Its discription was right on <end>  PAIN RELIEVER 1  I bought this for my Mom who suffer from stiffness in her knee. She wears it on her ankle and since she has had it she has not suffered anymore.EXQUISITE GIFT BAGS & BASKETS BY "D" <end>  Couldn't want more  If you want to wear copper (it works for me) this bracelrt excels. Solid & secure, no gimmicks just copper. <end>  Copper Bracelet  What can I say? It's a simple, sturdy bracelet... just what I wanted. Can be resized by removing links. Real copper as evidenced by the discoloration of my wrist. The clasp is sturdy and not likely to open accidentally. The links are very shiney when new, then dull with wear... I like that. Has weathered nicely to a subtle dull tone. <end>  Substantial  The bracelet is substantial and has a nice patina. The size is easily adjusted by removing one or more of the links. The clasp is sturdy and I anticipate no problems with it breaking down. I would order one again. I ordered this one after learning that copper is the only metal that is an anti-microbial and I figure any extra help fighting germs can't hurt - especially if it looks good! <end>  copper bracelet  I bought this bracelet for my husband because it was our 22nd anniversary and the gift is to be of copper. Since he has been wearing it he said his knuckle that had been bothering for quite some time now feels better. The bracelet is sized generously so it can fit a large wrist easily. It will be very lose on someone with a smaller wrist. <end>  copper bracelet  My husband was very pleased with this bracelet - it helps to relieve the arthritis pain in his fingers.The speed of delivery to our house was great...and without the expense of special delivery. <end>  I like it  Not much really to say about it, other than I like it. I bought the big one and snipped off a couple of links with side cutter, I wanted it tighter on my wrist. But it has a nice rugged look, copper turns you a little black and green especially when you sweat. But that's ok, it washes off! It also has a sturdy clasp, when I first saw the clasp I thought, aaahh this is junk. But I was wrong, works great and has never came loose or fallen off, and I am very active.I haven't taken it off since I got it a couple months ago, still get that pain in my shoulder but who knows, maybe it healed something I didn't know about it! LMAO But pain relief or not, I like it. <end>  Men's Copper Bracelet  This product is all it claims to be. The quality is top shelf and exactly what I wanted, and a very reasonable price. What more can a person ask for? <end>  Not exactly as I pictured it would be.  I was expecting a finish that wasn't so shiny. It could be coated with something and I was wanting a natural copper bracelet for health reasons. <end>  Nice Copper Bracelet  Very well made, looks good and has a very secure clasp. Does it help my pain(s), maybe.....but it doesn't make it worse either. Good product, at a good price and fast service. It's adjustale too. <end>  No light weight  Bracelet was exactly what I expected . It was a little large so I removed a link. If you order it definitely expect a heavy bracelet this is no light weight. <end>  Big!  if you have tiny wrists you may want to look elsewhere. I do and this will fall off if I'm not careful but I just hike it up on my forearm and its fine. This is well made and heavy duty, more for a man than a woman, but I like it. <end>  good buy  Gave these bracelettes to my brother and my father. Hopefully, they'll work well for them. They seems happy with their gifts. <end>  no tricks  exactly as advertised, nice weight and very nice shine. copper turns skin green, yes people, that happens, it will go away, don't freak out. <end>  He said it works!  I got this for a male with stiff and sore joints especially in the morning. He said that it works great and he feels much better. Also, I like it on him because it looks like regular men's jewelry. <end>  Just right  Very fine bracelet, just what I needed. Looks very good, feels good. Makes a man look like a man. Would make a great gift and price is great. <end>  no effect on aches and pains  Absolutely no effect on aches and pains. I've been wearing it non-stop for a couple weeks and have noticed nothing expcept more pain but can't blame that on this copper bracelet. It looks OK. <end>  Just what she wanted  My daughter wanted this as a replacement for one she lost. She loves wearing it. If it is suppose to be worn for a health benefit I'd say "yeah right" with the utmost sarcasm. Still if you just like a quality made inexpensive copper bracelet that turns your arm green this will do. <end>  Beautiful Copper Bracelet!  Yes the links are 3/8" wide and its 9" long. I and my wife think its really brautiful. OK, mostly I love it! They also covered it with something so it doesnt tarnish! That is my favorite part. I really wouldnt want to have to polish it! <end>  Copper Bracelett  This is an excellent product and if you have aches and pains anywhere in your body, they will vanish. You also might want to add the magnet bracelet, wear them both! <end>

 B000EHI9NE  Sterling Silver Digit Number 7 Pendant 3/4 inch (18 mm) ||	  Inspirational  I bought the pendant to wear during my daughter's softball games. Her number is 7. It is a nice way to show support for my daughter and her team. Other team members have also commented on how much they like the pendant. This is something I can also give to her. There are lots of sports ahead and I hope other numbers will be available. <end>
 B000EHI9Q6  Sterling Silver Digit Number 23 Pendant 3/4 inch (18 mm) ||	  Love it...  I had to buy this twice for my daughter since her number is 23 on her basketball jersey.She lost the first one. She just loves it! Wears it all the time. It's a great size and looks good on. She then bought one for her boyfriend who also plays basketball in another number and looks good on him also and he is 6'4. Very happy customer. <end>  Nice for a girl  My daughter is #23 on her basketball team and wanted a pendant with her number. This was perfect, not too big (as I had worried). It actually looks very nice and was quickly delivered. She was very happy. <end>  Sterling Silver Number "23" Pendant  Pendant was nice, material a bit soft, and chain too thin for a male..but it was still a great purchase and looks very nice. <end>
 B000EHMGFG  Sterling-silver Diamond-cut Nugget Cross with Italian Box-chain ||	  CROSS AND NECKLACE  MY DAUGHTER REALLY LOVES THIS NECKLACE AND CROSS I GOT HER FOR X-MAS VERY PRETTY AND STRONG <end>
 B000EHMQJC  Sterling Silver Digit Number 31 Pendant 3/4 inch (18 mm) ||	  Perfect!  I searched everywhere for specific number charms..found these online. They arrived in two days with express shipping and were perfect. Added a sterling silver chain and they made a great gift. <end>
 B000EHMQVK  Sterling Silver Block Initial Letter L Alphabet Pendant Highly Polished, 3/4 inch tall ||	  Simple & nice  I'm looking for a small 'L' initial pendant & this suits best as its size is compartable to my other small pendants & they look good when worn together. It has some wavy edges & not the boring straight alphabet. <end>
 B000EHXZ38  Sterling Silver Egyptian Ankh Pendant, 1 5/8 inch (42 mm) tall ||	  Beautiful Pendent  This pendent is a wonderful piece of jewelry. The intricate, diamond cut hieroglyphs are a nice detail and catch the light beautifully. The size is perfect, being noticeable without looking gaudy. The bail is large enough to hold various cords, chains and ribbons. This is a solid pendent with good weight to it. The only complaint I have is that the back is "hollow" and dips inwards rather than being totally flat. <end>  An excellent deal  This Ankh is a nice size for a choker or a 30" chain. The bail is good sized, I have had no problem putting it on any number of chains. It looks well made in person. I have had many compliments on it. It is pretty solid too, but not completely. The back does recess slightly. At first I thought it might bother me, but it hasn't at all because it hangs so nicely. I have really enjoyed it. What a bargain too. Enjoy.  ) <end>
 B000EHXZGU  Sterling Silver Jesus Carrying the Cross Pendant, 1 7/8 inch (47 mm) tall ||	  Beautiful  I had been looking for a cross for a long time. When I saw this one I knew it was THE one. I receive compliments whenever I wear it. I am constaly reminded of my faith and wear it daily. <end>  A great buy  This is a great buy. Delivery was quick and boxed well. The pendant itself is great for Lent, it reminds you of the stations of the cross. And how hard the struggle is to carry a cross. <end>  will refer a friend  i love the Jesus on the cross. My husband loved it too. I will refer a friend. The only thing that was wrong with the charm is that I brought a necklas first and the charm looked nice so I decided to get it. When the charm came it did not fit on the chain. If I would had known the mesurement I would have gotten a bigger chain. But don't worry we made it work. THANK YOU! <end>  Absolutely Beautiful  I bought this cross last year, but am just now getting a chance to write a review. I was specifically looking for a cross that was masculine, as a lot of crosses are designed for ladies. I have worn this for about 6 months and have kept it very shiny with a sterling cleaning cloth. It was larger than I was expecting, and that exceeded my expectation's. I had to go buy a sterling silver chain to put the cross on because this piece is so unique and beautiful that you cannot just wear it with just any chain! It certainly is a show piece and has grabbed the attention of many people when they see me wearing it. It also is something I wear to represent my faith! I have NOT recommended this piece to any of my friends because I simple do not want anyone wearing it but me HAHA, that is how unique this piece is. You just cannot find this cross in any ordinary jewelry store. I think this was my best AND favorite piece I have ever purchased. I personally wear this with a 30" sterling silver chain! The only con I can think of is that it does have to be cleaned often (only because I wear it so much and it stays on me in the shower) but overall YES I would recommend this to anyone debating on buying it..Unfortunately as of now 5/14/12 it is no available. 10 STARS! <end>  Beautiful  When it arrived i was so happy with it. I am buying them for Chrismas gifts for my Christian friend. I would recommend this to anyone of Faith. Trully beautiful. Carla Rhomberg <end>  Love It  I purchased this cross several months ago on Amazon. This is a beautiful pendant to honor your faith. I wear it on a 24 or 30 inch silver rope chain and have received many compliments. The only negative I have is with the size of the bale which is extremely large, if it was cut down to half it's size, then I would have rated it 5 stars and perfect. <end>  A Gift Loved Dearly  I bought this charm for my boyfriend on our 1 year anniversary. He is 100 miles away from me and its a struggle at times, OMG....he loved it so much. He told me just the other day, baby I where my necklace everyday and I kiss it twice in the morning....once for the man on it and again for you. This charm is a very great buy and I would recommend it to everyone.....Sterling Silver 1 7/8" (47 mm) Diamond Cut Jesus Carrying the Cross Pendant <end>

 B000EHY4B0  Sterling Silver Walking Turtle Pendant, 1 1/8 inch tall ||	  DISAPPOINTMENT  I bought this for my boyfriend, because he loves turtles. It is a unique piece and I like the creativity that went into it. However, the size is so small. It truly would be beautiful if it wasn't so small and it's my fault for not reading. It's a shame though that pictures of items sold online are enlarged to look bigger. The title on this should be  Small Sterling Walking Turtle Pendant. Anyway, please read the description on this before purchase. <end>  very pleased  This was a hit with my daughter who loves turtles.....she wears it everyday......it was a great christmas gift and of good quality. <end>

 B000EI02IS  Sterling Silver Cross Pendant, 2 1/4 inch (57 mm) tall ||	  BUYER BEWARE!!!  False advertisement! Buyer beware! I returned this cross as soon as it arrived to my home. The front is cool but their is absolutley NOTHING on the other side! I can't even say that it is hollow because their is nothing behind it. If I wanted ghetto bootleg shell-jewelry, i would've went to the ghetto! This cross pendant is also OVER PRICED. I've always gave good reviews with Amazon except for this one. <end>
 B000EI05RQ  Sterling Silver M-16 Rifle Pendant, 7/8 inch (22 mm) tall ||	  WOW........  The quality of the item was fabulous. I was just amazed at the detail and size of the charm. The price was great for the item. I will deffinatly be shopping this store again and again. shipping was fast and I got the product in no time. But I can't stress how good the quality is of the merchandise. <end>  Sterling Silver Large Diamond Cut Gun (M16) Pendant  -Came faster than i thought.- fabulous quality- nice size- great details-decent priceoct 29 07 was the first time i wore it (day after i got it) and i was complemented on it many times. <end>  weird  the pendant was off. did not meet our expectations. measurements were off. sent it right back. will not purchase from this vendor again <end>
 B000EI05SU  Sterling Silver Runner Pendant, 2 3/16 inch (55 mm) tall ||	  Nice but big!!  I ordered this product and made the mistake of not really reading the description (I was just excited to actually find a runner pendant)...when it arrived, it was way too big for what I was looking for (a gift for a teenage girl)....it was more like 2" and more of a 'bling bling' size. I ended up getting their smaller version and returning this one, but if you're looking for a more sizable pendant, this would work very well for you. Great quality and nicely boxed. They were also very speedy with getting the smaller one to me and processing the credit to my account. Definitely recommend this company! <end>

 B000EI232Q  Sterling Silver Madonna & Child Medal, Made in Italy. 3/4 inch (19 mm) Tall ||	  Lacks definition  I ordered this madonna for a Christmas gift. Beautiful but it lacks definition. The size of the medal is good and the bail isbig and permits to wear it on a bigger chain or a silk cord, with is beautiful. Medal arrived before due date and in good condition. <end>
 B000EI9EAA  Aquamarine and Diamond Fashion Earrings in 14K White Gold ||	  Great earrings!  I bought both the necklace and the earrings of this set to match the ring given to me as a gift.

 B000EIEIW4  Sterling Silver Large Egyptian Ankh Pendant, 2 1 inch ||	  pretty but big  this is a nice ankh if you don't want a big one this one is not for you,however the silver is pretty and a good weight,it is not double sided.The chain is to thin for a big cross like this.having said all of this it is worth the money and it look good. <end>  Nice piece, but too large  I received this product as a gift from my Wish List. The piece is beautiful. The detailing is really nice. But the piece is quite big and is much too large to be a necklace charm. We had to return the piece. However, I would purchase from this seller again, but will be sure to check the dimensions of the piece before purchasing. <end>
 B000EIEIWE  Sterling Silver Large Egyptian Ankh Pendant, 1 1/4 inch ||	  Almost Embarrassed To Wear  The picture above is much nicer than the product in actuality. It's a good size and the front of it looks fine, but the backside isn't flat. It's concave, which gives it a very cheap look. I am very disappointed. I looked forward to wearing it too much. Now I'll need to find one that looks better. The other products I received from Sabrina Silver I'll rate much higher though. <end>  Beautiful gift at an excellent price  As one reviewer mentioned, the backside of this ankh is hollow (but who looks at the back?) I added two pictures so you can see the front and back. I think it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. It's a nice size and weight, comes with an 18" silver chain, in a nice small silver cardboard box. It is definitely a great value. It took exactly 7 days to arrive. Very satisfied. <end>  ankh  This silver ankh was a gift and the pendant was great but the necklace was too short for a large man's neck. <end>  awesome  BEAUTIFUL, LOVED IT SO MUCH, HAD TO GET ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER.WEAR IT EVERY DAY..... <end>  Love It!  I got this as a birthday present for my boyfriend and he loves it. The price was great and it's looks really nice. The chain was really short but I had planned on getting a different one anyway. <end>
 B000EIGIVS  Sterling Silver Cross Pendant, 1 1/2 inch ||	  a review  Im very pleased with the pendant itself. But the chain was a let down. But i guess with price comparisons it is a good buy. <end>
 B000EIGJIA  Sterling Silver Goose Pendant, 1 inch Tall ||	  LOVE THIS.  I bought this as an x-mas gift for my fiance as a cute inside thing between us. Ive been calling him my goose since we started dating so he really loved this. <end>  Holy Goose!  I love this goose. I got it for my wife and she adores it as much as she adores me (now).

 B000EIGK16  Sterling Silver Jesus Pendant, 3/4 inch ||	  Sterling Silver Jesus Pendant, 3/4 inch  It is just what it appears to be and it gives me comfort. You will want to purchase another chain however. <end>
 B000EIICAS  Sterling Silver Mariner's Cross Pendant, 1 1/16 inch ||	  Beautiful  I had searched long and hard for something that looked good, but wasn't too costly. I received it in less than a week and was rather pleased with my purchase. It is even more beautiful than it appears on screen. <end>  Poor Quality and No Chain  I had to return this pendant because the quality was very poor. The photo makes it appear to be made of thick and heavy silver, but it is actually thin and cheap. I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it. WARNING  I was led to believe that it came with a chain because of the photo, but the product description does claim that the chain is not included. I would stay away from this product. They did return my money, but I had to pay the return shipping. <end>
 B000EJCXMA  Sterling Silver Recovery Pendant, 3/4 inch Tall ||	  Good item; cheap chain!  I enjoyed receiving this item and wearing it immediately. However, on the second day, the chain just fell apart. Don't know why or whatever, but one minute it is around my neck and the next it is on the ground. I am buying a new chain and the medallion is what I made this purchase for so still and all I just glad I didn't lose the medallion. <end>  Good Quality at a Great Price  The sterling silver recovery pendant has a great shine and the chain is sturdy, yet looks delicate. I've received many compliments on my pendant. The pendant is faceted so it reflects the light quite nicely. Usually you gey what you pay for, but this pendant looks like you spent much more. <end>
 B000EJEKLW  Sterling Silver Cat Pendant, 1 1/4 inch ||	  Beautiful Little Feline Spirit!  I love my little silver cat! She is even prettier than the picture shows. Nice and thick silver! Good size, perfect for a pendant. I love the way it shines and the little diamond cuts. This delicate, refined little cat also shows a bit of mystery and whimsy combined. Also, a great cat pendant for Halloween jewelery. You will not be disappointed! Make this "feline friend" yours today! <end>
 B000EJEKY4  Sterling Silver Shark Pendant, 1 inch Tall ||	  Shark Necklace  Sterling Silver 1 in. (25 mm) Tall Shark PendantMy daughter saw a shark necklace in Oprah magazine that sold for $125.00.

She loves it. <end>  shark pendant  Well this is great. it's what i wanted. chain is 18 inch. great if you like shark pendant. <end>
 B000EJEL48  Sterling Silver Pendant, 1/2 inch Tall ||	  Not happy  I received the pendant today. Was not happy with what I got at all. The one in the picture shows markings around the circle. The one sent was just plain..... This is a present for my daughter am so glad it came here first and not to her. <end>  Looks good  This pendant is good looking and came just as advertised. It would have been nice of the company to have put each of the seven pedants, which I bought at same time, in separate gift boxes rather that shipping all seven in the same gift box. They must have thought I was going to give them all to the same person. <end>  It's life changing  I first received this neclace as a present on my third day in NA, which also happened to be my birthday. This neclace helped keep my clean for my first 30 days buy reminding me that there are people in the NA family who do care about me. Now I have gotten one for my sponsor as a thank you gift and I am sure she will love it as much as I do. If you or someone you know is in NA and working hard to stay clean and sober, I recommend getting this neclace. It means so much more than you will ever know without it. <end>
 B000EJELES  Sterling Silver Gun Pendant, 1 1/16 inch Tall ||	  Good  Great little gift. Does not actually fire ammunition. This would be considered a plus in most situations. For instance, my girlfriend's son tries to shoot his mom with it consistently. His attempts are thwarted by the pendant's inability to fire ammunition. <end>
 B000EJEMLA  Sterling Silver Large Filigree Guitar Pendant, 1 3/4 inch Tall ||	  First Order from Sabrina Siver  I am extremely excited about this purchase!! The product came in very quickly.

 B000EJGE0W  Sterling Silver Penguin Pendant, 1 inch Tall ||	  not as shown  very nice item great shipping speed just too bad it said that the chain was 18 inch chain and was shiped with a 16 inch chain instead. i guess this is buyer beware. but like i said very nice cant be worn but still very nice to look at. <end>

 B000EJI64Y  Sterling Silver Whale Pendant, 1 inch Tall ||	  Very pretty  Looks a lot more expensive than it does in the picture. I took a class on the biology of whales and fell in love with these amazing creatures. This necklace definitely gives people an insight as to who I am and many people in the science department ask about my love for whales when I wear it. Thank you. <end>
 B000EJI65S  Sterling Silver Clam Shell Pendant, 3/8 inch Tall ||	  Clam Necklace  This necklace is very pretty. It came on time and it is very cute! <end>
 B000EJI6D0  Sterling Silver Sun Pendant, 7/8 inch Tall ||	  Absolutely love it  I have been looking for nice sun charm for months, and finally found this one. It was exactly what I was looking for. Not too small, big, plain, or extravagant. Something I would wear. The piece is beautifully detailed, and the little indentations in the suns rays adds a little something to the appearance of the piece. This image does not do it justice. The chain provided is way too small, but that's a minor problem. I am very happy with it. <end>
 B000EJUQHE  Lapis Greek Key Capped "Fortune" Squared Pendant, 14k Gold ||	  A bit disappointed  Much smaller than I anticipated (I should have read the description more carefully). Also, less substantial and less detailed than expected. Pretty but not really worth the price ($45) <end>
 B000EJVVZK  Red Jade Sole Leaf Pendant, 14k Gold ||	  Very Small  Overall, it's a beautiful little pendant. That being said, it is... little. Based off of the measurements, I had expected something a little more substantial. I will keep it as it is too late to return for something else. <end>

 B000ELH3P0  14kt White Gold Claddaugh Cross - D1522 ||	  Beautiful!!!  Bought it for my partner and he has had literally dozens of compliments on it. It's a bit large, so better for a man. The workmanship is wonderful and the white gold adds class to it all. <end>
 B000EMJZYQ  Sterling Silver Block Initial Letter G Alphabet Charm with CZ Stones, for use with 8 mm Flat Rubber Bracelets ||	  A lot of cool for a little price  I bought one of these for a 10 year old girl with an extra initial, but of course you could spell out words, by for a mom with kids initials, make an ID bracelet, whatever. Excellent price, very chic, great service from this seller, but remember, you just get the initial so you have to contact them for the bracelet, etc. But well worth it. <end>
 B000EMM4BC  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Block Initial Letter P Alphabet Pendant, 1 5/8 inch ||	  Sterling Silver Large Initial Neclace  My daughter is very happy with this item and wears it often. She is 15. <end>
 B000EMW38G  14k White Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/2ctw, VS2, G-H) ||	  Junk  I have purchased jewelry from Amazon.com in the past and been very satisfied, but these earrings were junk! I purchased them as a birthday present for my wife, and when she took the earrings out, the "gold" on the posts flaked right off, revealing black metal underneath.To add insult to injury, as I made the purchase a little over a month before her birthday, Amazon charged me a 20% restocking fee. I suppose I should be grateful - they originally weren't going to take them back at all, but as they were defective, they decided to only charge me $95.40 for the privilege of returning their defective product and ruining my wife's birthday. Thanks, Amazon! <end>
 B000ENPE5Y  Viatek Stain Doctor Portable Ultrasonic Stain Remover with Jewelry/Glasses Cleaning Case ||	  Not worth it, doesn't live up to the hype!  I have yet to figure out if this thing is actually on and working. The light is red when turned on but there is no sound, motion in the water or any indication that something is happening. I tried to remove fresh stains off clothing without success. I tried to clean a diamond ring and the inside of the diamond still looked dirty after more than the recommended time and combination soap/water stated. I bought this to avoid getting a big jewelry cleaner and for the fact that it is supposed to remove stains but it doesn't live up to the hype.

 B000EOFIB8  France - National Lapel Pin ||	  France Pin  This product is exactly what I was looking for. Just the right size to match the other pins I already own. <end>
 B000EOHES8  Virginia - State Friendship Pin ||	  Great pin!  I ordered this pin for my father to put on his motorcycle jacket. It's well made for the price and looks like the photo, but much clearer (as the photo is a little pixely/blurry). <end>
 B000EOHHFS  Russia - National Lapel Pins ||	  Nice quality pin  Nice quality workmanship (enameling stayed within metal boundaries. Rich, vibrant colors. Order fulfilled with prompt shipping. Will continue to purchase lapel pins as the need arises. <end>
 B000EOHHNU  Syria - National Lapel Pin ||	  Love the flags  Needed to show my support for Syria. This is just one way to do that. This is a good product and the delivery was really. <end>
 B000EOHHS0  USA - National Lapel Pins ||	  Its ok.  The pin itself appears to be in pretty good condition for a cheap price. However, the pin is Made in China. I thought it was Made in USA because the company is in Colorado, but I was wrong and I am not happy about it. <end>
 B000EOJF1C  Czech Republic - Friendship Pin ||	  Far Better Quality Than the Photo Shows!  I've always wanted a pin like this to place on my jacket, for my frequent travels to the Czech Republic. The pin looked cheap in the photo, but I figured "what the heck?" The price is cheap, so a tacky pin may be better than no pin, (or maybe not!).Imagine my surprise, when just a couple days later the pin arrived, well padded, and is absolutely beautiful!The colors are gorgeous, and vividly produced, set beautifully in a gold inlay. Between each stripe, and color section, are ultra-thin metallic gold lines to set the colors perfectly apart. The pin itself has some actual weight to it and seems pretty solid, and has a high quality butterfly clip for pinning it on. (They are very easy to use, and hold the pin to the cloth or leather well).I just couldn't be more surprised and pleased with the quality and spectacular classy look of this pin, and I would feel very proud to wear it. I've ordered 4 more for friends! <end>
 B000EOL9CK  Japan - Friendship Pin ||	  Looks great  Not much to review - I ordered and received the pin quickly. I've never had a problem with Flagline. The pin is of good quality. <end>

 B000EOLX76  Sterling Silver 1 Carat size Brilliant Cut Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Bridal Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  Beautiful Ring  This ring is very pretty. however you get what u pay for. The cubic z looks really fake on it. The ring itself is well built and sturdy. The top part of the ring digs into my knuckles. But overall, I really like the ring <end>
 B000EOLXV2  Sterling Silver .23 Carat Size Brilliant Cut Cubic Zirconia Bridal Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  not bad...  pros  cute and cheap!cons  cheap is a cheap does; the band bends with the slightest pressure, and the sizing is a little off; i wear a 6 and this ring slides around on my finger. <end>  Sweet little ring  This is a very sweet and pretty ring. Because of the bezel setting and clean/curved lines, the ring has a somewhat modern, but very appealing, look. The czs sparkle and so does the silver setting. I'm really enjoying this ring! <end>  Stunning ring!  I rec'd this ring last week and I LOVE it. It's a nice, simple, elegant style. Also, somewhat sporty, which fits my lifestyle. I never take it off. The price is also unbelievable. If you are looking for high quality jewelry, I highly reccomend this ring! <end>
 B000EOLY8Y  Sterling Silver 1 Carat size Princess Cut Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Bridal Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  Still tarnish free!  I LOVE this ring. It's been months since I got it and it hasn't chipped or tarnished and it still sparkles. I am really rough on jewelry and this ring has lasted way longer than many others. Great value. <end>
 B000EOMKMS  Sterling Silver .40 Carat Size Princess Cut Emerald Colored CZ Solitaire Bridal Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  not worth it.  beautiful ring but the band bent and the stone fell out. also dryed my skin out and left a hard callus on finger. <end>  INSIDE of ring dingy  This is a sweet little ring that is very attractive, esp. worn w/an eternity band of emeralds, BUT, the inside of my ring is brown, gold color. Not sure if this is tarnish??? or faded paint. Kinda makes me wonder if this is sterling silver????? It doesn't come clean, but at least its on the inside. Doubt I will purchase from this vendor again. Sorry. <end>  simple, subtle, and modern  I love simple jewelry, this one is simple and very streamline/modern. The ring looks just like it is in the picture. The color of the small emerald colored CZ is also very pretty. <end>  CZ looks better than some real Emeralds  I've been looking for an Emerald for several years and the stones are so washed out. So I started looking at CZ's or any other fake Emeralds. They cost hundreds, usually the same as a real stone. I was pleased when I came across this ring. It's a small stone but it looks good. <end>
 B000EOOHKQ  Sterling Silver 3.0 Carat Size Emerald Cut Cubic Zirconia Men's Solitaire Ring (Available in Sizes 8 to 13) ||	  Ring  This ring is beautiful. The person that I purchased it for is so happy with it. He has gotten so many compliments on the size of the zirconia and the price was fabulous. We will be shopping with the seller again. The shipment was so fast. We are very happy with the product. Thank you. <end>  Beautiful Ring  The Ring is beautiful - this includes the stone - I have real flawless diamonds, which i never wear, for fear of losing a stone. This fake stone has fewer facets than my real ones but, it is still a very nice looking stone.I am very pleased with my purchase. <end>  Stunner  Great ring for the money looks real! Awesome cut, fit, finish. Very good CZ. Nice mounting. Highly recommend it. <end>  Great Ring  This ring is defiantly worth the money. This ring has weight and stone is of great quality. The only thing I have to say about the stone is that yes the stone is in an emerald cut stone... but it's not a true emerald stone... it's actually a radiant cut emerald stone... it's a big difference if you are looking for something particular. I was hoping for a true emerald cut stone but I am going to keep it because it really is a great ring. <end>  Head-turner  I bought this ring last year and it is a total head-turner! The stone is not dead and glossy in the least! It's brilliant, bright and seems in constant movement with the facets catching light and twinkling. The sterling requires only an occasional polish. This one's a definite keeper! Also, excellent seller in every way. <end>  Nice mounting , ugly stone  Seller has very fast delivery, The rings mounting is substantial and finished flawlessly, However I am dissapointed in the quality of the stone, it's dead and glassy looking. I've seen CZ's that are nearly indistinguishable from real diamonds, but this is not in the same leauge....it looks totaly fake <end>  Beautiful  The ring is beautiful. It demonstrates that sterling silver WITHOUT platinum,rhodium, nickel plating is by far the best choice. The silver shines with a beautiful soft white shine. The stone is a little less brilliant than the very best CZ, maybe because of the cut, and it has less fire (you see more blue than anything else), but it is still very good, and in bright daylight it dazzles. I am very happy with the ring and would recommend Sabrina sterling to everyone. <end>  Beautiful !  This is a good looking ring. The stone is large and most may think it is a fake, but I say so what?...The stone is gorgeous, and that's why I bought it. Put it in the sunlight and it dazzels! I wanted the beauty of a diamond knowing that I couldn't afford one....this did not dissapoint. <end>  great ring for the price  i like all about this ring ;considering the priceits excellanttksBENNY <end>

I have big hands (size 10) and it looks amazing! The main stone (center) is great in size, not too small and not too big and you can see it from distance. My boyfriend gave it to me today and I'm so exited. This ring is a provisional ring but is so beautiful that I cant get my eyes from it. The seller was great and the ring arrived one day later than expected. Great seller and ring. DefinitelyHermosa sortija tama&ntilde;o 10. Se ve hermosa, la piedra no es ni muy grande ni muy pequena esta perfecta y se nota a distancia. Buena sortija si la quieres como una provisional en lo que compras una de mayor valor. Mi novio me la regalo como anillo de compromiso provisional y esta hermosa!! me encanto! La recomiendo para personas con manos grandes pues no se ve la piedra peque&ntilde;a. Muy buen vendedor, lo recomiendo. La sortija llego un dia antes de cumplirse la semana. <end>
 B000EOQN4E  Sterling Silver .40 Carat Size Princess Cut Sapphire Colored CZ Solitaire Bridal Ring (Available in Sizes 6 to 10) ||	  Just what I was looking for  The ring I bought was exactly what I was looking for. It was simple and the price was very reasonable. It arrived at my house before the Amazon order I put in on the same day. I couldn't have asked for better, more prompt service. <end>  Beautiful Stone  The stone in the middle is very pretty and the service was great with very quick shipping. The .40 carat sterling silver band looks a little cheap, but what do you expect. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. <end>  Just what it looks like it will be  I still haven't figured out how this company offers these rings with decent stones at these prices. This ring, although having a darker "sapphire" than expected, is just what I wanted. <end>
 B000EOSG8U  Platinum, Princess-Cut, Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/3 cttw, G-H Color, VS2 Clarity) ||	  Perfect sparklers  Ordered these and a round cut for Christmas presents for my older daughters. They are a perfect size. Yes, they are small. Slightly larger than uncooked barley. However, they present well on the ear. There is no question they are the real deal. The stones have a nice color and sparkle with fire under the lights. There is a good metal presence. Not flimsy. I actually considered ordering a pair for myself! Would recommend. <end>  Nice for the price  These arrived quickly, and they were a great deal. They seem to be good quality, but since I'm not a jeweler what do I know? The only thing that I wish was different about them is the backing (which is why I only gave them 4 stars) - it would be better if they had a screw-on backing rather than the friction backing. It makes me a little nervous to think that the only thing keeping the backing on my earring is a little groove to stop the slide. <end>
 B000EOW9OW  Platinum, Round, Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/2 cttw, G-H Color, VS2 Clarity) ||	  Cheap looking, no certificate/COA  These are very cheap looking earrings. There was no COA/certificate which, on a ~$1,000 diamond pair of earrings seems very strange to me. The clasp on the pair I received was bent, and the prong on the other earring was actually slightly crooked. The diamonds didn't look like G-H near colorless to my eyes as they seemed to have a yellowish tint, but I'm no grader so I can't take that part as too much of a negative. Of course, that is part of the problem -- there's absolutely nothing that states what these earrings are or that they are in fact VS2 grade. There is no certificate, no IGI, not even a basic COA. (There's also no hallmark on the earrings -- I guess because they are too small? Which means they could even be white gold and cubics...)Overall though, they just look and feel cheap -- and that's the real problem. I returned mine. <end>  Rip off!!  bought these in 2009. My wife started to have an allergic reaction to them. took them to a jeweler to replace the posts. they promptly told me that they were cubic zirchromium on a base metal posts. This is a high-end professional company. They tried to keep it quiet in the store because I was pretty upset that I paid this much for paste! <end>

 B000ER1ZMQ  Pugster 925 Sterling Silver Dinosaur Tooth Scoop Neck Stainless Steel Necklaces Pendant For Men ||	  REVIEW  The Pendant Is Indeed Made Of Stainless Steel, No Doubt About It. But Judging By The Picture, I Would Expected That The Necklace It Self Would't Be Made Out Of Rubber. I Don't know, Maybe I Need To Change My Glasses, Or Maybe You Just Need To Change The Picture. Ether Way, I Don't Want To Return The Item, and I Don't need A Refund, Because It Ain't Such A big Deal. And Who Knows, Maybe We Will Make Better Next Time... <end>
 B000ERAV0I  Oval Flying Spaghetti Monster Pendant - antique-gold finish ||	  Failed to read dimensions  Just know that this is only one inch. It is way too small to be a pendant. Will only fit the chain they give you. Good for a small child I guess. Totally my fault for not reading what was clearly stated. That being said, its makes an ok expensive key ring chachski. <end>

 B000ES0044  Sterling Silver Small Bali Hoop Earrings, 5/8" diameter ||	  BEST EARRINGS  These earrings are great!! Great quality, shipped quickly - perfect size for any earring hole (front or later). <end>  Too hard for daughter to use  I bought these as a gift for my teenage daughter. The clips are very difficult for her to open and put in her ears; therefore, she has never worn them. <end>
 B000ES00LW  Sterling Silver Diamond Cut Hoop Earrings, 9/16" Diameter ||	  very nice  These are attractive and a nice size for someone who likes to put earrings in and leave them in for a while. I will say they are diffiult to get on- closing the wire is difficult- took me twice as long to do that as it did to open the package, pull out the earrings and put them in my ears. BUT hopefully that means they will stay put well. For the one day I've worn them, i can say I'm glad of the purchase. <end>
 B000ES17DM  Sterling Silver Oval Bali Hoop Earrings, 13/16" (21 mm) ||	  great service  i was sent the wrong earrings first. but when i brought this to their attention, they sent the correct pair the next dayI am very pleased <end>
 B000ES17F0  Sterling Silver Italian 3mm Tube Long Oval Italian Hoop Earrings ||	  GORGEOUS EARRINGS, NOT TOO HEAVY...THE PERFECT SIZE!  I love these earrings. I was wearing another pair but they were so heavy it actually hurt to wear them. I started looking for a nice pair of silver hoops but wanted something a little different, these are exactly what I was looking for. Even better, they are not too heavy, not too long but not a simple 1" hoop. MOST IMPORTANT...YOU WILL NOT LOSE THESE EARRINGS NOR WILL THEY FALL OFF, THEY LOCK DOWN SO WELL AND ARE QUALITY CRAFTED. I could not have been happier. Thanks so much for providing such awesome products at affordable prices!! <end>  Very Happy  I am very happy with these earrings. They are well made and make a statement when you wear them. <end>  The clasps don't hold well  I think I have owned these earrings for 4 weeks and I just lost one of them yesterday. I do love the oval shape and I received compliments on them. One earring the clasp was super tight and the other popped up and down very easily. I looked at it to see if I could tighten it, but there is no way to do it. If you get two earrings with super tight clasps, then your good to go! <end>
 B000ES1RAA  14k Yellow Gold Ankh Pendant, 18" ||	  Don't waste your time....  I ordered this item and received a gold cross instead. Returned it for a replacement of the correct item and received the same exact cross again. Canceled the order and am now waiting on a refund. I will write again if the wait for refund takes longer than it should. <end>  Very Cute!  Received very quickly. Very cute. Pairing it with a gold cartouche. very cool. <end>
 B000ES4WSY  Sterling Silver Small Bali Hoop Earrings, 1/2" diameter ||	  Bali Hoop Earrings  I was really looking forward to receiving these earrings, but was very disappointed when I received them. Although they were pretty to look at, functionally they were useless. The sterling silver they are made from seems very flimsy and they have NO latch on them, which means you have to force them open to try to get them on. I had to return them because I was worried I would break them trying to put them on. It's a shame, because they looked so nice. One earring was also slightly larger than the other. <end>
 B000ES4WTS  Sterling Silver Bali Hoop Earrings, 5/8" Diameter ||	  perfect gift  If you love silver then you should love these earrings. The texture gives them an exotic effect. The earrings were smaller than I expected but my daughter still loves them and wears them often. <end>  silver earrings  I was not happy when I received these earrings as they are too small to handle with acrylic nails. If I had made it to the postoffice they would have sent them back. <end>

 B000ESO32E  Amazon.com  Black Hills Gold Slider Necklace  Clothing ||	  Tasteful and graceful  The length of this necklace falls in good proportion to a typical V-neck sweater. The green and pink gold of the leaf motif slider provide interesting and enjoyable contrast to the bright, yellow gold of the necklace without overwhelming it or looking tawdry. The overall effect of the piece is mature, tasteful and and noticable without being overstated. <end>
 B000ET65D8  Quarztite and garnet choker, 'Red Bouquet' ||	  Beautiful!!  I love this choker! It's elegant, good quality, I love how it has no clasp it simply spirals around my neck so that means it's very adjustable and stays a choker no matter how I move. It doesn't slide around. I got several comments on it when I wore it. I plan on buying more like this and from this company. <end>
 B000ET7EFG  Bracelet, 'Blue Sky' 0.4" W 8.5" L ||	  stone color is different but get a cute case  First, it is shipped from India but not Brazil.the color of the stone is different from the above figure, which is more brilliant. and the silver part had really some dust between the gap. need to be cleaned if you want to make it look as good as shown in picture.the good thing is , I got a pretty cute case with this bracelet, which will make it more decent as a gift.shipping is fast, and trackable. <end>

 B000ETJBSE  Sterling Silver Script Initial Letter D Alphabet Pendant Flawless Polish, 1 1/2 inch long ||	  Everyday beautiful  I was just looking for a nice piece signature jewelry for everyday wear that I wouldn't get sick over if I happened to lose accidentally, but I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. The picture of this pendant doesn't do it justice, it's a decent size and weight with a nice polished glow that doesn't scream "cheap" or "juvenile" just because it's inexpensive silver. I paired it with a nice silver chain, and it's perfect for casual wear. It's nice enough that I would give this as a gift or part of a gift (such as a stocking stuffer.) <end>
 B000ETY7IS  .70 cttw Princess Cut Channel Set 14k Yellow Gold Wedding Band (H-I Color, SI1-SI2 Clarity), Size 4.5 ||	  received broken - returned  Overall, a very nice ring except for the broken piece of gold underneath the diamonds. Hard to explain but there are little bars that run underneath the diamonds and one was broken. Funny thing was there was a pen or ink mark on each side of the defect, as if somebody had seen it before. Very disappointed that amazon would send something like this out. Obviously we returned it. <end>  Beautiful ring  I love this ring. It was such a good deal and looks great with my wedding ring. <end>

I have this on the middle shelf of my book case. It is everything I thought it would be. Two thumbs up. <end>  Beautiful, Elegant Box  This is a beautiful box. I've had it for a couple of years. I would have given it 5 stars except that I don't approve of their 7 day return policy. Although I didn't need to return it, it's a matter of principle. In the U.S., the standard is 30 days--many businesses offer a longer period. If this doesn't bother you, then I recommend it. It's an elegant glass box with a vintage look. <end>  jewelry box  i order this and had it sent to my grand daughter in VG for christmas and it was broken. she lost the paper work. so we lost our money. <end>
 B000EVKCOE  Sterling Silver Amy Brown Vines Fairy Faerie Pendant with 18" Necklace ||	  xmas gift for a girlfriend  The pendant was bigger than I expected (its a good thing). I was scared that it might have broken during shipping, but the pendant is a lot stronger than it looks. The detail is good, better than on the picture. I was not sure about the faerie, but my girlfriend picked it, and she loved it! My favourite is actually the chain that came with it, and the little black pouch. The silvers all went well together.All in all, a nice item for a partner, even if they are over 20. <end>  Gorgeous pendant  I didn't buy this from Silver Insanity, but from an ebay vendor. It looks gorgeous on a black organza ribbon necklace, I highly recommend wearing it on one. The detail is absolutely painstakingly intricate, and looks just like Amy Brown's paintings. I love the size of it, because it isn't too big or two small. Just the right size for such a beautiful fairy. I myself was a little scared it won't look good, but believe me it does and is oxidized to show off all of the intricate lines. Solid silver and I have had it for months with absolutely no tarnishing. Any oxidation is just adding to its already beautiful state. <end>  Excellent product and fast, excellent seller!  I was very happy about the quality of the pendant and necklace. Mostly, I am surprised at the speed in which I received the pendant and necklace! I received in 4 days including a weekend! I will buy from Silver Insanity again! <end>
 B000EVM8LO  14k White Gold Diamond Floating Heart Pendant (1/2 cttw, I1 Clarity, H-I Color) ||	  She loves it!  My girlfriend wears it every day! It is perfect size, and I compared it to what blue nile has under a microscope, and it has better quality diamonds! Great quality at an unbeatable price. <end>
 B000EVQWU2  10K Yellow Gold 0.12 ct. Diamond Cross Bracelet (8") ||	  Great bracelet, slow delivery  My wife loves the bracelet but I was disappointed in how long it took to receive it. <end>
 B000EVT0IS  10K White Gold 1/2 ct. Diamond Tennis Bracelet ||	  Versatile Bracelet  I picked out this bracelet for my 25th anniversary. I wanted something with diamonds, although these are pretty small. I like that it looks good with both casual and more formal outfits. I would have preferred if it were a little longer. Also, I've had to repair the clasp, which didn't seem to be too strong. It was bent out of shape. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the product for the money. <end>
 B000EW759S  Sterling Silver Blue Crystal 27mm Star Pendant Charm Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  blue star  pretty but not as impressive as the clear star which had better and brighter color. <end>  A fisrt for everything  The perfect gift right? Well I gave it to my girlfriend as a present and 10 days later the top cracked off and it fell off the necklace. The reason I have not put a lower rating is because I got a call about it a few days later offering a refund or exchange. By then I had already ordered another pendant, but she said it was the first time that has ever happened. I could maybe believe that but I still feel people need to know that at least one did break. <end>  Star Pendant  This product is perfect, great quilty! I have ordered serveral other items like this from somebody else for a lot more money and they are not as nice! Great service love the blue star pendant, love Gem Avenue products! <end>  I Love the Blue Star Crystal  There was a small mix up with the shipping date, but customer service was awesome and I got the pendant exactly when they said I would <end>
 B000EW92VM  Blue Topaz Emerald Cut Cubic Zirconia Sterling Silver Stud Post Earrings Pendant Set ||	  very gooood  my girlfriend picked this out,looking at it before she bought it,it looked smallll,boy how we were wrong,it is of nice size and looks very good,the only complaint though is that it should of come with a chain <end>  BEAUTIFUL!!! (The picture is correct - they are amethyst not blue topaz)  Love them!Just what I like in a stone - clear enough to see the color vividly, but the emerald cut makes lots of sparkle, and, it prevents you from seeing all the way through the stone - which gives the impression of looking into deep, deep water - lovely.The earrings are a bit on the heavy side and hang down so they can't be seen. I used bullet clutch earring backs to prop them up so I could see the stones. (Amazon has bullet clutch backs - they make lots of earrings look better by propping them up nicely).The picture is accurate - they are amethyst not blue topaz. <end>
 B000EWJOFG  Turquoise Disc Dangle Earrings ||	  very pretty earrings !  Gave these earring as a gift , and it was loved . Earring looks great on all skin tone . <end>  Great Value  I bought these as a Christmas gift for a friend, and wished I could've kept them for myself. My friend loved them as well. Beautiful and a great value. <end>
 B000EWMKCA  Sterling Silver Clear Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  DIAMONDS  LOVE YOUR CRYSTAL JEWELRY!!! THESE WERE PERFECT WITH JEANS OR DRESS UP. SUN/LIGHT MAKES THEM SHINE LIKE DIAMONDS. <end>  Beautiful earrings!  These are beautiful earrings that I wear constantly. They go with everything and I get lots of compliments. <end>  Swarovski Crystal Sterling Earrings  My husband and I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift to my grandmother. She absolutely LOVED them. <end>  Swarovski Earring - Gorgeous!!!!  I had purchased a pair years ago and lost them while traveling, so I had to buy another pair. I own diamond earrings, gold earring, gemstones etc, but these are my favorite pair of earrings! They are light weight, fun and go with everything. I love taking them with me when I travel because I never need to take other earrings. I wear them almost everyday! Great value and would make a great gift. This was my first purchase on Swarovski jewelry and I am now totally hooked! <end>
 B000EWOMXK  Sterling Silver MultiColor Cubic Zirconia 1/2 inch Long and 12 mm in Diameter Barrell Pendant ||	  CZ Barrell Pendant  A pretty addition to a plain chain that makes it something special. The colors are pretty, but not overpowering. I recommend <end>
 B000EX0TOU  Jewelry Box With Drawers - Style 36674 ||	  Really great value  For the money this was a fantastic product. It was a small gift for my girlfriend for Christmas (the big gift was inside!), and she really likes it. It was built 10x nicer then anything else I looked at in the same price range. It throws me off every time I go to open it thought. The top drawer looks like it slides out, but it actually only flips up. Very nice, affordable, space effective jewelry box. <end>  Nice quality  I am very happy with the size and quality of this product, the price was a bonus. I didn't want or need large case, and this was perfect, with divisions that were useful to me. For such an inexpensive product it is well put together and finished. <end>
 B000EZ4ASO  Amazon.com  Sterling Silver 3D Irish Dance Clogging Charm 925  Clothing ||	  great value  This is an excellent value and a beautiful silver charm. My daughter has added it to her charm bracelet, but it could easily be a pendant for a necklace as well. It's a nice weighty piece of silver and great detail. Any Irish dancer or lover of Irish dance would enjoy receiving this. <end>  Sterling Silver Ghillie Irish shoe charm  I purchased this sterling silver charm for my daughter who is taking Irish dancing class and I know she'll love this now for a necklace and later on for a charm bracelet. It's a really cool charm, one any student of Irish dancing would love. <end>
 B000F05TLK  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Overlapping Polished Finish Band Ring Size 10 ||	  pretty but-  this is a nice looking ring and i do like the design. however i assumed it was connected or soldered together where the silver overlaps since there were different sizes. it is not connected and so the ring is unstable in my opinion and i am afraid that movement back and forth will sooner or later break the ring. sadly, i will be returning this one. <end>  Silver Ring  Great price for a nice product. Shipping was quick and the ring arrived in perfect condition. <end>
 B000F0XRCS  Sterling Silver Tube Hoop Earrings with Post-Snap Closure 2.5mm 1/2 inch round ||	  Great Hoops for the Price  Super little SS hoops for the price. In fact you cannot beat it. I wear mine about 3/4 of the time. However, the hing is a bit weak, so I have had to buy three pairs. But the cost and quality over than the hing is great. I just get the same size over and use the left over spare hoop with the new one with no problem. All SS hoops have their weaknesses regardless of price. The metal is just tough to make a good hing with. I will buy another set again when I need to!! <end>
 B000F0ZT7Y  Sterling Silver Egyptian Ankh Charm Bracelet , 1/4 inch (6 mm). ||	  Item as described; Received quickly; Great doing business with!  We ordered this item 12.18 and knew upfront that the estimated ship date was 12.22. To be on the safe side, we ordered expedited shipping. The item was received 12.24, just in time for Christmas.The bracelet looks beautiful and is professionally made. Each ankh is thicker than I expected at this price. The clasp is sturdy, which is quite important, given that the gift was for a 17-year-old who regularly loses jewelry.We would do business with this seller anytime. <end>

It arrived very promptly. I was delighted to see how delicate and dainty it was--just right for a small or average-sized wrist. <end>  great product, quick delivery  bracelet was an excellent gift. the drama masks were very intricate yet quite detailed. a great gift for any drama/theatre fans. <end>
 B000F11FXA  Sterling Silver Children's Bangle Bracelet Junior Size Hand Engraved Floral Pattern 3/16 inch wide ||	  Sterling Silver Baby Bangle  Beautiful bracelet, we got it for our little girl who is actually not a baby but 7 years old as she is small for her age, it's the perfect size for her. Anyway she loves it and wears it whenever she dresses up for family events and dinners out now and then. <end>
 B000F14816  Gent's Sterling Silver Large Oval Tiger Eye Ring ||	  Large Oval Ring  This ring is good quality at a decent price. beyond that they went out of their way to get it to me quickly when I needed it. <end>
 B000F15K6I  Sterling Silver domed Ring w/ Large Ridges Flawless Quality Finish 5/8 inch wide, sizes 6 to 10 ||	  Not what I bargained for...  This ring is very flat instead of the domed look it shows in the picture. I was very disappointed and returned the ring, waiting for my refund. <end>
 B000F1872M  Sterling Silver 7 mm Southwest Design Ring with a Row of Beads handmade inch wide ||	  Beautifull  I enjoy the look of this ring and I wear it all the time. <end>
 B000F187YU  Gent's Sterling Silver Large Square Tiger Eye Ring ||	  Looks great!  A very well made and good looking ring and like it says, it is large. <end>
 B000F19RBC  Sterling Silver 8 mm Southwest Design Pot Leaf Ring 5/16 inch wide Hand Made ||	  Great ring, just don't wear it when you fly!  I was wearing my nice, new marijuana leaf ring when I flew into Jacksonville recently...for 'some reason' my luggage was chosen to be searched. That costs me a 40 minute wait for my luggage to appear on the turnstile, a trip to the office to report my stuff 'lost' and a nice 4 hour delay when the security boys ripped into my bags like weasels tearing into a cupcake! The bag finally arrived at my Hotel room with a broken latch, minus my binoculars...[I wonder what they found--Or, if they just liked my binocs?]. So, lesson learned; wear this ring in appropriate venues only! <end>
 B000F1X2FY  Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1mm Omega Chain Necklace ||	  Not good for pendants  I wish I had given more credibility to the negative reviews. Frankly, I don't understand how there ecould be so many positive reviews. It's an ok chain - if you want to wear it by itself. But it's not good for pendants, as advertised. It remains perfectly stiff and oval shaped when worn - even a large pendant doesn't pull the chain down as a pendant normally does. I'm returning it. <end>  22" OMEGA  THIS OMEGA IS SO PRETTY. IT IS STURDY AND WILL HOLD ALL OF YOUR PENDANTS...I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY BUY ONE FROM THIS SELLER. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY SHINY AND I LOVE IT 5 STARS ALL THE WAY ) <end>  the kind of chain i like  i bought this omega chain sometime last month June 2009 and it just fit me right..i love it..the shipping was super fast that i didnt expect that it would come that day..i would really recommend this Seller to everyone..i would definitely wants to purchase again to this seller.. <end>  Silver Necklace...1MM Omega  The Italian Sterling Silver Omega Chain Necklace looked a bit dainty but it is not! It is strong and beautiful. Looks great with or without a pendant. I love it! Excellent for summer because it is not too heavy.Thanks for a great product. <end>  Great Necklace!  I love this necklace. I needed a chain thin enough to go through a slide pendant that I love. This necklace is perfect! Thin enough to slide through the slots and sturdy enough to hold it with no problems. I've worn it just about everyday since it arrived. Fast service, I was very pleased. I will buy many more times from this seller! <end>  Great Buy!  The is a beautiful necklace that looks great alone or with a slide. I purchased it for my 18 yr. old daughter and she loves it. Excellent quality for an excellent price. <end>  silver necklace from Gem  item is much nicer than the picture.My girls were so pleased, I had purchased some handwrought pendants on a vacation in Greece this summer and they looked lovely on the chains! <end>  A+ Product  I ordered this omega to go with a slide pendant. I was at my wits end trying to find a chain with a clasp small enough to fit through the opening, without dropping $50+. Not only did this omega fit and look perfect, but the shipping and was super-fast too. This necklace looks and feels much more expensive than it was. I will definately purchase from this seller again. <end>  quality necklace.  very nice omega chain for the price. i would definitely shop with this seller again. <end>  The perfect answer  I had ordered a pendant to wear to a family wedding and needed a chain. This Omega was the perfect answer. This item is well worth the money. <end>  Perfect !  This Omega necklace is the perfect size and gauge for fused glass pendants. I am ordering several more. Thanks! <end>  Omega Chain  I have bought a 14" omega chain which is good. Unfortunately, there is no alert that the 14" size chain is is intended for children. I know its not the sellers' fault but mine, however, seller should alert the buyer that the size 14" chain is not intended for adult.Its beautiful. <end>  chain  very pretty chain...great price and pretty good quality. i work with 20 kids, who are 3, and have worn the chain with a pendant on it for a couple months and its bent in one spot but i think it has been wonderful and i would buy it again <end>  Necklace  I got the necklace and it is everything I thought it would be. I really like it. <end>  I look good  I put the cross on it and good to go <end>  Not very good at all  This necklace is like a strong circle of silver. there was almostno bend to it at all and it was not fluid. <end>  False Advertising!!!  This is NOT a chain necklace. If you buy this product you will get an 18" long, 1.26 mm diameter tube with tiny notches along its surface. The "strong lobster clasp" looks like it's made of cheap plastic. <end>  Excellent Quality Omega  Omegas are stiff. That is their characteristic. They are pre-formed to remain round and keep their shape while wearing. These are not fluid chains. Generally, they are worn close to the neck and able to support the weight of heavier pendants and enhancers. These are strong chains. Omegas tend not to slide around the neckline. While wearing, it's unlikely the back closure will drift to the front of the neck. Pendants and enhancers tend to stay put. This can be thought of as a "silver collar".Often, Omegas are 3 or 4mm thick. I was happy to get this one in the 1mm. It fits the bale on most of my pendants. I have a 4mm that will only accommodate large bales.This is an excellent quality Italian omega, at a great price. The silver has a nice gleam, it's smooth, and has a lobster claw clasp. It's made very well. Thanks, Gem Avenue.If you want a freely moving chain, this seller has a large selection of really good quality silver chains...all at reasonable prices. If you want a very smooth, solid looking chain. I recommend a snake chain. It looks similar to an omega, but has fluidity. <end>  Beautiful chain  This chain is really gorgeous. I was very impressed when it arrived. It is really hard to find chains of this length, especially of this quality. I love it! <end>  Great chain for petite a neck.  I have been on a lifelong search for 14 & 15 inch chains. I have a petite neck, and need the smaller length. This chain is not only the right size, it is very pretty and substantial for the price. thanks you for making it available. <end>  14" Omega Silver Chain Necklace  I bought this necklace for my own use. I am a small adult. It is just what I have been looking for and doesn't look like something just for a child. The necklace is beautiful and perfect! I am enjoying wearing it with various pendants.Attractive Sterling Silver 1 MM Italian Box Link Chain 14" 16" 18" 20" 22" 24" 30" Necklace <end>  Just what I hoped for!  I ordered two of these 1 MM Omega chains to go with gift pendants and, they were everything I was hoping for. Strong, shiney, secure lobster clasp, and able to give some extra "lift" to show off the pendant. I ordered thin Omegas such as these so that I could slide the pendants on easily. I am using one of them myself with a large, simple gemstone that I wish to showcase. Advice  Try this company! Nice customer service, great product and price, small gift boxes that you can wrap before giving, and good delivery. <end>  nice gift for a young girl  I ordered this necklace for a young girl to hold a little turtle pendant I purchased for her. The pendant has some weight and does come with its own chain, but I thought the omega would give this young girl a different, but still delicate look. She will be able to use this chain with any pendant she may have or receive in the future. It's a sweet necklace that, once she grows out of it, can be passed on to one of her younger sisters. I was pleased with my purchase. <end>  Very nice necklace - love it!  This necklace is very nice. Its like a choker necklace but at a better price. Looks to be of good quality it will work well as a casual necklace if your looking for something more then you will have to pay more. As the saying goes you get what you pay for. Really its a very nice necklace. <end>  AWESOME  I needed a chain for my cross it works well and good price came in a jewel box I love it thanksa little tight for my neck but I like it that way I don't want to be mistakin for a rapper <end>
 B000F2FQG6  14k Yellow and Rose Gold "Grandma" Heart Pendant ||	  For my Gammy  I'm not into jewelry and don't know much about it. I bought it as a gift for my Grammy and she seems to love it. Nice and lovely pendant I think. <end>  beautiful gift for grandma  This pendant is beautiful. I got one for my mother and one for my mother-in-law. They are going to love them. I highly recomend this as a gift. It looks like ones that I have seen at the mall. <end>  Grandma Heart Pendant  This was agreat value and an outstanding product. My wife has enjoyed from the minute I gave it to her. <end>  everything as promised  The charm arrived on time in perfect condition. I have received many compliments on it and asked where I bought it. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. <end>  Gold Grandma Charm  Very nice as a mothers day present or birthday present. I would recommend you pair it with a nice charm bracelet. <end>
 B000F2HSS0  14k Yellow Gold Sea Star Pendant ||	  Made a difference for this one!  This is a very well done little starfish! I bought it after our school district gave each employee a small starfish with the little story about making a difference for each one the person rescued from the low tide. I've gotten several compliments when I've worn it. <end>  Cute  This is very cute and nice in person. It doesn't look cheap at all. <end>  Good investment  With the price of gold increasing, this is a good investment. Great item for a necklace. Beautiful gold. Beautiful sea star. <end>  Nice charm!  This is a great charm for a gold chain! The charm looks just as pictured and the quality is good, so I'm very pleased with my purchase. <end>  Very cute pendant.  Shiny substantial piece. Nice size, not a tiny charm like those for charm bracelets. Just as pictured. <end>  sea star pendant  It is lovely and well crafted, a very good product for the money. The shipping was fast too! <end>  glitter  Cheap chain but this is a grat product for the money. My mother loves it and 14c makes a difference in brillance. Hand carved dosen't hurt either. <end>  Spectacular piece  I am using this for a necklace. It has a really nice shine, almost as if there were chips around the perimeter. Attractive but, not gaudy. A nice size and good weight. Thanks! <end>
 B000F2J9NM  Loving Family&reg Small Sterling Silver Pendant Necklace with Extender - Parents and 2 Children ||	  It ain't Tiffany but it's not supposed to be!  We just had twins and my wife wanted something that was cute. As you could imagine being a new family with twins we are no longer rich! LOL! This is actually a nice piece of jewelry. Of course keep in mind this is not a product from Tiffany's but for what it is, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget. The piece shows nice and appears to have some "staying" power. <end>  Bonus points from Mom for this purchase!!! Very Nice and Simple!  Wife loved this pendent for Christmas, was a great success. Very nice and simple reminder why we are here... (Family) <end>  Great Gift  My wife loved this when I gave it to her for Christmas. The chain is not cheap and has held up with the use this gets. Good detail in the pendant and my wife has had many people comment on it. <end>
 B000F3FX7C  Children's Platinum Hoop Earrings ||	  Perfect for earring charms.  I have become sensitive to all metals except Platinum. Replacing my earring collection with Platinum does not fit into my budget. My solution is to buy Platinum hoops and convert my favorite earrings to earring charms. Sense the charms do not come in contact with my skin, the charms can be of almost any metal. These 10mm Platinum hoop earrings hug my ears perfectly. The delicate size does not distract attention from my charms. I am also buying the 17.5mm Platinum hoop earrings for those times I want to put on more than one charm at a time. <end>  Perfect size for second piercing  I'm sensitive to many metals including low grade surgical steel...which was put in for my second piercing. They bothered me for over 2 years. Then I finally found this part of earrings. They feel great and look great. Love the small size. Wish they were cheaper. <end>  review  they are very small and cute,I was really excited about these,I know that I can only wear surgical stainless earrings, but I thought that I would like to test platinum, as it turns out, they make my ears itch.they are a little hard to get on and off, plan on having a friend help you as these are very solid earrings. <end>
 B000F3O8WS  14k Yellow Gold Enamel Ladybug Earrings ||	  THESE MAY NOT FLY AWAY HOME  With the nice screw backs, these beauties may actually remain in my daughter's ears. A number of her earrings (non-bug) have had a tendencyto "fly away," never to be found again...usually due to the "slide" backs,I think. A father, I don't know exactly how to describe this stuff, bearwith me. I was hesitant, but the price & prior experiences with Amazongave me the courage to buy these. Now I wish I'd bought four pair, esp.since I see the price is, um, a bit higher than my pair. Oh, well...Icould not be happier with my purchase! Come in a nice bag, box &, allin all, a quite purty gift. M. Swofford <end>  Love them......  When I ordered these, I was a little nervous. However, once I recieved them I was rather impressed! These are perfect for small ears and I love how the backs of the earrings are screw-ons and they do not dig into the ear or behind the ear (which is a problem I run into with my daughter who is 5). She loves these earrings! The picture on Amazon is horrible, these are quite pretty and nice. I would definately order more! <end>  Way too Small  They were cute earrings. Came earlier then expected. I was buying them as a gift for my Two-year-old Niece. When I received the earrings they were way too small. The seller should put the actual size of the earrings in the description!! The image of the earrings will fool you. The earrings are a perfect size for an infant and for a baby the age of one. DO NOT get for a 2 yr old or older you will be very disappointed. <end>  CUTE LITTLE EARRINGS  The picture is really bad of these. They are very sweet and bright.The only concern I have is they don't screw very tightly in the back. I might use a different back. <end>  Ladybug  Perfect!! My daughter has worn these earrings for the past month & has not lost one yet. Fast shipping, excellent condition. Cutier in person. <end>  Very Cute for your little Ladybug  The earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find. My daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one. But that is no bash on the earrings, the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment.I would definitely buy them again. <end>
 B000F3O90O  14k White Gold Beaded Mesh Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  Better than I ever expected...  I bought this for my 14 year old daughter as her 8th grade graduation present. I figured that if it looked anything like the picture, we'd be in business. I'm pleased to tell you that it looks FAR BETTER than what you see in the picture! Please note that it is NOT a flat bracelet... The mesh/beading forms a complete circle making this much more beautiful and much more substantial that it would have been if it was flat. When my wife saw it she just about fell out of her chair - I know that she would love to have this bracelet for herself (I think that it would diminish my daughter's gift though and it would be a little tacky on my part, so I'm trying to refrain from buying her one - it's so hard not to - must refrain - must be strong). Finally, take a look at how much this thing weights - nearly 1/4 of an ounce. As of this writing, gold is at $653.50 per ounce (of course, that's for 99.9% pure gold - but still) - you do the math... It's a steal! <end>
 B000F3Q2ZO  14k Yellow Gold Filigree Dangle Earrings ||	  Sparkly, lightweight , and delicate earrings!  These earrings dangle about an inch below the earlobe and sparkle prettily as you move. They are so lightweight that you don't feel them at all. I purchased them on a Friday sale for $49 and am very pleased with the quality and value. Handle these earrings very gently, though, as they are quite delicate. <end>  My experience  I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago. The reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring. I tried to wear them, but the half arrow was too big, and I couldn't get them through my earlopes. <end>  I returned them  For jewelry I purchase from Amazon these were on the higher end of a medium price, if that makes any sense. So I expected more. They really did remind me of tin foil. I did like the hooks they use but the earrings are very fragile and dull. I returned them. <end>  Elegant  The gold dangle earrings purchased were flawless and very beautiful. I was extremely impressed when I opened the box with the quality and workmanship. They really delivered the understated sparkle and gold detail I was looking for. Don't hesitate because these are perfect! <end>  I love these earrings  I am so happy to have purchased these earrings. They are beautiful and very stylish. They are delicate and should be kept protected. <end>  Perfect pair of earrings  I get more compliments on this simpe little pair of earrings. Everyone should have a pair! These fit great and feel wonderful on. <end>
 B000F3S7QQ  14k White Gold Round St. Michael Medal ||	  pleased  It was smaller than I thought it would be but I am very pleased with the quality of the charm. I had it blessed & I intend on wearing it every day of my life. <end>  Great Craftsmanship  I agree with the other reviewer that this medal is small, but it's perfect for me. I wear it on a short necklace, and would recommend it for someone looking for a dainty piece of jewelry with a strong presence. <end>  Perfect  Pendant is beautiful! Perfect weight for a pendant. The detailed design is very intricate with a high polish shine. Delivered within in a dark blue velvet pouch and blue gift box. Classy and not cheap looking! <end>  Small in size Big on quality!  The Archangel Michael white gold medal is small in size, but the Big on quality. I would recommend this piece if you're looking for something to wear everyday and anyday. <end>
 B000F3V9X4  14k Yellow Gold Round Baptismal Medal ||	  Nice medallion, edge should be smoother  would have given a 5 if the edge is smoother. I bought 2 of these and both have same issue. Will probably not be so comfy & safe to be worn by babies because of the edge; appears to be a little sharp to me <end>
 B000F3V9Y8  14k Yellow Gold Little Boy Charm ||	  Nice  It is just what you see in the picture. It is thin but not so thin it will bend. Got a good deal on it and the little girl to match. Both are 3/4 of an inch high with the height of the ring on top and they are 1 inch high. Because they overlap you'll need spacer beads or something else between charms if you want more then one on the same chain (one for each of your kids for instance.) I went to Hobby Lobby and picked up some glass beads to space them out. Worked out well.Good choice if you want to honor your kids but don't want to spend $300 or more on the Kidz charms. <end>
 B000F41BZY  2mm Sterling Silver Ball Stud Earrings ||	  Love this company!!  I love their products and will defninitly order from them again! They ship quickly and deliver as promised. <end>  Nice earrings, but what's with the color?  So, I got this item and I loved it. They felt nice in my ears and didn't hurt at all.Well, that all changed a few weeks later. I had wore these earrings for pretty much 24/7. I took them out to let my ears breathe to find out that one of the earrings had turned a gray color with bronze coloring underneath it/mixed in. I also noticed that the back wire part of the earring looked like it was about to snap off. I really like the look of these earrings, but a total of $10 is a little pricey for a single pair of earrings that seem to wear pretty easily and are questionable quality.I then sent a message asking about the earring quality and the problem I was having, and all they said was that it was sterling silver and that I could return the RING for a refund. Firstly, I didn't order a ring, I ordered a pair of EARRINGS. Secondly, they seemed rather rude in the message. You think a company would apologize, and explain why the item turned out this way and maybe even offer to send a replacement. I'm just a bit baffled. No I don't plan on making a refund, seeing how i'd have to PAY to mail them back. I'll just keep the pair and take my business else where. <end>  disappointing in the long run  I'm wondering if the company Sabrina Silver shipped different products to different people, because my experience was right in line with the reviewers who said the earrings started out fine but then discolored and caused (mild) infection at the piercing site. At times I've had sterling silver earrings tarnish and was able to re-polish them with conventional silver polish, but these appear to have worn down to base metal, so it looks as if they were silver plated and not sterling silver at all. I have multiple ear piercings and typically successfully leave earrings in the upper holes without taking them out for cleaning very often, but it took about 3 or 4 weeks for these completely to deteriorate, and my ears are not particularly sensitive; IOW, I often do fine with dollar earrings!Yes, the style was exactly what I wanted but for something that didn't last and did not remain comfortable or wearable the price was far too high. However, I've bought other jewelry from Sabrina Silver that has been wonderful, which is the reason I'm asking if products got switched off in some cases. <end>  Cheap Metals, NOT Sterling Silver  I received this product as a gift and within days the "silver" coating wore off exposing cheap metals, which ended up infecting my ear. Originally these were intended to be used as a nose stud (as the description claims they can be used as) which is not true at all. Nose studs DO NOT have an earring back. Trying to wear this as a nose stud is painful and unsanitary. This product is NOT made of sterling silver. Avoid this product if cheap metals irritate your skin! <end>  Silver Plated Not Silver  I loved these when I got them. I have 5 piercings in each ear and loved that I had options to get different sized balls so i could stack them up my ear. They worked well for 2 weeks and then my ears started bothering me. I wore these 24/7. Other people have mention the discoloring on the post. Mine were not only discolored but the metal was corroding. I ended up with an infection in most of my ten piercings. Do not buy this product if you need silver earrings. I bought these because they stated they were .925 silver. They are obviously plated and are not what was advertized. <end>  Super cute!  These earrings were exactly what I was looking for! Tiny, but not microscopic. Looks great in the cartilidge  ) Not so small it will go through the hole. <end>  Great if you have multiple piercings  I have two piercings per ear and love to wears these basic ball studs in my upper holes. They are sterling silver and I experienced no itching, green holes or discomfort. Shipping time was quick and I was happy with the price. <end>  Pefect.  I ordered these on Thursday and received them on Monday. Not only was the service great, but the earrings were exactly what I had been looking for but could not find. Perfect for my multiple ear piercings! <end>  Perfect Size Silver Ball Stud Earings For My Second And Third Hole In Ear  Purchased The Earings On A Monday, Received My Earings On A Thursday Of The Same Week!! They Are Just What I Have Been Looking For!! Thank You. <end>  Cute Nose Studs  These tiny studs are great for multiple ear piercings as well as the perfect tiny nose stud also- I've purchased this pair of studs as a set w/ the 1mm super tiny studs and I love them both as nose studs- They're perfectly small if you're looking for the hardly noticable look in the way of nose jewelry or multiple ear piercing jewelry =)Happy w/ my purchases from this seller!2 thumbs up!Thanks! 5 Stars for you! <end>  Great little earings  Perfect size for multiple earings in each ear! Also, I'm sensitive to a lot of earings and these don't bother my ears at all. Thanks. <end>
 B000F4DMKQ  10 KT Yellow Gold Celtic Slim Band 10K Ring Size 7.5 ||	  Very nice for the price  I bought this ring as something to wear in place of my wedding ring to save it from some wear and tear.. and I love it. The knot work is lovely and the gold finish very pretty. Size was exactly right too. <end>  Celtic Ring  Beautiful ring and at a very good price. It is a thin band though and is very easily bent. <end>
 B000F4NM3I  Amazon.com  Rhinestone Bracelet Elastic  Clothing ||	  Rhinestone Bracelet  When the bracelet arrived, rhinestones had already fallen out of the bracelet and were in the unopened package! When we took it out of the package, even more rhinestones fell off the bracelet. We were unable to even put the rhinestones back on the bracelet. Very, very cheap looking. Will not use and it is not worth sending back because of having to pay the postage to receive it and pay the postage to return it. <end>  LITTLE KIDS JEWELRY  When I opened the package this was packed in a dollar store little kids princess package!This is dime store garbage!!WHAT a RIPOFF!! <end>  Amazon Rhinestone Bracelet  What a piece of crap. The majority of rhinestones fell off the first time my wife wore the bracelet. Would not recommend it. It is cheap. <end>
 B000F4UNAS  I Heart my 5th Wheel Laser Etched Italian Charm ||	  Cute!  I love this cute little charm, and bought a few different designs from the same seller, Clearly Charming -) <end>  Mother loved it!  My mother loved this gift, as she has a fifth wheel that they travel in now! <end>
 B000F57WZ6  Natural Ruby in Zoisite Pear Shape Gemstones Sterling Silver Bracelet Adjustable 7" to 8" ||	  sweet bracelet  pretty, delicate, feminine bracelet. smaller in reality than it seemed in the picture but very nicely made. my mom liked it so much, i got her one for christmas. <end>  Too green for me.  I have Zoisite earrings and a pendant that have a good mix of the pink with the green. This one had very dark green stones in it so I did return it. Just not my style. <end>  a gift  This bracelet was a gift for one of my family, so I didn't see it, because I live in France, and my family In California, but it was appreciated and I was thanked for it. So I think it's a good product and very easy to buy mostly when we are far from our family!Yvette Parmentier <end>
 B000F5CXV4  Genuine Freshwater Pearl Beaded Sterling Silver Bracelet or Anklet - 7.5" to 10.5" ||	  Beyond Beautiful  This anklet is great I received a lot of complements.

I am going to order it for the 3rd time. Worth it. <end>
 B000F5IAHU  Sterling Silver Italian Curb Cuban Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 10.7mm Heavy weight Beveled Edges Nickel Free, sizes 8 - 30 inch ||	  VERY NICE!  I was hesitant on buying an expensive piece like this online, before actually seeing it. Nothing to be worried about here! Very nice and very well priced .925 Italian made sterling silver chain! If you have an issue with finding jewelry like this that is authentic at local stores around your area, I highly recommend buying from Sabrina Silver.Only downside to this product is the box it came in. They say It's a box that looks nice enough to use as a gift box. But all it is is a little metallic cardboard box. So if this is a gift for someone, I would consider buying a necklace gift box along with your purchase.Other than that, the shipping was very fast! Arrived before expected delivery date.GREAT BUY!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!Sterling Silver 7/16 in. (10.7 mm) Extra Large Curb Link Chain Necklace, NICKEL FREE, 30 in. <end>
 B000F5XMC8  Bioplast Black Red Marracas Belly Ring ||	  super cute  my first plastic ring and love it. post is bendable. the ball that hangs down is a really sexy size. really cute. my husband loves it. <end>
 B000F5XRG4  Bioplast Black Marble Circular Horse Shoe ||	  bioplast horseshoe review  I really like them. They are light weight and I don't have to worry about triggering the metal detector when wearing them. They are durable. <end>
 B000F60XLK  Bioplast Purple Glitter Belly Ring ||	  great, but color a bit off  i recieved this ring in the mail yesterday, it is a great product, but the color is a bit more pink than it appears on the computer. otherwise no complaints <end>
 B000F60XSI  Bioplast Electric Blue Belly Ring ||	  Pretty!  I'm a fan of bioplast since the first time I wore one of these! They feel great, and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape, convenience (no pain, no sticking to clothes, no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning), and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! Love love love them! <end>
 B000F612I8  Bioplast Light Blue Floral Swirl Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Pretty good  The ring is really comfortable, buttt plac build up is awful even if you brush your teeth like 3 times a day. The ring also bent after a week or so of wearing it <end>  Awesome company and awesome product!!  I love this tongue ring. It's super cute and super comfortable. It's nice and lightweight and definitely flexible, but not to the point where it's crap. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the balls are tough to screw on, especially in your mouth. But I probably just have to break it in like all tongue barbells. Great company too. If you're interested in this, I would order it from their website bodycandy.com (while you're there you can check out all their other cool stuff!!). It's cheaper this way because if you just search in Google for coupon codes you'll find a few like free shipping or 15% off. They have great customer service too and fast shipping. <end>
 B000F612J2  Bioplast Blue Green Beach Ball Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  Really Is Bioplast  A lot of tongue rings claim to be bendy bioplast and this one def. is. Very comfortable bar so I use it interchangeably with other jewelry, the beach ball design looks pretty unique too and I love the colors. <end>
 B000F612V0  Bioplast Disco Ball Circular Horse Shoe ||	  looks great, but is quite short  I ordered this product to wear as a replacement for my old highly damaging metal labret horseshoe. When I opened the envelope I noticed that this body ring is much shorter than i am use to seeing for sale. Even with one bead exchanged out for a smaller ball this ring doesn't clear the top of my lower lip. I am not mad though. the bioplast already feels much nicer against my teeth and gums. the best part is that the ring is flexible and doesn't create much pressure on my lip. I am giving this a rating of 3 stars, the lost stars are for the shortness. <end>
 B000F62RZK  Bioplast Red Blooming Star Belly Ring ||	  Okay  Great detail on the design, looks just like the picture but when the ring is in, you cannot see the design on the bottom ball because it is angled down. Instead, you see the design on the top ball and red ovals on the bottom. <end>
 B000F62S9K  Bioplast Blue Belly Ring ||	  Love Love Love  I've recently gotten my bellybutton piercing. I'd highly recommend. It looks just like the picture and has an amazing glow. Looks awesome at parties  ) <end>
 B000F62XOA  Bioplast Black Red Hearts Circular Horse Shoe ||	  cheap, fancy balls!  I bought this product so I could wear the beads on my industrial. Unfortunately, I screwed one on too tight, and it split in half. While that was sad, I was very impressed with how fast this item shipped. If you do purchase this, remember to take care when putting the jewelry on- you don't want to split your balls! <end>
 B000F62XOU  Bioplast Blue Green Beach Ball Circular Horse Shoe ||	  Meh  The colors aren't as bold as in the picture, and it's actually more yellow and blue than green and blue. <end>
 B000F64NDO  Bioplast Pink Purple Hearts Belly Ring ||	  so cute!  I wear it like every day and I am not allergic to it! Cause it's not cheap metal! <end>
 B000F64NK2  Bioplast Blue Swirly Beach Ball Belly Ring ||	  Great for people who react to metal  This belly button ring is great for people who have allergic reactions to metal. It has been wonderful for me. <end>
 B000F64NNO  Bioplast Keywest Jawbreaker Belly Ring ||	   ))  I LOVE bioplast!! it is soo comfortabel! and plus i love the coloring of this belly ring =] <end>
 B000F64SP2  Bioplast Raspberry Rainbow Stripe Barbell Tongue Ring ||	  A suitable item that exceeded my expectations  I was devastated when I had lost my 14kt gold tongue ring a few weeks back; I made a pact with myself to not spend so much on something so easily lost next time around. That's when I decided to try this Bioplast raspberry rainbow tongue ring. I am amazed! highly fashionable, and Like it's not there at all. Though if I could do it again I would have probably chosen a more natural color. This is highly noticeable when you don't want it to be (meetings, etc.) with your mouth as closed as possible <end>
 B000F6BSVE  Southwestern Style Chevron Band Ring with Turquoise Chip Inlay and Sterling Silver for Men or Women, Size 11, #1775 ||	  Soooo Happy!!!  These rings are beautiful. Excellent quality.

 B000F6DOM0  Sterling Silver, Turquoise and Coral Chip Inlay Ring for Men or Women Size 6, #1773 ||	  Sentimental Value  I love this ring. I didn't buy this ring on Amazon. I don't know where this ring originally came from or how long it's been around but I have one. It was my Grandpa's and I got it 15 years ago when he died. It is a lovely ring. Silver and Turquoise have always been my favorite colors too. And the coral goes really well with the turquoise. <end>
 B000F6SWJ0  Eeyore Disney Winnie The Pooh Italian Charm ||	  Charming Eeyore  The Eeyore Italian Charm Link was TREMENDOUS. Looks like the real Eeyore on Disney merchandise. Quality was outstanding. Would buy this seller's merchandise in a heartbeat. <end>

 B000F791DU  Sterling Silver And Blue Topaz Flower Earrings By Zina ||	  Very large  I had expected these to be small stud earrings. They are about 1/2 inch in size and cover almost my entire earlobe. My teenagers told me they look like "old lady" earrings. <end>  jhp3946@yahoo.com  Received for Christmas. They are beautiful.Delay in the delivery time by USPS but they are so pretty who cares if they did not arrive on time.Great after holiday surprise. <end>

 B000F7B1TM  Sterling Silver Moon and Lady Belly Button Ring - Customize Your Fit, by picking from 3 Barbell Lengths ||	  SEXY!  Love this piece! I have had this piece for 2 years now and have had only minor problems. Yes, the moon does catch on the jeans once in a while, but nothing too bothersome. I will order another one as the one I have is just now starting to loosen up. I have had it drop off once, only because I didn't check it for tightness. Because I have cynched it up too much,the threads are too loose. It wants to tighten too much. My fault. All in all, I may order 2 just to have for a looooooong time!  ) <end>  Sexy  Stunning piece of jewelry, there's a lot of detail for such a small piece. The only issue is that it tends to pinch a bit when the charm moves around, and will grab hold of jeans when you stand up after sitting for a while. Still worth it, though, because it looks so great and is really high quality. <end>  moon ring  gorgeous belly ring, had it for 2 monthsthen blue stone fell out of the top part. <end>
 B000F7B3HC  Sterling Silver Hana Design Bracelet by Zina ||	  This is rhodium plated  I did not know this bracelet is rhodium plated (apparently many silver pieces are). I found this out when I took the bracelet to a jeweler to have a link removed so it would fit my thin wrist. My concern is that over time the bracelet is bound to get scratched and when it does the plating and the exposed silver will tarnish differently - making for an uneven finish. This piece is not worth the full price but I think I will be happy at the sale price when I get it back from the jeweler. FYI - I think that most Zina pieces are rhodium plated - something they leave out of the decription. It is a beautiful piece and I look forward to wearing it with the necklace and earrings from the same collection. <end>  Stunning  I had this bracelet on my wish list for a long time. When it went on sale recently, I made the leap and bought it. And, I have to say, it is absolutely beautiful. It was still pretty pricey even on sale, but worth it. I love Zina jewelry, and this is probably my favorite Zina piece. Highly recommended. <end>
 B000F7OPBS  Tree of Life Necklace from the Artazia Collection #583 JN MN ||	  My wife loved this necklace!  It's a beautiful, organic design that brings to life the Etz Chaim, the Tree of Life, in the Chai symbol. Don't dip it in jewelry cleaner, though, as the blue paint is liable to fade. <end>  Beautiful  This necklace is just beautiful. I bought it for my daughter's best friend's Bat Mitzvah and all of the girls just loved it. <end>  Nicer than I expected.  Although the photographs looked good, I ordered with a little bit of doubt about how this would actually look. I've got to say, it is gorgeous. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she gets tons of compliments on this necklace and also on the butterfly earrings I ordered. Really nice stuff! <end>  Tree of Life  Really beautiful...even more so in person! Never been disappointed with this line of jewelry! The colors are vibrant and eye catching! <end>  Tree of life  Item as described....beautiful piece - colours not as vibrant as they look in the pic but still beautiful. Arrived on time and in good condition. Thanks! <end>  Incredibly beautiful necklace!  All I can say is...WOW! This is a beautiful piece of art... delicate, unique, colorful and very eye-catching. I have had so many compliments on my new Tree of Life necklace! The instructions that came with it said to handle it carefully and avoid moisture, etc. but I'm one of those who rarely takes off jewelry, haven't taken it off since I received it in July (now it's almost Oct)and it's holding up to my abuse fabulously! I plan on buying more of these for relatives for holidays. <end>  It's Here!  This is an incredible work of art, not to mention a spectacular jewlery piece. I remain enchanted with it and would like to collect more items from this artisan. I am so pleased.The artistry of Artazia is unmatched. <end>
 B000F7SPD2  Purple Hamsa Necklace to Protect from the Evil Eye from the Artazia Collection #2412P JN MN ||	  Awesome Unique Jewelry, Ignore The 1st Commenter...  I'm posting this review because the only one here is from someone who said it looked like a "child's charm" and returned it - That's absurd.I purchased the Blue version (not this purple) and it was very unique, eye-catching, and got lots of compliments, I highly recommend it.It comes on a very basic, thin chain... You're not paying for the chain, you're paying for the hand-crafted pendant, take it off and put it on your own nice chain (that's what I did). <end>  Not what I expected  I returned this after I received it. To me it looked very cheap and not worth the cost. Looked like a child's charm, but it was hand crafted. The return was very easy and they handled it very well. It was a good company to deal with, unfortunately I was not satisfied with the item. <end>
 B000F8FL3S  Gold Label 2 1/2-Inch Mini Mini Illuminated Music Boxes -- Skaters ||	  Mini music box  Loved the music box, and it was in fine condition - but the shipping wasn't good. It took a long while, and the box the music box came in was smashed and unusable. It was shipped in a puffy envelope, not a shipping box- horribly poor shipping in my opinion. But the item itself- discounting the shipping- was fine.They need to ship in the future in a box with good packing materials, not mail it in an envelope! <end>  Mr. Christmas brand not "Gold Label"  This is a cheaply made item that doesn't work well. The box doesn't close properly as the wood is unevenly cut and placed together. Also, the figures, etc... inside are pretty poorly done. For the cheap price, you can't go wrong but I'd rather spend more and get something better quality. <end>  Better than I thought  I bought this music box for my 4 yr old daughter. She loves it !! It is perfect for her little hands to hold with out dropping. She loves that it lights up when she opens the lid. I am very happy with what I got for the price and I will more then likely buy more from the collection. <end>  adorable and has good sound  This was a gift for my two year old daughter - I know she is too young to play with it by herself, but she is quite good about not destroying things and we just tell her "one finger touch" and she is very gentle with such items. This box has a great sound to it, like a music box should, (as long as you are not expecting the true mechanical quality of a $200 German music box). The lit tree and rotating ring of skaters make it a great keepsake that we will pull out every Christmas and enjoy. <end>  delightful music box  I love this little music box. It looks like a classic expensive box from another era. I bought it to use with dolls and it is just perfect.donna <end>  Christmas Spirit  Darling gift for grandchildren, stocking stuffers, Secret Santas. Of six grandchildren, allparticularly mentioned this one! <end>  Gold Miniature Music Box - Skaters  I liked this the least of the series. Generally, I think these little music boxes and most charming and whimsical. <end>  Sadly disappointed  This product was so cheap looking! It wasn't worth a dime. I am very disappointed! <end>
 B000F93378  Moonstone necklace, 'Dazzle' 15.8" L ||	  Pendant is NOT made from silver and looks cheap  Unfortunately, just the chain, but not the pendant wears a 925-stamp. The metal of the pendant also looks very cheap. Especially on the back side you can see that it is definitely no real silver. Furthermore, the stone does not look like moonstone and is scratched too. If I would not have gotten it to Germany on a difficult way, I definitely would return it. Wasted money. Just trash. Horrible quality. I would never order anything again from this seller ... <end>
 B000F93440  Caduceus, 14K Gold Diamond Charm ||	  Extremely Happy  This item surpassed even my greatest expectations. It was the perfect size for my petite medical student who graduated in May of 2009 and she was delighted with it. <end>
 B000F934JU  Southwestern Style Bear and Bear Paw Design Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, Size 13, #11115 ||	  It is a pretty ring and worth more than it sold for.  This ring arrived really quickly. It is a beautiful ring and could have easily sold for more. My husband really liked it. It was a little loose but not too bad. For the money, a high quality ring. <end>  Great value. Out standing customer service.  This ring is beautiful and well made, it is worth the price and more. I bought two rings from Taos Trading Rings and they are both really well made at a very fair price. What is better is the customer service was outstanding. In the 10 years I have used Amazon I can remember writing one other review. But my experience was so good with this company that I really wanted to spread the word and encourage you to buy from them! I am leaving this same review for the other ring I bought too. <end>  Bear Ring  this ring is beautiful and just what I was looking for. My son's highschool mascot is a bear and this ring is perfect for him. <end>
 B000F934KO  Southwestern Native American Style Running Wolf Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, #11108 ||	  The Wolves /ring  The rings were even nicer than appeared in the site. The tourquiose is well set and the wolves have a good "shape" to them. Was very pleased with my purchase. These are to be used as wedding bands and make very nice ones. <end>  running wolf sterling silver ring with turquoise wolves  This ring was nice quality for the money. The running wolves little smaller than I had pictured them. The ring itself is nicely cut and polished. The running wolves are accented in turquoise and detailed nicely. This ring looks sturdy enough to be worn everyday with casual attire. Ring runs small tho should have ordered a larger size fits rather tightly on my finger. Would make a nice gift for anyone who loves wolves or native american style of jewelry. Very versatile for any woman or man who wants a unique looking ring. <end>  An Eye Catcher  This ring is very special. I bought it for my husband and many people have noticed and commented on its beauty. It is such a lovely and shiny silver and the turquoise wolves make a beautiful contrast. This is a unique ring and it is interesting because of the Native American component,being that it is a story-telling ring. <end>  Great Crafstmanship  This is a great ring....and the service and delivery are first rate. I would definitely recommend this ring and Taos Trading Company to those who are looking for quality products. The staff there are great and very helpful. I will be a repeat customer. <end>  Excellent and considerate service  I got a quick response when I inquired about when a size 7 would again be available. The sales person even E-mailed me when it came in and offered to hold one for me. I also love the ring! <end>  ring  I bought this ring for my husband and it was too small for his finger so now I have one and my husband has one. he does like it a lot. <end>  wonderful ring  As an avid wolf lover this ring is perfect for me. Has a beautiful turquios inlay that is well done and as a whole has a low profile. The ring is about 1/8" thick and pretty durable. <end>  Ring  This ring is so awesome! I highly recommend this. I love wolves and it's just so beautiful. The ring sizes are not what you normally wear. This one I got bigger because I thought it would be smaller like another one I ordered but they both ended up being the opposite so just be careful when ordering the size. Luckily both fit on a finger or I would have been in trouble  -/ <end>  Lovely ring  I bought this ring for a personal significance. It's beautiful, shiny, and the little turquoise wolves are cute, nicely shaped, and pretty as well.Someone in an earlier review said that the rings run a little small. Well I didn't have that problem. I got my ring and it fits perfectly!The only downside of this ring is that I've found it turns my finger green - which means the metal contains copper. Not a big deal, but I like when my rings don't turn my fingers weird colors.Overall  5 of 5 stars for a beautiful piece of jewelry that is a work of art!Follow up  12.25.10  The ring stopped turning my finger green once I wore it for a while. So it doesn't not do that anymore. <end>  Rather disappointed  I used part of a gift card to purchase this ring. The card was a gift for my 75th birthday. It is an attractive ring, but not worth the price. It looks as if it could be purchased at a flea market for 10.00 tops. The advertising picture was better than the item. (First time this has ever happened, right???) Just sorry I used my gift money, but unfortunately, "you learn by doing.". <end>
 B000F95948  Rose, 14K Gold Diamond Charm ||	  Rose Charm  For Christmas I wanted to give my sister a Rose Charm in memory of our Father who passed away two years earlier. I searched the jewerly stores at the local malls with now luck, either too cheap looking or no real depth. So decided to do a quick search on Google and found this charm on Amazon. I took a chance and ordered it.The charm arrived before xmas which was great since I ordered it on the 18th of December and it was beautiful, it had real weight and great detail particularly around the bud. I also liked that it had a lobster claw clasps, she could put it on right away.Very satisfied with the service and the qualityMy sister loved it <end>

I also love the ring! <end>  ring  I bought this ring for my husband and it was too small for his finger so now I have one and my husband has one. he does like it a lot. <end>  wonderful ring  As an avid wolf lover this ring is perfect for me. Has a beautiful turquios inlay that is well done and as a whole has a low profile. The ring is about 1/8" thick and pretty durable. <end>  Ring  This ring is so awesome! I highly recommend this. I love wolves and it's just so beautiful. The ring sizes are not what you normally wear. This one I got bigger because I thought it would be smaller like another one I ordered but they both ended up being the opposite so just be careful when ordering the size. Luckily both fit on a finger or I would have been in trouble  -/ <end>  Lovely ring  I bought this ring for a personal significance. It's beautiful, shiny, and the little turquoise wolves are cute, nicely shaped, and pretty as well.Someone in an earlier review said that the rings run a little small. Well I didn't have that problem. I got my ring and it fits perfectly!The only downside of this ring is that I've found it turns my finger green - which means the metal contains copper. Not a big deal, but I like when my rings don't turn my fingers weird colors.Overall  5 of 5 stars for a beautiful piece of jewelry that is a work of art!Follow up  12.25.10  The ring stopped turning my finger green once I wore it for a while. So it doesn't not do that anymore. <end>  Rather disappointed  I used part of a gift card to purchase this ring. The card was a gift for my 75th birthday. It is an attractive ring, but not worth the price. It looks as if it could be purchased at a flea market for 10.00 tops. The advertising picture was better than the item. (First time this has ever happened, right???) Just sorry I used my gift money, but unfortunately, "you learn by doing.". <end>
 B000F9NHU6  Dolphins on Green Malachite Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  LIKE ANIMALS; THESE ARE GREAT/BEAUTY AND STYLE  THESE EARRINGS GIVE YOU LOTS OF OPTIONS--CASUAL OR DRESSED UP; THEY ARE IN VOGUE BECAUSE OF THE ANIMAL, WHICH OF COURSE I PERSONALLY LOVE. MOST OF THE WOMEN--FRIENDS OF MINE AND RELATIVES HAVE SEEN THESE EARRINGS AND LOVE THEM TOO. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS COMPANY'S PRODUCTS EITHER. I THINK THAT LIKE MOST WOMEN-WE ARE LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLITY,LOOKS,COMFORT AND THESE (EARRINGS) HAVE BOTH. I AM ENJOYING THEM ALONG WITH A GREEN MALACHITE PENDANT ON A SILVER CHAIN.

 B000FALCPW  Sterling Silver Circular Sensations Clear Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Simply beautiful  I love this earring, it is even more gorgeous than the picture. I bought it to wear to a wedding since I have the pendant to match. They are so rich together. Absolutely beautiful. <end>  Very pretty!  These were for me. I love them-very pretty/sparkly and not too big. Can be worn with jeans to dresses -just about anything. Would highly recommend! <end>  Earrings are very pretty  They are very pretty and look great on my son's girlfriend, who is 21. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend buying them. <end>  Quality fashion at an affordable price.  The earrings were exactly as pictured. I didn't expect the quality to be so good since the earrings were so affordable. I love wearing them! The dangles make me feel sassy and sexy! <end>  Even more beautiful than the picture!  When I received the earrings and opened the package, I was amazed at how pretty they are! The picture is fairly accurate of them, except that they look even prettier in real life. The little crystals reflect all forms of light, and they stand out in a very classy way. You won't be let down with these earrings, they'll go with lots of different types of outfits, too. <end>  Young & Hip earrings!  These are a great pair of earrings to have in your jewelry wardrobe! They are long, modern and flattering to the face. Can be dressed up or worn every day. They even jingle a little when you move your head! I have given two pairs of these earrings as gifts to a 35 year old and a 51 year old ......both LOVED them!! <end>
 B000FBNIZ8  2.00 Carat Canary Yellow And 2.00 Ct. T.W. White Cz Ring. Size 6 ||	  Pretty ring - fun to wear!  Received this for mother's day...nothing easier for hubby than circling the items I like in the Ross Simons catalog. This ring is very pretty on, just like the picture. Fits well, and tons of sparkle. There is a great deal of wow factor for this ring, I've had lots of comments on it. I like it overall very well, at least until the lotto comes in and I can afford the real deal! <end>
 B000FBPHCA  Sterling Silver Crystal Anklet With Lobster Clasp Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Pretty  This cool anklet was big enough for my chubby ankles! I wore it every day for about 4 months, and it held up well, even stuffed inside my winter socks and boots. The black charm fell off once, but I found it and clamped it on tighter. It feels light and fragile, but I put it through a lot. Wore it in the shower and pool, too, with no issues. Good value! <end>
 B000FBS4RK  Sterling Silver Crystal Pink and Clear Oval Chain Anklet Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  CRYSTAL DELIGHT!  This bracelet is so dainty and feminine, yet strong. The crystals have great clarity and are large enough to stand out, but small enough to not overwhelm the look.The price was a great deal and the delivery was great. I would highly recommend Gem Avenue and have already put several of their items on my Wish List. <end>
 B000FCJ5BI  Sterling Silver Cube Shape Lavender Crystal and Rondelle Beads 8mm x 19mm Pendant Charm Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Very Pretty  I put this on a long sterling silver necklace. It is exactly as pictured and got a lot of compliments. <end>  The only jewelry site you need!!  Gem Avenue is the only jewelry site that I ever use when shopping on Amazon! This pendant in particular is of exceptional quality for the money & the service cannot be beat!! I purchased this for myself and ended up giving it along with the 22 inch silver chain that I purchased also to a friend's 13 year old who had a bad 4-wheeler accident, she loved it! I ended up having to purchase another for the girl's grandmother also who LOVED it also. You cannot go wrong with Gem Avenue & all of their jewelry! <end>  lovely  the crystal is beautiful. I bought this for my cousin's college graduation present, and now I think I am going to have to buy one for myself!! <end>
 B000FCO9SW  Sterling Silver Cube Shape Red Ruby Crystal and Rondelle Beads 8mm x 19mm Pendant Charm Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Very Dainty and Versatile  This pendant is small and dainty. It has a very unusual color in sunlight so its stunning. I like to wear this with other chains of varying lengths. I may order another to wear as earrings also. It would also make a nice gift since its crystal and versatile. It came with a small silver gift box. <end>
 B000FDDV6W  .03 ct Fancy Yellow Diamond 14k White Gold Heart Shaped Pendant (I1 Clarity) ||	  Better in person  I received this necklace as a gift from my husband. I had added it to my wishlist because I thought it was different and I love two tone pendants -- and they are hard to find. I opened the box today and realized that it looks even better in person. I wish the pendant had more yellow gold but I am more than pleased with this item. <end>  Cute  But not quite as big as the advert makes it look. Regardless, a cute, nice piece of jewelery that can go with practically anything. <end>
 B000FDKH14  Loving Family Small Sterling Silver Pendant with Extender - Mother and 4 Children ||	  a good present  it's just like its picture. one thing though, you may think to buy a separate cord. its cord is not stainless steel, corrodes quickly. <end>
 B000FE3K2Q  Amazon.com  Enchanted Heart Bracelet, SILVER, Size 1 SIZE  Clothing ||	  heart bracelet  I really liked this bracelet. It is so dainty and pretty compared to how it looked in the picture. I have lots of compliments on it. <end>
 B000FE7HCA  Vintage Vines Earring Stand (set of 2) ||	  Great product!  My item was shipped quickly and I love the earring tree, it's exactly what I wanted it to be. Good quality and good service. <end>  Cute and handy  These stands are not only cute, but they are stable (don't topple easily)and can hang about 16 pairs of earrings. <end>
 B000FEG3PM  Clearly Charming Boxer Italian Charm ||	  Boxer Charm  I bought this as a gift for a friend and I definitely wasn't disappointed!

 B000FFMVCA  Large Sterling Silver Hand Engraved Rectangular Locket, 7/8 in. X 1 3/16 in. ||	  Memories  My father is very ill and I wanted a locket to place a picture of him in it. I did not want the cutesy heart lockets not to mention very hard to get a picture in it. I liked the square look of this one. It is large to get a really good picture in it so that you do not have to squint to see it. Also it is not very heavy for one's neck. <end>
 B000FFR0CQ  Deep Blue Stone Everyday Ring ||	  Deep Blue Stone Everyday Ring  Loved the way this ring looked online.Hated the way it looked when it arrived.Sent it back IMMEDIATELY after its arrival. <end>
 B000FFSK7K  Small Sterling Silver Hand Engraved Heart Locket, 5/8 in. (16mm) Wide and 5/8 in. (16mm) Tall ||	  very nice  I got this sterling silver locket for my 12 year daughter for Christmas and she loved it.She had a tiny little photo of her baby cousin (that was taken from far away)and it fit perfectly. She just glued it in with regular school glue and it turned out perfect!She often wears the locket with another little pendant on the same chain.I was surprized at how cheap it was because it was sterling silver. <end>  Worst quality ever.  It was the worst quality jewelry I've ever bought. It's not full silver, only plated. The clasp stops working after 9-10 times of opening and closing it. It is pretty but just not worth it. Go to a real jeweler to get a locket. I am returning it. <end>  Perfect for younger sister  I bought this locket for my baby sister (at 10, she hardly is a baby, but still...) and she adores it. She wears it everywhere and keeps it bright, and it has not tarnished yet. I purchased a silver box chain for it925 Sterling Silver 0.9mm Box Chain Necklace for Child Italy 14 Inchand they go well together. If the company which sells these lockets ever decides to take customer monogramming (I monogrammed it myself upon arrival) I feel it would be worth an additional sum just for that.As it is, this is still a great gift at a reasonable price, and I feel it was well worth purchasing. The locket does not fall open, yet it is also easy to open. <end>  No chain  Apparently I must not have understood that the charm comes by itself- No chain included.....I have decided to return this item because I purchased it for my 6 year old cousin....spending $20 on just a charm and then having to purchase a chain as well was more than I wanted to spend for such a young child. I did go back and it doesn't say anything on the page about a chain- I guess I assumed that when I searched for locket necklaces that is what I would have received...The charm looks nice, I just wish I had realized before hand that IT DOES NOT COME WITH A NECKLACE CHAIN. <end>
 B000FFSSW2  Carved Royal Ring ||	  Nice ring  This is a very nice ring that looks great on the hand. It is a bit different from what I expected. It's very light and I thought it would have some heft to it, but I like it. It's delicate and elegant. <end>
 B000FH26IW  Margarita Mega Link Lively Libation Drink Food Theme Charm ||	  sis loved it  Sis' signature drink. When my sister comes for a visit, she calls me about 5 minuts out so hubby can start up the blender! So, when she received this charm in the mail, she thought it was hilarious. I haven't personally seen it yet but she is very happy with it, so I gave the item the benefit of the doubt and gave it 5 stars. It's the nicest maggie charm out there. <end>
 B000FH7YXE  Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball MLB Italian Charm Fully Licensed by ProCharms ||	  Great addition to my mom's italian charm bracelet.  Bought this for my mom for her birthday and she loves it! It's the perfect addition to her collection and it's a fun way to show team spirit. The quality is great and I would highly recommend it for any Braves fan. <end>
 B000FH90JA  Crystal Bands - Sterling Silver Clear and Emerald Swarovski Crystal Band - Size 6 ||	  Tiny Ring  The ring is very nice. But Very Tiny. Small. Molecular. I got a green one and a purple one and I can barely make out the colors on them. No flaws or defects, just small. <end>  Excellent price, Excellent Product  This was the only ring that I ordered for Christmas that didn't get here on time- however, my wife was pleasantly surprised when she got it a few days afterward. It was just what she wanted. <end>

 B000FHA7H4  Carved Cinnabar Butterfly Gold-Tone Beaded Red and Turquoise Blue Tassel Necklace Adjustable 19.5" to 22.5" ||	  butterfly necklace  This is a very nice necklace but I do have one warning. When I wore it the red cinnabar portions left stains on my sweater. The stains did come out when washed. I recommend wearing it with something dark red. <end>
 B000FHAMAG  Pugster Size 9 Citrine & Cz Flower Gift Sterling Silver Jewelry Ring Fashion ||	  an ok product  I honestly expected something a little bigger. The flower does look pretty but it is hard to see since it not big, Also, the thickess of the ring is not exactly what I expected <end>
 B000FHDUOG  Pugster Size 9 Citrine & Cz Flower Gift Sterling Silver Jewelry Ring Fashion ||	  an ok product  I honestly expected something a little bigger. The flower does look pretty but it is hard to see since it not big, Also, the thickess of the ring is not exactly what I expected <end>
 B000FHFOZ4  Pugster Law Scales Italian Charms Bracelet Link ||	  Poor Quality Control  I got this charm from Pugster, and although it would have been beautiful if it had been properly soldered, it was soldered off-center and doesn't look very nice. I wrote a similar review on the Pugster site, and the review was pulled. Every other charm that I've gotten is really quite nice, and the overall idea of a non-dangling charm bracelet that doesn't get in the way of writing or typing is great. It's just a shame that somebody doesn't check on the individual charms as they're packed for shipping. <end>
 B000FHGH64  I Love My Daughter 2 Laser Italian Charm ||	  Nice Looking Italian Charm  I am lucky enough to have two step-daughters and wanted to get them a little something on my own. They really liked them. <end>

 B000FI2A78  Turquoise Blue Pipe Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  another little stretch  This bracelet is a good bargain...it works well with with casual or semi-casual wear...the weight of this 'stretchy' bracelet is its' main selling point...it becomes part of your wrist it's so light. <end>
 B000FI2VPE  Heart Shaped Ruby Earrings in 14kt Yellow Gold ||	  My Valentine's Day present for my wife this year.  These are lovely and she appreciated getting them very much.

 B000FI3ZMC  Mirror Work Ethnic Cuff Bracelet ||	  Mirror Work Ethnic Cuff Bracelet  This is a great bracelet. You can tell it is handmade, and that is part of the charm of a bracelet like this. I'm glad I bought it. I would definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  Kinda Cheap, but fun  This product is cheap-looking. Like something you might buy at a county fair. My wife wears it occasionally for fun--but I wouldn't recommend it. <end>
 B000FI598A  Schnauzer Laser Italian Charm ||	  Incorrectly sold  This product is sold as a Schnauzer, but is really a Scottish Terrier. I felt cheated! <end>
 B000FI5P52  Large Round Disc Celtic Knot Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  Nice earrings!  I think the earrings are really nice, however I expected them to be flat discs (to match the necklace I have), but they were bowed. Still a great bargain! <end>  Nice pair of earrings, but...  I do wear these earrings. They are fairly good sized and lightweight. I didn't care for the concave given to the back section. I would have much preferred they were a little heavier and flat - especially for the price. Although I'm not sorry I purchased them, I'm sure I would have purchased something else if I had seen them in person at a store, jewelry case, etc. <end>  GREAT EARRINGS  I bought these earrings for my three daughters. They love celtic things and wear these all the time with much joy. I'm glad I saw them featured on the home page on Amazon. Great buy!! <end>  Celtic Knot Sterling Silver Earrings  I am used to very lightweight earrings, and by 3PM, I really know I have them on, however they are beautiful and I have gotten many compliments on them! <end>

 B000FIJ8HI  I Heart My Boys Red Heart Laser Italian Charm ||	  Very Happy  I ordered this Italian Charm to add to a bracelet I already owned. I was very pleased with the item and the company that handled my order. These type of charms are rare and difficult to find. I was so happy when I found that the Italian Charms were still available. I just placed another order from this company today, and have several other charms I plan to order in the near future. Good quality charm....does not tarnish....perfect for these who like to personalize their bracelets. I have one for everyday use and plan to build one for every holiday. Thank You! <end>

 B000FIK6YC  Rembrandt Charms CN Tower Charm ||	  Not what I expected  Got 7 CN Tower charms for a ladies group. The quality of the silver charms is not what I expected. They seem rather inferior in quality. No time to make a return on the product so just have to live with my purchase. <end>
 B000FIK87W  Rembrandt Charms Bi-Plane Charm ||	  The recipient of this Christmas gift loved the charm!  This charm was carefully chosen to give as a gift.The Bi-plane honors the passing of a family member that was a RC airplane enthusiast.The recipient was touched by the detail and the size of the item to take its place on her cherished charm bracelet.Love that Rembrandt offers charms in a selection of finishes to suit recipient. <end>

 B000FIKDLI  Rembrandt Charms Buddha Charm ||	  Beautiful!!!!  I absolutely LOVE this little charm. I wear it on a snake like white gold chain everyday and it's just beautiful! Quite small, a little bit smaller than I expected but looks great. As must as I've worn this charm it hasn't got the slightest scratch or lost it's glow. Definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to have a little reminder of the Buddha to rub on and pray to throughout the day. I find it works great for mini meditation moments when at work or walking. <end>
 B000FIKE44  Rembrandt Charms Gondola Charm ||	  Nicely Detailed Charm  I decided to spend an extra dollar or two for this charm, hoping that it would be better quality than some of the others that were available. I am glad I did, because this charm is very nicely detailed. My wife was pleased with my purchase, so that made it all worth while. <end>
 B000FIN7NO  Solid 14kt Yellow Gold Cubic Zirconia Ladybug Belly Ring ||	  Very Cute, but over priced  As you can see, it's an adorable belly ring but I was a bit dissappointed that the lady bug is hollow. Also, the bar is long, so it's hard to situate it comfortably... I would have returned it just for that (Because for $100, I want to be downright thrilled about my purchase) but Body Candy DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS... so purchase cautiously. <end>
 B000FINGT4  Rembrandt Charms Apple Charm ||	  A Very Beautiful charm.  the picture only gets close to how beautiful this charm is. It seems really solid and my GF loved it!only thing i noticed is that the charm is so very bright, which inst a bad thing, it may be because its new, but this charm made all her others seem dull. <end>  Lovely apple charm  I purchased this apple charm for my daughter's Twilight charm bracelet and couldn't be more pleased. Lovely charm, and Precious Accents was a pleasure to deal with. And you can't beat the free shipping! <end>

The item shipped well within the promised time frame, and was also free. I had absolutely no difficulties with being charged the wrong amount. The person who received the charm said that it is cute, and I can highly recommend ordering from this seller. <end>

 B000FIO1T8  Rembrandt Charms Penguin Charm ||	  pretty  it is beautiful, but got dirty very fast! I'm still trying to clean it with the right stuff, but it's worth it, b/c it's gorgeous and a wonderful size. And too adorable. <end>
 B000FIO20G  Rembrandt Charms Washington D.C. Charm ||	  Very pretty, but hard to read for older eyes  My mom absolutely loved it after she went and got her glasses and strained to read what it said. Otherwise, it's high-quality and beautiful. <end>
 B000FIO26A  Rembrandt Charms San Antonio Charm ||	  Ghosty gift  I bought this charm for my granddaughter's 18th birthday, we visit a different city for her birthday every year and last year it was San Antonio. She loved it! <end>
 B000FIO29C  Rembrandt Charms Rose Charm ||	  small  This is a very small charm. It does not come with a clasp - I had to bend it open (needle nose pliers) and onto my wife's bracelet. The first one I received was missing the stone altogether. However, the customer service was nice and sent out a replacement quickly. Would buy again. <end>
 B000FIO2YW  Rembrandt Charms Las Vegas Charm ||	  Charm - Las Vegas  This is only one of 6 other charms that I recently purchased and had sent to NZ. They are absolutely perfect and arrived securely packaged. Thank you so much. I will be purchasing more charms from you. <end>

She likes it because it reminds her of her trips here. <end>  Absolutely Exquisite Charm!  I lived in Belgium for many years and have since returned to the USA. I was looking for something as a reminder of the country I grew to love so very much. This charm is absolutely beautifully crafted and I am extremely pleased with it. I wear it on a chain as a necklace however some may prefer to place it on a bracelet. It is the perfect size to do either, actually. I highly recommend this Seller to others. Thank you!!!! <end>
 B000FIO5O4  Rembrandt Charms St. Michael Charm ||	  You get what you pay for  When I received the package I opened the case and my stomach dropped. What I saw was a tiny, highly polished, shiny little charm. Almost too shiny to see the emblem. I bought it for my girlfriend and could see the disappointment in her eyes. Save up your money and get a bigger one. They have nicer pewter ones at religious stores if you can find one in your area. The large, silver ones like this cost an arm and a leg. <end>
 B000FIO7KQ  Rembrandt Charms Witch Charm ||	  Seller did not send it!  My dad had ordered this for me not once but twice and the product never came! It looks beautiful and something I would thoroughly enjoy since Halloween is one of my favorite holidays. I wish I could provide a better review, but no product to effectively review. Thoroughly disappointed with this seller. My dad felt bad about not having this for me for Christmas, and I felt bad for him because he really tried to deliver. I am an avid amazon customer and of the hundred items I have bought, this is the first and hopefully only poor review I will write. <end>  Beautiful, little witch  I purchased this for my daughter after she read a book about the Wicked Witch of Oz. She is delighted with it. <end>
 B000FIO7VU  Rembrandt Charms Pickle Charm ||	  Great gift!  I was stumped for a birthday gift for my 77 year old mom. She's essentially an invalid, so the usual stuff was out. When I was a child, she used to sing the song I Love You a Bushel and a Peck (date yourselves, readers!), and somehow I tacked on a "whole and a pickle." Well, this pickle was perfect! She wears it on a fine cord, and now she always knows how much I love her. She was tickled pink! Quality is good, delivery was speedy, price was right. <end>  not a long lasting pickle  Bought this charm for my daughter, it lasted one day before a trip to the jeweler, then a day after the trip to the jeweler the top sheared off so there is no ring to attach it to the bracelet. I paid for expedited shipping to make sure it was here a few days before the big day, and the day before the big day I was sweating till it arrived. Not a happy camper, the service was sub par and the charm itself left me frustrated and my daughter without a charm. <end>  pickle charm sterling silver  The item was exactly what I was looking for and the price was great. I will definitely use Amazon again when searching for unusual products. <end>
 B000FIO8LE  Rembrandt Charms Matryoshka Doll Charm ||	  Matryoshka doll charm  This SS Matryoshka doll charm is just too cute! It's a nice size and has lots of detail. Rembrandt charms are great! <end>  Babushka doll charm  Very cute, very fine detail and good quality charm. Was not aware the inside was hollow, but still solid and strong enough not to worry about damaging it easily. <end>  Great quality and unique design  I like Matryoshka Dolls in general very much and was very excited when I finally found this charm. The price was justified because of the high quality. The charm has a lot of detail. I did not put it on my charm bracelet yet. I was wearing it on my necklace a few times but people cannot see what it is and then they just seem confused. In other words, it is not suitable for a necklace, it does not look pretty from the distance but it is great for charm bracelets. I would buy it again and might even buy another as a gift. I have a few Rembrandt charms and am happy with their quality and design. <end>  no problem  I received exactly what i ordered in plenty time for christmas.'No problems at all!thank you earl <end>
 B000FIOBWK  Rembrandt Charms Scissors Charm ||	  Great little charm...  My wife is a hair stylist and she was absolutely thrilled with this charm. It is a great looking piece that actually opens and closes like real scissors! It was a big hit with her as I am sure it would be for anyone. I would highly recommend this charm! <end>  Friend Loved it  My friend loved her charm. She saw a member of a rock band wearing it when she went to a concert and just had to have it. I got it for her for Xmas and she wears it every day. <end>
 B000FIOF0S  Rembrandt Charms Mustard Seeds Charm ||	  Amazing  High polished and larger than I expected it to. My sister loves it and the message of mustard seeds. Definitely would recommend for purchase. Plus comes with a lifetime guarantee. <end>
 B000FIOVHA  Rembrandt Charms Lobster Trap Charm ||	  so cute  Bought this for my mother-in-law. She loved it and is so cute. The lobster is a separate piece that moved inside.Goes great with all her other unique charms <end>
 B000FIOVHU  Rembrandt Charms World Trade Center Charm ||	  Nice charm  This World Trade Center charm is what I was looking for. It is a nice piece, big enough to be noticed on a bracelet, nicely detailed. <end>
 B000FIPEYE  Rembrandt Charms I Love You Charm ||	  Wonderful items & fast delivery!  If you can't find what you need here, you'll never find it!! Adorable items, fast delivery, and wonderful service. I'll use this site again. Too, too cool. Thanks. <end>  A great little charm/pendant  I had not found a charm like this and had been looking. I ordered it on Amazon, it was here fast and just exactly what I wanted. <end>  not good  Incredibly weak. Fell off repeatedly.. then finally lost it. Bracelet has several charms but this one is very cheaply made. Incredibly disappointed. <end>  Cute Charm  This is a great little charm. Note that it is very small, probably 1/2 inch, but the detail is really great.I read a poster talking about the jump ring that comes with it. My solution is to buy 10mm lobster claw clasps and split rings for charms on Amazon. I've lost charms using only a jump ring, and replacing it with the split ring seems to solve the problem.I really like doing business with this seller. Very quick delivery, accurate, and no shipping charges. I can buy Rembrandt charms elsewhere but I prefer to use this company. <end>  Gift for Grandmother chosen by Nephew  My nephew picked this out for his Grandmother. It was perfect-reflected the choice of an 18yr old. There were no obvious seams from the manufacturing process. No flaws at all in the item. It was very polished & shiney. The size was perfect for her Sterling Silver charm bracelet. This was a high quality product for a good price reflecting the personality & age of the giver. Grandmother was very pleased. She did not know what the hand gesture meant & she enjoyed their discussion about the choice. <end>  Great charm!  Great charm, solid construction; fits the bracelet I bought from Blue Nile without issue. The seller shipped very quickly and I will not hesitate to purchase from them again in the future. <end>  Small and cute  Looks just like the picture just a little smaller. Note the size is 1/2". I like the uniqueness and daintiness of it. It is a three dimensional charm. Would've preferred for it to have a spring ring clasp or lobster claw clasp so that I could hook it onto different charm bracelets. <end>  Perfect!  This charm is the perfect size and a great addition to my theme bracelet. The charm itself can also be worn as a pendant. It looks exactly like the picture only smaller. Service was prompt. I couldn't be more pleased. Because of the great variety, I have chosen a few more for my next bracelet. <end>

 B000FIPH2I  Rembrandt Charms Mom Charm ||	  Very pretty and good price  I got this for someone as a gift and was very impressed at how nice it was for the price. <end>
 B000FIPHDM  Rembrandt Charms Scorpio Charm ||	  Cute  This is a very cute pendant. It's tastefully done. I only wish it was pure gold instead of gold plated silver. However overall, I still like it and would recommend it to a friend. <end>
 B000FIPIFE  Rembrandt Charms Meat Cleaver Charm ||	  Except that the hole should be on the other side!  See for example this one...J.A. Henckels International Classic Stainless-Steel Meat Cleaver <end>
 B000FIPIQS  Rembrandt Charms Two Turtle Doves Charm ||	  Cute  It's a cute charm and the quality is good. The only problem was the wrapping. It came in a small, stapled, and torn paper envelope. <end>
 B000FIPIU4  Rembrandt Charms Ring Box Charm ||	  Right for the occasion  Every Valentine's day since I have known my wife I have given her a charm that reflects some event from the previous year. I gave her this charm the year I proposed to her. When we bought our house I gave her a house charm and when we got married I gave her a wedding cake charm, etc. This was perfect for the occasion and is beautiful. I like the 3d charms and she is always pleased. Service was great and charms have always arrived on time. <end>
 B000FIPJQ2  Rembrandt Charms Hockey Skate Charm ||	  sterling silver hockey skate  made me smile as soon as i opened the package - what an amazing piece of hockey jewelry!!! love the detail even in such a small item - love it love it!!!! <end>
 B000FIPL2O  Rembrandt Charms Sunflower Charm ||	  Beautiful and detailed  This little charm really surprised me. It is quite detailed and well made. It appears to be "diamond cut" so that it has just the right amount of shine, along with the detail. It was made in Canada. The sunflower has recently gained special sentimental value to my family. When my 15 year old daughter saw this charm she said right away that she had to have one too. Consequently, I just ordered another one! <end>
 B000FIPL6A  Rembrandt Charms Marathon Charm ||	  Nice!  This charm is exactly as pictured! What you can't see in the picture is that it is nice and weighty ~ not cheap like some charms. I wear it as a pendant on a chain with a few charms. It reminds me of my accomplishment! <end>

It's so detailed compared to all of the others that I compared it to. Thanks! <end>  Most attractive Lion charm  I purchased this Lion charm for my daughter's Twilight charm bracelet and it is the most attractive Lion charm I have found. Precious Accents is also a pleasure to deal with and you can't beat the free shipping. <end>
 B000FIPOE4  Rembrandt Charms Cow Charm ||	  Best Charm Company  Rembrandt charms are very high quality with excellent detail. Also huge selection. I purchased a number of gold plated silver animal charms for a friend and she is pleased with all of them. Highly recommend. <end>
 B000FIPP4S  Rembrandt Charms Field Hockey Charm ||	  Good Quality-Fast Shipping  This is a good quality product-shipping was fast, and the whole order was very easy, just what I needed during the holidays. <end>
 B000FIPP8O  Rembrandt Charms Owl Charm ||	  Perfect size owl pendant  I have 2 of these because I do lose them- usually when I have them on a long chain and I try on stuff in a dressing room and it comes off. The last one I bought was the third! Rembrandt makes great quality charms, and I like that this owl is cut out so that you can really see what it is. It is very nice. <end>
 B000FIPPSO  Rembrandt Charms Lion Charm ||	  Rampant Lion Charm  This Lion is perfect for someone who's looking for something that could be found on a family crest or if they just wanted something classic.It's the prefect size for a charm bracelet, and it's extrememely light weight!It took me forever to find just the right lion, because I wanted it to represent a part of my family crest, and I am extrememly impressed with it's detail!I recommend the sterling silver charm because it has a lower price than the others, and it is less likely that you will have an alergic reaction to it, if you have any metal allergies.Many people are not even aware that there are others that have these allergies; I'm actually alergic to nickel, so I tend to shy away from the cheaper metals. A friend of mine is allergic to all metal; gold, silver, the works!The best thing to get people who are alergic to metals is magnatite. It's a magnetic stone, and if you can find the right design, it's the perfect gift.If you had wanted this charm for someone who has metal allergies, you could possibly put it on a key-chain or something that won't touch the skin very often.Just make sure you tell them what type of metal it is. Usually, if you're allergic to the metal, you'll know. If not you'll find out soon enough, and the best way to take care of it depends on how serious of a reaction you have. I don't have a serious reaction to nickel, and can just put some aloe vera on the irritated area to stop the itching.But, back to the item, The Rampant Lion charm... It's small, and extrememly shiny, and the little piece between the tail and body that appears to be a little silvery, is probably the bakground, because there's actually nothing there on the real thing.This piece is simply gorgeous and I would recommend it highly to anyone! <end>
 B000FIPRR8  Rembrandt Charms Key Charm ||	  Nice  Very nice charm. It is true to the size in the description,and made a pretty addition to my niece's charm bracelet. <end>
 B000FIQPC4  Clearly Charming Inspired Expressions Reversible Silver Bracelet ||	  Poor Quality  My grandmother gave this to me last year, and I loved it. It tarnished quickly, and when I tried to clean it, the black coloring in the word engraving came off. Pretty bracelet in the box. <end>  Charming Bracelet  I love this bracelet. First saw it at Hallmark, then wanted another for my sister. I am a writer, so I am all about words and inspiration -- this bracelet is perfect! <end>  Nice  Nice bracelet for the price. Good for gifts for friends (which is what I purchased them for) Everyone was very happy with them. <end>  Great inspirational gift!  Bought several of these bracelets for Christmas gifts! They were a big hit! Perfect for someone who need a little pick me up! <end>
 B000FIRAOG  Rembrandt Charms Hummingbird Charm ||	  Nice hummer  I have looked all over for a pretty hummingbird charm, and this one satisfies me. It is 3-D (not hollow or flat on the backside) which looks nice on a bracelet. I recommend it. <end>
 B000FIRB7C  Rembrandt Charms Snowman Charm ||	  Cute, But...  Cute little charm but I was a bit disappointed that mine does not have the colored detail portrayed in the photo. Mine is all sterling silver. I like it enough to keep it, but the photo is misleading.I have purchased multiple charms from this seller and have generally been satisfied with them. <end>  Adorable and Perfect!  Absoutely perfect for a christmas gift. Gave it to my mom for her charm bracelet to symbolize christmas without it being to "christmas-y" so I thought the snowman was perfect since it also symbolized winter. He was the perfect size and I liked him too because he doesn't have anything on him that is going to get caught on your sweaters or anything else. So cute! <end>
 B000FIRBK4  Rembrandt Charms Baseball & Bats Charm ||	  Very satisfied  The quality of the baseball charm is that of a much mote expensive piece. The mounting ring is large enough to accommodate a medium size leather necklace. <end>
 B000FIRCBC  Rembrandt Charms Heart Charm ||	  Good Product  The product is as advertised, a little smaller than the image may lead you to believe but in the end ideal for use on a charm bracelet. I am well satisfied by the charm. <end>  Pretty heart charm  I purchased this heart charm for my daughter's Twilight bracelet and it is very pretty and delicate. <end>
 B000FIRDH0  Rembrandt Charms Crochet Hook Charm ||	  unique  Nobody I know ever saw it, I love to show one of my interests with it on. A bit bigger would be perfect  so small is nice, but it's too slim to appreciate the meaning. What about more materials? <end>  cute charm  This was exactly what I was looking for to give to my mother for her birthday We both crochet so it was perfect. <end>
 B000FIREF6  Rembrandt Charms Wine Glass Charm ||	  For the Wine Lover  The charm was as ordered and looked great. Very nice little charm, still hard to believe it cost as much as it did. But I guess you have to pay for quality and for gold. <end>
 B000FIRH2Q  Rembrandt Charms Nurse Practitioner Charm ||	  Charm not big enough  The charm was very deceiving when I ordered. It is very small, not at all what I expected. Picture shown for item is MUCH bigger than actual charm. <end>
 B000FIRIAC  Rembrandt Charms Bells Charm ||	  Almost lost it  Well charms certainly have changed. No time to reorder something else, I gave this as a give, but it embarrassed me to do so. Sooooooooo tiny it almost went out with the wrapping. No room to engrave even a year on it. Purchased in White Gold the price was not cheap, but I'm sure the gift came across as a gum machine trinket. Too Bad . . . <end>
 B000FIRMZS  Rembrandt Charms Praying Hands Charm ||	  Very Nice  This charm is very nice. Its just what I wanted. I wear it on a chain with a cross charm to remind me to pray. <end>
 B000FIRNL6  Rembrandt Charms Registered Nurse Charm ||	  A little small, but nice...  It was a little smaller than i was expecting (although looking now it does say it's .55 inches). I got the White Gold and the metal looks very nice. The back of the charm is flat, FYI. The craftsmanship is unmatched as i spent hours looking for a good looking RN Necklace for my girlfriend..this is by far the best crafted one that I could find. It doesn't come with a chain or a nice box either, just in a little wax bag.Overall, a little pricey but, then again, I don't know much about Jewelry...the real critic will be my girlfriend when i give it to her for V-day.. <end>
 B000FIRORY  Rembrandt Charms Maple Leaf Charm ||	  Rembrandt Sterling Maple Leaf Charm is beautifully detailed  The charms (I also purchased a sterling handbell) I purchased have beautiful engraving that lends great detail. It arrived well protected, quicker than quoted, with packaging appropriate for gift giving. Great merchant, easy transaction and discounted shipping for multiple items.Rembrant Charms are the only charms I will buy (I used to work for a jeweler) because of their beauty and durability.Merchant made holiday shopping a breeze, I'll be back. <end>
 B000FISKCM  Clearly Charming August Peridot Color Butterfly Birthstone Insect Animal Italian Charm ||	  A little more Kelly green than expected but still very pretty  I bought the August butterfly charm to represent the month my boyfriend was born. It's very pretty but more of a kelly green than Peridot green, but I still really like it. <end>
 B000FISKCW  Clearly Charming September Sapphire Color Butterfly Birthstone Insect Animal Italian Charm ||	  Fell Apart  I bought a few charms from another vendor than Pugster and they literally fell apart. I was putting the charm onto my bracelet when the butterfuly fell off! It looked like they had glued it with a tiny amount of glue. The vendor did refund my money. But it was disappointing since I the blue butterfuly was pretty. The other charm was for my dog. Same thing happened the top part fell off... <end>  beautiful!  I bought this to go with a bracelet for my daughter for christmas. It was much easier to put together than I thought it would be. Everything came quickly and in good shape. <end>
 B000FISZSG  Rembrandt Charms Chess Knight Charm ||	  Rembrandt charms are high quality  Adorable charm for my chess-playing niece. Beautiful detail, nice weight and size. After starting her charm bracelet with this brand, it is now the only brand I would buy. I prefer the charms with the lobster clasp because they are easy to arrange on the chain. But some of their charms only have the O-ring attacher. <end>
 B000FIT05S  Rembrandt Charms Female Swimmer Charm ||	  Nice Item - delivered as promised  As promised and dipicted. The extra $10 for shipping got it there right away. <end>
 B000FIYBT8  Heart Charm Cubic Zirconia Anklet ||	  looked great but poor quality  I bought this bracelet for my wife, and it is a great design but has already broken twice. my wife never did take it off so that might have been the problem. i wish is was made out of some stronger material. <end>
 B000FJ2IHY  August Birthstone, Natural Peridot 1/2 Carat (5mm) Size Brilliant Cut Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver Basket Setting ||	  Very Lovely Peridot Earrings  These earrings were even better than I expected. Just the right size, not too big, not too small. Good quality. I wear them a lot. Glad I bought them. <end>  sterling peridot earrings  This is a very good product for the price, the stones are very good quality. I would recommend this item. <end>
 B000FJ2IIS  January Birthstone, Natural Garnet 3/4 Carat (5mm) Size Princess Cut Square Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver Basket Setting ||	  Excellent Quality and Value  These sterling silver, princess cut garnet earrings were a gift for my daughter, and we are both very pleased with them. The quality is excellent and the price was less than anything similar at even Wal-Mart. <end>  LOVELY  I got this as a gift for someone dear to me. They were exactly what I wished them to be. <end>
 B000FJ2IJC  February Birthstone, Natural Amethyst 1 1/4 Carat (6mm) Size Princess Cut Square Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver Basket Setting ||	  great quality  It was hard to tell the quality online, but these earrings are beautiful! <end>  amethyst stud earrings  The earrings were pretty.

Also thank you for the quick response on getting them to me. <end>
 B000FJ4BQ0  January Birthstone, Natural Garnet 1 Carat (6mm) Size Brilliant Cut Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver Basket Setting ||	  Beautiful quality  The quality of these earrings is absolutely amazing! They were a little bit bigger than I thought they would be, but they are very lightweight, so they don't drag down on your earlobes. The gemstone color is exquisite, and although they are a bit larger than the average stud, they fit with casual wear. <end>
 B000FJ4BQA  August Birthstone, Natural Peridot 1 Carat (6mm) Size Brilliant Cut Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver Basket Setting ||	  My sister loves them!  These made a nice B-day gift. My sister loves them.Nice size, color and sparkle. <end>  Not as great as I hoped  I purchased these earrings as a Christmas present. The price was really low and the quality wasn't as good as I hoped. I guess you get what you pay for. <end>  The best deal around!  I just brought earrings 3mm for 29.99 on sale! this deal blew that away. <end>
 B000FJ4BQK  December Birthstone, Natural Blue Topaz 1 Carat (6mm) Size Brilliant Cut Stud Earrings in Sterling Silver Basket Setting ||	  Beautiful!  I love these so much that, after being given to me as a gift, then losing one, I had to order another pair. Thankfully my friend still had the sellers information so I could! <end>
 B000FJ9IQS  Sterling Silver Italian Flat Mariner Link Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 3mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  arrived on time has not tarnished  I have had this over a year. It has not tarnished and looks smart, delicate and understated <end>
 B000FJGJ1A  Simmons Jewelry Co. Men's Dogtag ||	  Dog Tag  I really think its nice. I brought this for my husband. Atleast he has taken off the other one, and put this on. <end>  Great Dog Tag!!  Well, this was for my 16 year old son and he loves it!! He wears it all the time!! This is the "cool" thing to have at this age!! He was very impressed by it's shine/appearance and would recommend it to other teenagers I bet. <end>
 B000FJLXP2  Emerg Alert Men's Deluxe Silver Tone Flexible Band Medical ID Bracelet ||	  Really nice, and more info space.  This was bought to replace husbands old one and it is really nice. The best part is the info paper inside, it holds twice the information his old one held from name, blood type, miscell. inform, doctors name etc. <end>
 B000FK9KQK  Sterling Silver Black Resin Dome Ring with Circular Pattern size 9 ||	  Liked it so much - I bought 2  I am bad about surprises, so Christmas is especially difficult for me. I bought this ring for my mom, and because I really thought she would like it, I convinced her to open the present early. She tried it on, and unfortunately it was a bit too small. I told her I would send it back, and get a bigger size. I ended up liking it myself, and it fit me, so I kept it for me and ordered her a larger size. I don't normally wear large rings, but this one is not overbearing. The only draw back- my mother and I now have the same ring- we're like the Wonder Twins! <end>
 B000FKBNF6  Sterling Silver Leaf Design Black Resin Ring with Cubic Zirconia Stones size 7 ||	  Great accessory!  I bought this ring because I already owned some onyx and black jewelry that I thought would go perfect with this ring. I was right!! This ring is actually very pretty! Good buy! <end>
 B000FKD8KE  Sterling Silver Black Resin Flat Band with Cubic Zirconia Stones ||	  Very Cool  I love the interesting combination of this ring. It is one of my favorites. Simple yet elegant. <end>
 B000FKD98K  Sterling Silver Swirl Emerald Green Resin Flat Band ||	  Lost Brilliance  This silver and emerald resin swirl ring is a nice conversation piece. When held up in the light, the emerald green resin is a rich and vibrant hue. However, the richness of the color is only enhanced when caught by the rays of light. Unfortunately, once the ring is placed on your finger, the clear-see-thru green color becomes a dark green more akin to jade and immedietly looses it's brilliance and clarity.The ring will always look nice, but don't expect the color you see in the photo unless your holding it up to the light. <end>  Pretty in Green  This ring looks nice on or off your hand. The green looks darker when you are wearing it, but it's still a pretty green. This ring would be a nice gift for either a man or woman. It's thick enough to look masculine but the swirls add a touch of feminine. One draw back  If you have short fingers like me this wide ring makes them look even shorter! The box it came in was nothing special. Find a nicer box if giving as a gift. <end>  Nice rich bright green  I don't know what the previous poster was saying about this ring, because I have gotten 3 of them (for friends and myself) and they are exactly the same bottle green on as in the picture. Maybe if your skin is really dark it wouldn't show up? Very pretty ring <end>
 B000FKPY0G  Medium Dual Finish Titanium Ring (size  10) ||	  Exactly what it said it was  This ring was exactly how the write up described it. I have worn it everyday since I got it. <end>
 B000FKTJ1G  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Wedding Band / Thumb Ring, 1/4 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Another ring for my daughter...  I bought this ring for my daughter and she loves it! It is much better quality than the other rings she had been wearing, and it is a nice reminder of our Celtic heritage.I would purchase this one again! <end>  VERY nice  This is a beautiful ring. Well made and has a brilliant finish. I definately will recomend this to anyone looking for a sterling silver ring. <end>  Beautiful  Beautiful but fragile. Bends easily, but this is to be expected with thin silver jewelry. <end>  Love Celtic things  I received this ring and put it on right away. I had it on less than a day and I got a green spot on my finger from the solid band on the bottom. It has been a few days and the green spot has gone away. Other than that, I love the design. Wear it all the time. Something that I bought myself. <end>  a wonderful piece of jewlery  I will use this shop again the ring is just beautiful and I've actually gotten complements about it.Thank you <end>
 B000FKYTKM  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Wedding Band / Thumb Ring, 1/4 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  As always, you get what you pay for  Much lower quality than pictured. It looks like a cheap cut-out. I didn't expect much for $11, but this is borderline false advertising. <end>
 B000FKZ8MK  Sterling Silver Elephant Link Wedding Band Ring 7/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  I love this! Sooo shiny!  I just received this ring in the mail today, and oh my gosh, I love it so much! Its stamped 925 in the inside even though its kinda hard to read but its there! Its shiny and it looks SO cute! I absolutely love it! Would definitely recommend this! <end>  Awesome  One of my favorite rings ever. I was nervous about ordering a ring online but this was perfect. sizing and everything. <end>  elephant band ring  its really nice. it looks even nicer when its in front of you than the picture <end>
 B000FL06P8  Sterling Silver Freeform Cut-out Ring 1/2 inch wide, sizes 6 - 13 ||	  Great value  Very stylish, cleans up well with silver polishing cloth, still looks brand new. Quick delivery and good quality. <end>
 B000FL06SU  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Wedding Band / Thumb Ring, 1/2 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Makes a Nice Statement  This ring is an eye catcher in addition to being comfortable to wear. Already had many compliments on it! My teenage daughter asks to wear it as well. <end>
 B000FL06XA  Sterling Silver Thin Swirl Wedding Band Ring, sizes 6 - 10, 1/8 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Turned my thumb green  I purchased this item as a thumb ring and thought it was very cute. When I opened the package I noticed it was much thinner than I expected by looking at the picture, but it wasn't a big deal, it was still very pretty and I liked it just as much. I was also very pleased that I had received it earlier than the estimated date. Unfortunately, the next night I took it off before going to bed and my thumb was green. I am very disappointed because it was such a nice ring and I was looking forward to wearing it all the time. I have bought several rings from this particular seller in the past, (7 all together to be exact), and wear almost all of them everyday. This was the only one that has ever turned my finger green. Very disappointed. <end>  Love this ring!  My wife purchased this on my account. Here is her review I absolutely ADORE this simple ring! Narrow, yet sturdy and very comfortable. Basic design is attractive and goes with everything. I purchased it to go on my middle finger, but also like wearing it on my forefinger and sometimes my thumb. I wear it nearly every day and it has never turned my skin any weird colors. <end>  Love this ring.  Love this ring. The sizes run alittle small but it is a fun ring to add to any stack collection. <end>  Not bad.  This is a nice simple band, the swirls are laid on well. With no sharp edges to catch on stuff. Also, this is pretty narrow, very delicate looking.For the price I couldn't expect much better. <end>  Pretty ring, good for mixing  This ring was purchased with a bunch of others and is the one my teenaged girls fight over the most...It is very narrow and mixes well with many other sterling rings....good for the stacked multi-ring look. <end>
 B000FL06YY  Sterling Silver Double Rose Flower Ring 5/8 inch wide, size 9.5 ||	  not good.  i bought this 6-size ring, the flower looks too big and too coarse, and its color is not exactly as shown in the picture.it's just not refined at all. both my sister and I dislike it. i bought it for months, and it still sits in my draw. it just doesn't look nice on a finger.don't buy it. <end>  Sterling Silver Flower ring  The ring was beautiful. The detail was perfect. It was a good price for the quality. <end>  Word Cannot Describe...  ...just how much I love this ring. Is there a reason I can't give more than five stars?It looks so delicate and dainty, but it holds up amazingly well. In my opinion, it looks even better than the picture showed. It's very feminine and the detail is wonderful. Just gorgeous. I've already gotten so many compliments on it that you wouldn't even believe.The sizing is exact. I'm surprised it's not more expensive. If you're thinking about ordering this ring, stop thinking and buy it. I've been searching high and low for a pretty, inexpensive ring made out of a metal that won't turn my finger a weird color, and this one is perfect.It arrived three business days after ordering. Sabrina Silver is aces in my book.*FAIR WARNING  There wasn't much "Antiqued Finished" like in the description. It's very shiny and polished. Personally, I was relieved by that. But if you're expecting much darker grooves in the leaves and petals, you might be disappointed. <end>  Beautiful  I really love this ring, I just got it and it is beautiful and looks very well made...sturdy but delicate. I love it! <end>  Good product, Bad company  I had bought this as a promise ring, but it arrived a week after I was supposed to get it. It was too late to give it to my girlfriend because she went back to college two days before I actually received it. I contacted the company and they gave me a cookie cutter apology that upset me. <end>  Cute, Little Ring  This is a cute, little ring, maybe more appropriate for a younger girl. It's attractive, is not cheap looking, and was well worth the money. <end>  Silver Ring  Disapointed when I first got the ring in my hand.The flower is much more flat compared to the vivid look on the picture. The color is way different from what it looks on the picture as well, much brighter. This makes the ring looks un-balanced and cheap.I won't order it if I had ever a chance to put it on my finger.Won't bother to return though as I've already paid $5 for S&H;. <end>  perfect ring  i bought both the rose ring and the stud rose earrings i love them they are well made and very nice i will buy from them again <end>  I am very satisfied  This is an amizing product for such a low price!!!!!! I got this for my Mom for Valentines Day, it came fast within 3 days it is very beautiful!!! It came in a little silver box and a little plastic baggie which cept it very protected!! TEN THUMBS UP!!!! <end>  Beauty at an affordable price.  I purchased a Sterling Silver Flower Ring from Amazon and have had so many compliments on it! The detail in the flowers areexceptional and does not tarnish with wear. It looks like I paid alot for it, but it was very reasonable. I love to shop withAmazon because I am always satisfied with all my purchases. Don't miss this line of jewelery from Sabrina Silver, she deliversfast and stands by her products. <end>  Check Plus  My friend and I decided that we wanted to get friendship rings. When we saw this ring, we knew it was perfect. [...]. It came in a pretty little box and bubble-wrapped. When I opened the ring, it looks just as pretty as when I first saw it. Their is a somewhat antiqued finish, but not too much.The ring sizing is exact, and it fits very nicely. It also does not turn my finger funny colors like other rings, and as I am paticularly hard on my jewelery, it is very strong. You would be led to believe that intracite details would be more prone to breaking, however that is completely incorrect in this case.[...]. <end>
 B000FL071Q  Sterling Silver Dolphin Double Dolphin Polished Ring 3/8 wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  A Classy Ring  This is a very comfortable ring that looks great and is worth the money! I do wish it could be available in larger sizes also, but it is good that it was available in size 10. <end>
 B000FL1E0Y  Sterling Silver Cable Chain Link Wedding Band Ring 3/16 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Quality!  I bought this ring several years ago. I put it on my thumb, and have never taken it off! I have gotten more compliments on this ring than I can count. I have severe metal allergies and can take the finish off of a plated piece, and even have had problems with so called solid sterling silver. It still looks brand new!! My favorite. <end>  Best of the best ring  I have really liked the ring since receiving it. It looks much better on an fits so perfectly. Most rings that I buy don't fit right but this one fits great. <end>
 B000FL1EAY  Sterling Silver Frog Link Ring 1/4 inch wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  GREAT!  I love this ring! I love frogs and this frog ring is very well made. My favorite ring and I wear it all the time. <end>
 B000FL3GM8  Sterling Silver Polished Fork Ring, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  interesting attention getter  I get a lot of compliments on this ring!! as you can see, it's just an interesting, neat ring. Only thing is the sizes are a little small. I ordered a size six for my middle finger, and it wont fit at all. but it fits nicely on my ring finger, which is a 5. i contacted the seller, and she said she would ship me a replacement once i returned the ring. But, i decided to keep the smaller size b/c it just looks so nice. It's just nice to know they are accommodating. Also, the "cutting out", or scroll work is not as, i guess "clean lined", making it look a little more handmade, but i like it. all in all, i love it and it gets a lot of attention. <end>  buyer beware  While this is a very nice looking ring it is not real sterling silver. I've had it for less than a few days and it's already started to turn my finger green. It is stamped with 925 on the inside, but it surely is not. The inside of the ring is already starting to 'wear' off. Very disappointing because I would have been more than willing to spend a few extra dollars on this to get a REAL STERLING SILVER RING. Buyers if you are looking for real solid sterling silver, don't waste your money here. I'm going to be very reluctant to purchase anything else from this seller.NOTE  you can even see the wear marks on the inside of the ring in their photo they provide! See the black smudges?! <end>  Great Ring!  This is an unusual ring that looks fabulous, and looks even better in person. Given as a gift the other person absolutely loves it and gets many compliments daily! <end>  Sterling silver ring  This is a very attractive ring. I have received numerous compliments and it is a true to size ring. The only problem is that it will bend easily if caught on something, but that is to be expected due to the length of the ring. <end>  NOT Sterling Silver  Watch out, buyers--this ring is NOT sterling silver. It turned my finger green in less than 24 hours. I love the design; it's very unique, but it is not what it has been advertised as. I had to use the clear nail polish method to keep it from turning my finger green. If you want a cool ring that is not actual silver, then this is the ring for you. Otherwise, don't bother. <end>  Sterling silver fork ring  The ring is exactly as pictured. Great item, very pleased the company and the delivery. <end>

A real value for the money & it arrived quickly! <end>  Sterling silver  The ring is beautiful unless the difference betwenn the pictures and the true one. it arrived quickly!its a nice ring but be sure to get the right size! mine was too small. the rim digs into your skin. you might even want a size bigger than you usually get. <end>  pretty  its a nice ring but be sure to get the right size! mine was too small. the rim digs into your skin. you might even want a size bigger than you usually get. <end>
 B000FL50GS  Sterling Silver Scalloped Dome Ring 3/8 wide, sizes 4 - 14 ||	  a great sterling silver ring  I love this ring. It comes in larger sizes. Nicely designed. Good craftsmanship. Described exactly as received. Definitely a keeper. 5-stars!! <end>
 B000FL50MW  Sterling Silver Heart Ring 5/16 inch wide, sizes 4 - 12 ||	  sterling silver heart ring  I must say that the only thing good about buying this ring was the fast service. I ordered it friday and received it the following monday. But it is NOT a true sterling silver ring. This ring left a greenish black mark on my finger. True sterling silver does not do that.And I only had it on for about two hours.I would not recommend this ring. <end>  i love it  It is exactly what i was looking for and the right ring on display! ) i love it i have one complaint though if it is really sterling silver then why is it turning my finger green? <end>
 B000FL50W2  Sterling Silver Double Dolphin Polished Ring 3/8 wide, sizes 6 - 10 ||	  Dolphin ring  A perfect gift for anyone out there who loves dolphins. I have gotten alot of people who will ask me where I got my ring. <end>  sterling silver double dolphin ring  I love my double dolphin ring! The dolphins, however, are hollow, and though comfortable enough while wearing, the thin edges have caught and cut the loose skin of my knuckles when removing the ring. I used extra-fine sandpaper to round the edges under the dolphins, which helped. Still a great ring for such a low price! <end>
 B000FLTJ0G  Sterling Silver Double Oval Earrings ||	  Very Nice  I was pleasantly surprised with how nice these look hanging from my ears. I read the positive reviews and took a chance. The earings are just as Amazon describes them. Another reviewer wrote about the convex curve to the earrings and it does add a nice shine to the earrings. Also the small oval can be moved to the front or to the back of the large oval by threading it through the larger oval. All of the loops and jump rings are soldered closed. Earrings came in a navy velvet pouch inside of a navy box. <end>  Stunning  These earrings look much much better in person!!! Good weight, shining, and not too long, not too short. The two ovals dangle a lot. It's probably the design, but to me, these earrings are inside out when you put them on. I love them more this way since they look different! Feel like a celebrity! <end>  So Pretty  These earings are really lovely. Perfect size, great quality, and not heavy at all. Very shiny too. Great bargain. <end>  Quickly became one of my favorites!  I purchase a LOT of jewelry online, and it's always a hit or miss as you can't really see how they look on you, and I dont have enough imagination for even trying.These earrings are one of the BEST buys I have purchased! And that's saying a LOT cause I place about literally dozens of orders per week.They have a nice weight to them, are very well made, shiny and so unique! The loops actually move in and out as theyre not soldered together, thus making it fluid in motion, and looks great with my long hair.Also, speaking of hair, it doesn't "disappear" in it as most earrings do, but at the same time is not heavy to weigh my lobes down or feel uncomfortable, nor look gaudy looking. It's actually very classy looking.For the price I paid (got them during a gold box special with an extra 60% off), I feel as though I got a real bargain! I would buy them as gifts for the price as it's definitely affordable enough, but I like being unique, so I'll just graciously accept compliments instead. ;DDon't hesitate to buy these! They are just as pictured, and even better in person as you can feel the quality and weight of it. <end>
 B000FLVIB4  Sterling Silver Diamond Accented Children's Heart Locket, 15" ||	  Overall lovely product/packaging disappointing  This review is a bit mixed. While this is a children's silver locket, I ordered it for my mom to wear on her charm bracelet. When it arrived I was pleased with the quality, it was high polished sterling silver with a small diamond accent, as described. However, I wasn't at all pleased with the packaging and the front of the heart was scratched, right next to the diamond. Also the chain was a tangled mess and I can't get the knot out. Basically it comes in a blue jewelry pouch which would look pretty if there were a small box INSIDE the pouch with the necklace mounted on it. Instead they just throw the necklace into the pouch. I am glad I had it shipped to me and not the recipient. I would have been embarassed for her to get it like this. They are sending me a replacement and the shipping was free and only two days transit time. So, if the replacement isn't scratched and tangled, it should be lovely. Incidentally, I reduced some photos to fit the locket and it should be just adorable once its all put together. <end>  Sterling silver diamond accented children's heart locket, 15" review  The chain was very thin and fragile. The locket, itself, stopped closing properly within 3 days. I plan to send it back for a refund. Pretty, but piece of junk. <end>  Good Buy.  Really like the Heart Locket, but the chain will be replaced. It has come apart at the clasp twice so I will upgrade. Very happy overall. <end>
 B000FLX2PY  Sterling Silver Satin Finish Heart Locket, 18" ||	  Not a bad gift  It was a bit difficult getting the picture in, but the locket's appearance is simple yet elegant. I would look for something larger though. <end>  Quality  I was very pleased to see the quality of this locket. It looks much more expensive than it was and adds a classy &#34;bling&#34; without going overboard. Very nice. <end>  Very Nice Product  Very nice and exactly as described. Looks expensive. But beware, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get a picture into the locket portion of this locket. Took almost 2 hours and still doesn't fit exactly. They give you no room to wiggle or help <end>  Perfect for the price  I bought it for a gift and she absolutely loves it.... I looked around at a lot of different stores and this was the best deal for the money. <end>  Great locket.  My daughter wanted to get my wife a locket for christmas. This is a very well made locket that isn't a huge investment. It is not very bulky, which is nice. The chain is a little cheap, but easily replaceable. Overall I am very very pleased with this item, and my wife loved it. <end>  Very pretty but...  the area inside the heart on the front is easily scratched. We gave it to our 7 year old, who loves it, but I noticed it was scratched by the second day she wore it. I love that it has a large space for pictures, but previous reviews are right when they say it's hard to get the pictures into the locket. We did get them in, though. I used Word to crop the picture and put it in a heart shape. Overall, I would recommened it. If given to an adult, it probably wouldn't get scratched as easily. <end>  Gorgeous Locket  My granddaughter wanted a locket for her mom for xmas. I found this one. It is really a nice piece of jewelry. I will get a couple more! Thanks!!! <end>  Beautiful Locket  Obviously, this isn't fine jewelry, but it's a very pretty, high-quality locket that we gave to our 8 y.o. for Christmas. She loves it and it looks very pretty on her. I highly recomend it. <end>  Nice  Good value, well recieved. Used as a Christmas present and had fun asking what pictures would be placed in the locket. <end>  Perfect heart for pictures  This heart is so georgious. My 16 year old grand daughter wanted a locket for her birthday so she could put my picture and her little pups pictures in it, I looked at all the reviews and picked this one out because of all the good comments about how nice this heart was.I agree, it is so nice. not really very big but just right for a 16 year old girl. Now I can't wait to give it to her. <end>  Silver Heart Locket  Beautiful locket. strong chain and clasp. Bought two for my granddaughters who are in their early teens and the locket looks so nice on them. Looks great on an adult too. I did a lot of research on line to find a locket that did not cost to much and had a strong enough chain, this one was one of the best I've seen. Room for two pictures. Pictures go behind two heart shape clear plastic inserts. Remove with point of a pin, keep safe they are easily lost. Scan picture on computer, crop face with heart shape crop tool then resize to fit locket opening. Practice makes perfect. Snap in plastic heart cover over picture. Comes with a beautiful blue velvet box. Made a big hit with everyone. especially the girls. A really great buy. So pretty. <end>  Great Pendant, But...  My wife LOVED it! This pendant was great for my wife and I was even thinking about getting one for my daughter for her birthday. But the clasp broke within 3 weeks and is not usable. I will be getting a little better chain with clasp that will hold a lot better than it did. But don't let this 'clasp' issue prevent you from buying one. The locket itself is really nice. Good product for the price. <end>  Great Locket!  My husband bought this beautiful locket for me. The area for the pictures is large enough to see the details of the picture, but not too large. You can put a picture on both sides. The chain and clasp are strong and a good length 18". My husband cropped the pictures and had them printed at costco. The quality is amazing much better than using our home printer. The pictures could be easily changed, though I will keep the ones he put in it. I highly recommend this great quality, beautiful, silver locket. I love the satin finish! <end>  Great for the price  I bought this for my girlfriend and she likes it. I surprised her with it for valentines day and put a picture of myself in one side and our newly acquired puppy on the other. The only problem she has with it is that it makes her skin itch and break out. But, don't let this scare you she does have very sensitive skin and many allergies. The chain is quited durable and overall we think it is a fine piece. <end>  Silver Heart Locket  My husband got me this locket for Valentines Day. It is exactly as described. There is room enough inside for two pictures. I am very happy with it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in buying a sterling silver heart shaped locket. It is a great value for the money. <end>  Sterling Silver Satin Finish Heart Locket, 18" - Good buy  This was for my Sister in Law from my brother. Delivery was quick and my brother had it long in advance for Christmas.The only problems is that it is a little difficult to open. There is no latch. Design wise for aesthetics is good. For usability not so good.4 stars... <end>  very nice locket for the money  I bought this for my mother and mother-in-law for mother's day. I had the front and back engraved and it looks very nice. The chain is nice as well and not one of those very fine flemsy chains. It's a little hard cutting a picture out to put in the heart but you would have that problem with any heart shape. <end>  Locket  This is a very nice locket, nice sized. About 1/2 in square space for the photos. It's really very pretty. The only trouble is printing pictures that small, but you'll have that trouble with any locket. And there's plastic to cover the pictures which makes a good template. It was a little tricky to get the plastic in and out, but worth it in the end. I recommend using an x-acto knife to cut the pictures out. <end>  very small  if the purpose of this purchase is to put a picture in the locket (as I would assume anyone buying a locket is hoping to do) than you will need the ability to shrink to a very....very small size and really good vision in order to see once the picture is inserted into the locket via microscope and tweezers. in short, the locket is small <end>  gerat for the price  Such a great necklace for the price. MY neice wanted a nice silver locket to put a pic of her baby cousin in since they live in different states and she wants to be able to show pics of her off to firends (lol). But anyway, she LOVED this locket. IT is quality. Is big enough for a 2 cute pics inside, great clasp, shiny, and nice packaging. Great gift. I certinly reccommend. <end>  Good Value  The locket was exactly as promised. I was unable to have it engraved at our local jewelers, because they said being hollow inside, it might &#34;cave in&#34; during the pressure. I was able to find the wonderful world of computer engraving at &#34;Things Remembered&#34; at the mall, so it worked out beautifully.I can hardly wait for my great granddaughter to open it on Christmas morning. <end>  Very nice!  I bought this for my wife just before we got engaged. I glued two miniture photos of us together inside. It was tricky to do but actually very fun and everyone who saw it adores it. My wife wears it almost everyday as a symbol of our love. It is a very nice piece and looks good with all types of dress, she wore it in her bridals and our wedding photos as well. Build quality is nice. Chain is fragile. We are both very happy with it. <end>  Locket  So cute! Only thing I didn't like was that it didn't come with the little clear plastic picture covers that other pockets have come with that you insert over your picture to prevent damage or fading. Otherwise it's perfect!  ) <end>  Beautiful lockets  Beautiful silver lockets - I gave these to my teenage daughter and her friend for Valentine's Day. The best compliment I can give is that they both wear them everyday. Good quality and excellent value for the money. <end>  Happy in the Desert  My son bought for his 17 year old girl friend for their 1st anniversary. He wanted something simple and elegant, without any bling. This heart locket was just right. She loved it. Great price and delivery was quicker than we expected. <end>  don't buy it  It's at the jewelers now getting engraved, but I don't think it's 3/4 inch in diameter and the chain is tacky looking. I would return it if my grand daughter's birthday wasn't so soon. Throwing good money after bad by having it engraved locally for $35.00 and buying another chain from another company. <end>  Girlfriend Loved it - Looks great  I purchased this locket for my girlfriend as a Valentines day present. She loved it!The chain feels and looks very good and the clasp is sturdy. The locket is small but not tiny - my girlfriend is a little over 5 feet tall and the locket was sized PERFECTLY for her. Kind of hard to get a picture in, but once I managed to get one in it looked great.I would highly recommend this locket. <end>  Clasp on locket very poor  People complain about the chain being poor quality, but I have had problems with the clasp for the locket. I even exchanged the first locket I bought (thank you Amazon for your wonderful return and exchange policy!) because the locket would not stay closed. Basically, there is just a flimsy tab of metal (or silver, I guess) that goes into a little hole on the other side of the locket. This system is either faulty or the metal is just poor quality because after opening the locket a couple of times it would not stay shut anymore. The metal tab had moved.As I said, I exchanged it for another one and I've basically had the same problem.The other reviews don't seem to mention this so maybe I've just been unlucky, but it really does seem like the product itself is just poor quality. Well, what do you expect for $40? <end>  Very nice! But...  Delivery was very fast! Overall the locket looks very nice and has a nice design. It is very easily scratched though. I wiped it with a little lens cloth and it made a scratch. Also very disappointed in the inner design. It seems almost impossible to fit a picture on the inside which is really a down side because who needs a locket when you cant even put a picture inside it. It was very hard to get a picture in there. In the end i ended up just leaving it without a picture and giving to my girlfriend for our anniversary empty! This was really disappointing! But still she liked it and wanted to keep it when I insisted that I would return it! It is a very nice piece but you were warned very hard to put in a picture! <end>  silver necklace with heart pendant  I was surprised when we opened the box that the heart was smaller than I expected. Not sure how I will be able to fit 2 images inside of this thing. Kind of wishing they would give directions for inserting pictures. The necklace has a nice finish though overall and should hold up with delicate usage. The chain link is not in my opinion the highest quality. Nice gift for mothers day as it is rather inexpensive but looks like a higher quality item. <end>  Great Quality forthe money  I gave this to my 16 year old daughter, and she loved it! I loved it too. It's made well. The chain is not flemsy. The heart locket is precious in an elegant way. Money well spent. <end>  Great gift!  The look is very beautiful with a smooth finish. It closes firmly with a clic and has a classic look. <end>  Beautiful heart locket  We gave these lockets to our daughters and daughter in law. They all are now enjoying them. They are well made with more than usual space for a picture or two. The chain seems to be sturdy also. I recommend this product. For the price it is a good buy! <end>  Beautiful and perfect  My boyfriend got this locket for me for Christmas and it is perfect. I love it! The detailing on it makes it even better. <end>  simple , nice and good value  Before I purchased this locket, I've looked around the stores, but I couldn't find one that I like in a reasonable price. This locket is very simple, and charming. I bought 2 lockets as gifts to my daughters' best friends in overseas, as we are visiting them. I put each of my daughter's pictures in the each locket, it looks good. I used a sawing needle to lift the tiny plastic cover inside to place pictures in and put it back. It wasn't that difficult even though it is pretty tiny. Since I don't use it, it is hard to say that the quality is good or not, but I have checked many other cheap ones at stores and found that most of the cheap ones I saw had a cover with a hinge that would fall off after a few times of use. This one seems to be as sturdy as the good quality ones ( $50.00 or higher range sterling silver lockets at stores) that I saw at stores. I have opened and closed the cover several times, but it feels sturdy. If my daughter want to get one, I would get the same one for her. <end>  Great!!!  This was perfect!! I bought this for someone special and she loves it!! I liked it so much I even bought one for myself so we could both have a matching locket, it looks great on me too, and I'm a male. If your hesitant about buying this don't be, it's a great quality locket. <end>  Item small but as described  The locket is small but it looks great and is durable. If you really twist it of course it will break, just take care of your things. <end>  Good value  My wife loved it! This locket is a good value for the price, if you're not looking to shell out serious cash. <end>  Pretty good  Its very pretty, as a locket it is small, hard to find photo small enough, simplicity is key here, it makes a very simpleyet effective gift. <end>  Very Nice  Very Nice Quality! Really like the product and definitely worth the money. Seems to be made very well and even comes with a nice chain. <end>  Poor quality  This looks like something you would buy in a .99 store. Cheap looking and weights less then 1 ounce. I returned it immediately. I would never give this to someone as a gift. <end>  Cute locket  This was a Christmas gift for my sister. I'm not sure how she likes it, but I think it's cute though a bit smaller than I imagined. Printing the pictures in the right size and cutting them in heart shape was a pain, but the results were pretty nice. Still, I think that the necklace is a bit expensive at $35 - wait until it's on sale. <end>  Great Locket, Mediocre Chain  This was a gift for my wife and she loves it. It is a sturdy locket with great detail. My only complaint is the chain. It is a bit of a flimsy chain and had begun to tarnish just a few weeks after she started wearing it while the locket maintained it's sheen. I would recommend purchasing the locket, but changing the chain if you can. <end>  very nice locket  this is a very nice locket, large enough to be engraved, a very nice item <end>  Girlfriend loves it  My girlfriend loves this present. She wears it all the time and it looks extremely nice on her. It was an amazing locket. <end>  Great Locket  My girlfriend loved the locket and it took no time at all for it to arrive at my house. <end>  cute but small......  I have this locket its small and I have been every where to get two pics put in and no one will do it I heard you can do it on your own computer but for someone that dont know how is not good for me I can wear it but the purpose was to put the pic in the locket of my grandmother that just passed but I can't so it sits in the box till I can find a way to get the pic's in all and all its very cute about the price its ok I kinda thought it was going to be bigger but no but I did get it during the busy christmas time and no problems getting it on time thanks for letting me share this <end>  REALLY GOOD BUYS FOR MONEYS  I BUY TIEM FOR WIFE IS BIRTHDAY. SHE REALLY LIKE NECKLACE BECAUSE IT LIKE JEWELRY WE HAD IN CHINA. ALSO DO BIG BUY FOR GIRLS. GIRL REALLY LIKE.THANK BIG BUY.P.Q.- ALSO BUY TIEM WITH RING PENDANT. GIRL REALLY LIKE COMBINATION. PUT FACE CROP PICTURE INTO TIEM FOR MAXIMUM HAPPY. <end>  Fine for the price  While attractive, the locket is even smaller than I imagined (requires a photo no larger than 1.3 CM high). <end>  18" locket  The locket was to small so I returned it. It was a well made and very nice just to small. Still locking for a larger one that will hold a 1" picture. <end>  Gumball Jewlery  Clasp broke right out of the box. Don't waste your money on this.She didn't even get a chance to wear it once, seeing as how it broke right when I picked it up. <end>  Cheap and broken...  This locket didn't last two days and my poor daughter - it was the only thing she asked for for Christmas, was heartbroken. The metal was thin and cheap and broke off of the locket. There was no fixing it. Returned it and will never buy jewelry from that I can't hold in my hand again. Sorry Amazon ( <end>  you get what you pay for  Honestly there is nothing special about this pendant. If you're buying a heart locket for a special person, then save up and buy something nicer because this one isn't that great. <end>  Looks nicer than expected...  Yea this locket looks a lot nicer than I expected it to be. I'm soon gonna take some photos to kinkos to shrink them down to size, fit them in the locket and give it to my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. I'm sure shes gonna love it. You should buy this if you're looking for a nice gift for a loved one. <end>  Not the quality I was expecting  ...but you get what you pay for, no?This item came quickly enough, faster than expected to be honest, but I was disappointed when I opened the package as the quality of the locket seemed cheap and a little on the flimsy side. I was looking for a locket with a little more substance to it, a little more weight. This locket definitely is NOT heirloom quality; it would never last long enough to be passed down to anyone.I have been wanting a locket for some time and spent much time pouring over reviews, comparing items and prices and trying to reach a conclusion as to which to buy. I finally settled on this one because of the price...if it wasn't quite what I was looking for (size-wise and quality), then for the price no harm, no foul. I got what I paid for.The locket is on the small side, thin and difficult to open and I'm afraid that too many repeated openings will break it because the metal seems so thin. The etched design on the front is slightly rough to the touch as well, though not enough to be annoying while worn. I only received it this afternoon and have been wearing it ever since, trying to make up my mind whether to keep it or return it. While the locket is large enough to put pictures in, the pictures would end up being so small it really wouldn't be worth the fight to get them set.The only good point of this is the chain, it seems sturdy and I like the fact that it's a rolo chain. However, at 18", it sits way to high on me (the heart sits just below the base of my throat). I should have purchased a longer chain.Like I said, for the price, it's okay, but it definitely isn't what I was looking for. <end>  Lovely Locket  I bought this for my daughter's middle school graduation and she loves it. It appears to be well made and is simple and classy. <end>  Heart Locket  Didn't like it once I got it. Very small, had to glue the picture in. Would have returned but didn't have time (Christmas present). <end>  She loved it!  Bought this for my Mom for Christmas, and put her grandson's picture in it. She loved it! The gift box was very nice. <end>  Perfect!  The locket was a Christmas present for a family member and I was VERY pleased with the quality of it. I had it engraved and it was a complete hit when received on Christmas. I highly recommend. <end>  Beautiful locket!  I bought this as a bridesmaids gift for the girls in my wedding. It looked beautiful on all of them.I actually thought it was so pretty that I bought one for myself as well. The one complaint I had about this locket is that it is hard to open and shut. Once you successfully open and close it several times though it does loosen up a bit. The chain clasp also comes undone fairly easily. All of that being said this is a beautiful locket and I'm very happy with the way it looks. <end>  locket  It got here way faster than expected a little small but its perfect if you buy a longer chain for it <end>  Cute Locket  I bought this for my 7 year old for her birthday. It's just the right size to be able to fit a picture in and the chain is sturdy. She really loves it! <end>  granddaughter loved it  I bought this for my granddaughters 7th birthday. She loved it. My only complaint in the chain is very flimsy. The locket itself is very nice. <end>  My Locket Experience  When I received this item, I was a bit disappointed to see that it had been scratched on the surface. My wife did not mind so I did not send it back. Overall, the locket is pretty nice. My wife loved the way it looked. The only problem she had with it is the plastic insert that is inside to keep the pictures safe. You made need to replace the chain as it does not feel that it is awesome material, however, we have had no issues. Your mileage may vary. <end>  OK but needs improvement  I love the finish on this locket. I do not like the idea of not being able to shrink a picture down to put inside both halves. I bought this for my 5 year old and she loves it but wants pictures inside. I will keep trying, maybe kinko's will be able to do something for me. Just needs to be a little bigger. <end>  Pretty locket  It's hard to find a cute, simple locket decently priced, but this one is definitely it. It's just the right size with just the right details. Simple, but definitely adorable! 4 stars only because the chain it comes with doesn't feel very substantial. <end>  Not the quality I had expected  Quick shipping and item appeared as presented. Unfortunately it broke within 4 weeks of wearing and had to be taken to jeweler for repair. <end>  Lovely gift for the price  I looked both in stores and online for a locket for my granddaughter as a gift for Christmas. She asked for a locket, but as she is 11, I didn't want to spend a great deal on it. (Figuring she might very likely lose it). Anyway, I found this one and ordered it. It is prettier in person than in the picture. It is a perfect size, not to big and not too small. She seemed very pleased with it and Im sure she is going to put a picture of her dog on one side and her cat on the other side.  +) <end>
 B000FLYMI0  Sterling Silver Sculpted Bangle Bracelet ||	  silver bangle braclet  This bracelet is lovely and a great bargin! Shipping was excellent -it was a last minute Christmas gift and arrived in plenty of time. <end>  beautiful  Gave this to my 18 year old daughter to go with her "clubbing" outfit. The unusual shape adds to it's beauty. Im very glad i bought this and wish i had gotten another rather than the mother of pearl and onyx one. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful....  I received this bracelet as a Christmas gift, and it's absolutely beautiful. It's much better quality than I expected. I will definitely be wearing this quite a bit -- this bracelet is a classic. <end>  Love it, love it, love it!  Amazon always ends up having what I want at the right price. This beautiful sterling silver bangle is just another example. I love it! <end>
 B000FLYP0U  14kt Yellow Gold Diamond & Ruby J-Hoop Earrings (.10 cttw, I1, H-I) ||	  Too thin  It is just too thin. U do not realize that - until u get it. If u want something small , this is good. <end>  These made a nice gift  These were very nice and the only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars was because the stones were smaller than the picture made me feel they were. <end>  Diamond and Ruby earrings  Very disappointed in this product. They were so tiny you could barely see them. They are made for small girls, not women. I promptly sent them back. <end>
 B000FM05KS  Natural Green Jade and Marcasite Clip On Sterling Silver Oval Stud Earrings ||	  Very pretty  I bought these for my grandmother who cannot have pierced ears. She loved them. The color is very bright and beautiful. The earring are not too large, and are a great update to any outfit. <end>
 B000FMIH26  Sterling Silver Pink Leaf Murano Glass Cross Pendant ||	  Murano cross  Very pleased with my purchase. It arrived in atimely manner. Pendant was of good quality, in excellant condition. <end>
 B000FMKIFU  Small Twisted Hoops Nickel-Free Sterling Silver Latching Hoop Earrings ||	  Excellent however one thing to consider.  The seller sent them right out and they are the perfect size for upper piercings in ears. The only warning I'd give is the snap bar closure is sharp. The Silver is sharp to the ear. After a day of use I was really feeling a bit sensitive from the sharpness of the bar. I'd say use them in Lower holes usually less sensitive or only if your ears are toughened up. These are nice despite this. For the price excellent. <end>  small but pretty  They were smaller than I pictured in my head but they're very pretty and bright. Overall I'm pleased with them. <end>
 B000FNEL0M  Phiten Classic Titanium Necklace ||	  AMAZIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!1  this product totally is amazin. i highly recommend this product to all athletes. i would give it a 10 out of 10. it is totally worth the low price!!! <end>  Necklace  The only problem I had was that the picture is of the "Sport" necklace, but got the standard style. However, shipping was quick and the item arrived brand new. <end>  Doesn't work  I wore this necklace several times and now realize that I wasted my money. I can't even tell the necklace even has any titanium ... there is no magnetic field. If you want true titanium (no clothe cover)and that does seem to work ... stay way from the 'cloth' covered ones since you can't verify what is underneath unless to disassemble to necklace. I would not recommend this to anyone. <end>  Great necklace  A great necklace, but these are overpriced. I wear it all the time & never take it off. Great color choices! <end>  my grandson loves this  All the little boys are wearing these and I wanted my grandson to have one..ordered this at good price and he was pleased with it..will be ordering him more of different colors! <end>  Just Right  Thanks, this product was just what I was looking for. My daughter really liked it <end>  Looks neat, priced right but useless.  I admit it I knew better. Just because all the multi-millionaires playing baseball wear these certainly doesn't prove they have any medicinal value. However if you want to wear one to look cool this is a pretty good price. For us bigger folks this one comes larger than most. <end>  as promised on time  necklace purchased for a 10 year old. he loves it. and he paid for it, he loved the price. <end>  Phiten Necklace  It is a nice necklace, not sure if it is helping as it was advertised. <end>  pleased, but not sold  I wear the necklace regularly, but mostly for it's looks. I have not really felt the physical effects that the glossy material claims, however, I didn't really expect anything dramatic, and it was not the reason why I bought it. Overall I am pleased, and would recommend it to anyone that isn't looking for it to relieve stress or make their life make more sense! <end>  love it!  Love this! I just wish I would have measured before I bought because it is a bit big! Would highly recommend this to anyone who is active and needs some reflief from the day to day aches and pains. <end>  Back pain is gone  I've got to say that I just love my Phiten neckace. I've suffered from mild scoliosis since I can remember, so sitting for long periods of time always gave me a bit of lower back pain. I haven't had such pain since I started to use this product. I wear it everyday, not only for sports. <end>  It actually works!  I was skeptical at first but after wearing this since Christmas, I've noticed my neck and shoulder area is noticeably looser and I've been getting some colossal cracks in my neck. I work my upper body area in the gym and at home with various chest and shoulder exercises and I've found this helps take some of the post workout stiffness away. Would recommend to a friend. <end>  Good Response  Purchased this for my son. He loves it as it it the fad among his peers. The order arrived quickly from the seller. <end>  Good purchase for teenage son  I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my teenage son. He had asked for one and after comparing several in the price range I wanted to spend, I decided on this. It looks good and he says it works for him. I would recommend this as a trial piece to decide if it works for you before purchasing one that is more expensive. <end>  Can you feel the heat too?  This is another product I bought along with a power balance bracelet in preparation for the honolulu marathon. A coworker of mine swears by this so I decided to try it out for one as soon as you put it on a slight heat surrounds your neck and you can feel something working. In general I feel better when I have it on so if it works for me it might work for you. Good luck <end>  awesome necklace!!!  While watching the baseball playoffs this fall, I couldn't help but notice the necklaces the majority of players were wearing. Looked them up and here it is. Although this specific one wasn't the one I wanted, it works for now. Not only does it make me more powerful and nearly invincible, it also allows me to be pain free!In all seriousness, these necklaces are kind of cool, save for the original nagging from the girlfriend about it looking dumb. They're marketed to help reduce pain in the neck and shoulder area, which is fine if you believe in non-traditional medicine. Since I work in the medical field, I don't buy into this marketing gimmick.Now, if these necklaces combined the amazing therapeutic effects of titanium, copper AND magnets, HOLY CRAP, WATCH OUT.Cool looking necklace, but if you're buying it for anything other than the look, you're not too smart. <end>  Worth the money  My son loves this necklace. He has asked for more Phi-tens for Christmas. Good quality and doesn't fade. <end>  Love this product  I like this product, wearing it for 5 years and I truly believe it functions well. <end>  My kid loves this necklace  He hasn't taken it off since he got it. He is 11 and it is a fad at his school. They have these in one of the sporting goods stores here but they are $30 and up- and I couldn't see paying that much for a necklace for a kid. So we ordered this one instead. It is durable, the colors are nice and bright, and my son seems very happy with it. <end>  Phiten Titanium Necklace  I'v had this necklace for over a month now. I have had constant knee pain for 2 years . This product actually works. My knee pain is almost non existent. I also have a bad back. It has lessened that pain some what, but not totally . I would highly recommend this product. <end>  wish design were sharper  Photo leads one to believe the design is much sharper than it actually turns out to be. <end>  this works  PHITEN AQUA-TITANIUM NECKLACE bought one on a whim and it really works.no more neck pains in the a.m. and it looks pretty cool.just gotta remember to take it off before the shower it doesn't dry too quick!! <end>  Briefing on Phiten Titanium Necklace  Well... actually it looks really cool.. so cool that my friends are asking me to buy some more of this product for them.Regarding the effect on me, I could tell that it really works. I'm a baseball player and I haven't felt any particular pain in my body since I started wearing it!!! <end>  Feeling Great!  I but this just for what was said about it, and I have to admit, because a lot of MLB players use it, I figured, if they use it then it has to work, since I bought it and started wearing it I have not taken it off and my head, shoulders and neck feel great. <end>  Phiten Star Necklace  This necklace was for my two boys that play baseball. They really like the style and they even said it gave them energy. If it helps them in the mental aspect of their game then it the right product. I like the looks and the feel. It is soft and attractive looking. The boys wear it all the time. <end>  Orange  I ordered an Orange Phiten necklace for my kid. He loves these things, and it arrived right on time. The quality is just what was expected. The kid wears it every day. <end>  Super Fast shipping!!! Would order again  Recieved fast free shipping on Phiten necklace. Excellent price! This company provided a great product with no issues. <end>  These are great!  I don't know why I didn't get one of these earlier. I was sure if it would really work, but after trying it there is no way I will ever play a sport without wearing this! <end>  Great  This was a good item for the price...i cant really say that it is a miracle worker but it does feel pretty solid and good. if you end up not liking the way it works than its still a cool necklace to have for the price. <end>  Good  I buy them for my parents. They look good, and my parents like them. Hope they will work as they said. <end>  good necklace  It was very good quality. The clasp is kind of hard to open. Get the smaller size for kids. Size 22 was way too big. It hangs down more than I wanted. <end>  The item is good but...  I ordered two 18" but received a 18" and a 22", obviously I can't wear the 22" one. I'm an international buyer so it's a bit expensive to return this item, however, I donated the 22" one to a local charity sale. Since I can't wear this necklace myself I'm not sure if it works well, so this 3-star rating is given to the seller, for shipping a wrong item. <end>  great  Little neice requested this for CHristmas. She loves it. Little pricey but I guess this is the new trend for the young folks. <end>  Great buy  I purchased this for my husband. I found one in my town for 10.00 more, exact same product so this one is a steal! He liked it and has had no complaints, although the 18" seems to be a bit smaller than that, maybe due to the thickness of the weave around the titanium wire. Good buy. <end>  Phiten Star Shines  I've done a little research on this type of product; the reports show mixed results. The necklace might be a placebo, but it keeps me aware and, therefore, works for me! <end>  What I was hoping for...  I purchased this necklace in hopes that some of my daily aches and pains would lessen; I am still a skeptic by heart, and hoping that all my aforementioned A&P;'s would completely be eradicated by the wearing of this necklace seems,well,silly.It is comfortable to wear (although I do wish I had chose the next size longer for appearance sake.) and not at all heavy.All in all, I would recommend buying this piece to anyone who wants to give it a chance. If I am able to do cartwheels in a few months, I'll report back to let you know. <end>  I wish I could tell if it works  I bought this mostly because I thought it looks cool. I wasn't expecting much to happen otherwise. I wear it when I work out, and it could be improving my stability and strength, but I can't tell whether or not it works.If you are buying this as a miracle cure, I would caution against it, but if you like the look of it then get it. <end>  Phiten Star Necklace  I absolutely love the Phiten Star Necklace. It's comfortable, practical, stylish, and everything listed in the product description. I would recommend this product to everyone. <end>  Pretty but no special effect  This was a present for my sister-in-law, who specifically requested it, hoping that it would somehow give her energy. It hasn't, but she still thinks it's pretty. <end>  Great  I love this it works too. I can feel it getting rid of my cramps and during practice I feel I have more energy and I am able to run harder. It really helps the joints too. <end>  Phiten necklace 22"  It is comfortable and stylish but that is not why I bought it. I have neck problems and was looking for relief from low grade pain that often shows up. It seems to help although it is hard to tell with these things. Nothing scientific but I truly think it reduces and sometimes eliminates the mild pain I have had intermittently for a long time. There may even be a slight energy boost but that is minimal for me. <end>  Really Works!  I have had two back surgeries and am usually in constant pain but once I put this on and kept it on for more than a week it really helped out my lower back pain. Don't get me wrong, this is not a miracle necklace in any way but it did greatly reduce the pain for a while. Once I had to take it off to go back to work (military), I noticed the back pain came back quickly. It made me fill a bit more energetic during the day and is easy to conceal under a t-shirt if you don't want people to ask a lot of questions (I would suggest 22" or larger). Great product...I plan on buying the wrist bracelet next. <end>  For Whatever Reason, My Joints Feel Better  I don't know how this thing works or if it's psychological or just plain coincidence, but my joints feel 100% better since I started wearing this necklace. I had a sore shoulder and sore knees, and since I started wearing this they feel great. If you have joint pain it's well worth plunking down $20 to try one of these necklaces! <end>  Works well, but no miracle  So, my ankle has suffered for about 10 years or so. I have worn a goofy flat shoe that doesn't flex before. I got the necklace and double wrapped around my ankle. It started to feel strange(kinda warm) at first. My first thought was"oh great my brain thinks it is doing something". After a while of not thinking or noticing it, i could walk upstairs without my ankle hurting. I am a sceptic, so i took it off for a few days. My ankle hurt again while walking upstairs. This is NOT a cure. When the weather changes like rain/cold, still hurts a bit. I got the cheapest one possible, but i am going to try the better one. While it does help, do NOT expect a miracle. It can help to reduce pain if double wrapped around wrist or ankle, but not a cure by any stretch. I like the product, but will have to get one of the braided ones to see more. <end>  Good Buy!  Was very pleased to find what my daughter wanted on Amazon again! She got this for a Christmas gift. It was perfect! Thanks Amazon! <end>  Phiten Star Necklace  Necklace is fine and it arrived on time and in good condition. It has helped me somewhat with the stiffness I have had in my neck. I will not say that it has gone completely, but I think it is helping me to get around better. <end>  great necklace---even better price  very happy with this necklace. i bought this for my daughter who wanted one cause they were the latest craze among all her jr high friends. got this one because it was the best price i could find. extremely satisfied. <end>  My 11 year old son loves his Necklace!  Yes this is the latest trend for Baseball Players (young and old)...and my son had to have one! He wanted the Navy one...and absolutely loves it! Great quality...and after over a month of wearing it every day...still looks brand new! <end>  An incredible pain reducer!  I have had this necklace for over a month now, and I have been using it constantly. I am in chronic pain some of witch is in my face and neck. And I have been using very strong magnets to help. But I find this product to be extremely effective at reducing and many times eliminating the pain. It does better than the magnets; and it even helps me sleep better than I have in years.I cannot say enough about this product, because it really works. I just bought the wristbands to help with the pain in my hands and arms. Also one for my wife she finds it helps with her headaches.I learned about this from watching professional baseball, and seeing that most of the players are using it to help with relaxing and their pain. Now I see why they are all using it. <end>  Recommended for computer / internet / game addicts.  If you sit before computer for more than 8 hours a day & you have lack of excercise then this product is for you.This tech is invented in Japan & this product is made in Japan, So you can trust its quality. <end>  Very Pleased.  I bought this item, because I always see Boston Red Sox players wear them and thought they looked cool. It is cool, and it does relieve some minor aches and pains that I have/had. I recommend getting one for yourself, if you want to be cool like me. <end>  GIVES ME POWER  THIS NECKLACE GIVES ME POWER!!! No seriously it's just a blue necklace that I only bought because Josh Beckett wears them. GO SOX! <end>  Necklace  I bought this as a gift for a niece. She told me that she liked it a lot and so did her friends. <end>  It looks cool!  Aside from the "coolness" factor for my teenage baseball player son, I'm not sure what else there is to say about the article. He is certainly thrilled with it. His tournament team were all wearing them at Sunday's tournament and they won the championship! <end>  necklace  Was pleased with the timely receipt of the necklace and it came in excellent shape. <end>  cool necklace, doesn't work though  You probably saw some baseball players wearing this necklace and are curious. Does it work as advertised? Nah. It looks cool and I enjoy wearing it, but it does nothing for pain or tension or stiffness, etc. I know it's very popular in baseball (I myself work for MLB) but at the same time, baseball players are very superstitious, and considering these come in various colors and can be braided, it's not surprising to see them everywhere. I do like mine a lot, though. I'd recommend tossing it in with your clothes to be washed once in a while, especially if you workout or sweat, or even if you shower with it on -- it really does need to be cleaned thoroughly to remove that built-up sweaty smell. Cheaper here on Amazon than in sporting good stores. <end>  not what I expected  I have the wrist phiten and it works great. I expected tension relieve in my neck but got more from wearing this neck one. They might be fakes. Buyer beware and check things out. <end>  Sorry, little improvement here.  I wore this for approximately 2 months, and hardly noticed any change. Maybe, I need to wear it longer, but I have noticed almost no improvement with my back pain. <end>  Great product  Great product at an awsome price. Cannot buy them local for that. Kids love them. <end>  this is a great product  this is a GREAT product. i am on my feet 8 to 12 hours a day. im a chef, before i used this my lower and upper back and shoulders killed me. now i dont even feel them. when i take the necklace off when go to bed i dont sleep wiht stuff around my neck. my back starts screaming. i have had one before and gave it to my boss because he had wicked bad back. i also play golf and i dropped 3 shots because i had more flexiblity and my back wasnt hurting at all when i finished all 36 holes. <end>  good  I don't know if it really works or not but recently my husband had to help my neighbor's moving and he 'felt' he recovered faster after that and 'feels' good every morning with it. Feels good = endolphine, right?I should've gotten one size smaller though. If you are not that huge muscle built around your neck 16" for a guy whould've been just fine. <end>  I'm a believer  I'm an active 49 year old female who was having chronic hip and knee pain, especially when sleeping. Last month Amazon had great special on the PHITEN stuff so I gave it a try. I'm a believer. No more hip and knee pain. I wear the necklace 24/7 except in shower and have purchased the titanium discs and stick them on any spots that feel sore after a strenuous day. The products are amazing. What have you got to lose with Amazon's excellent return policy. <end>  NOT FOR ME  I have used one of these for a month, and I have observed myself, my general wellbeing, and my backpain with and without the necklace, while sleeping, while doing sport, while at the office... and I have not noticed any difference at all. For this, and because, in my research, I have not been able to find a even a single scientifically justified reason for these to work, I am giving it one star. I only hope that others read this review and think twice before spending their money. <end>  Customer Service Sucks  I have also seen many people wear these. I workout a lot. I decided to order two braclets and measured my wrist at 7 1/8 and order 7 1/2. I could not close the clasp. I sent them back only to have them returned!!! They told me it was custom- I order one black and one orange- how is that custom. I talked to two CS reps with the same answer- non-refundable!! They could have saved one customer by giving the correct size and sending back, instead they go to the expense of writing a letter and postage to send back the braclets.I have many people ask me about these in the gym- I can now tell them- DO NOT BUY, THE CS SUCKS. I guess I will find some kid in Middle School with skinny wrist and give it to them. I'm blown away. <end>  Read the package make-source  I personally used the tape and the e-water lotion together and the combination effectively subdue my neck-shoulder ache which I have for many years. I applied the lotion daily after bath at night and replace the tape every 2-3 days. I am convinced with the technology that I decided to try their jewellery products since having the tape seen on body is not a pretty sight to public eye. Before I make any haste/impulse purchase, I googled for the product reviews and realised it is a mixed reviews - ~50 50 positive and negative. As I am convinced with what I have experienced with the tape and lotion effect, so I decided to trust my gut feeling to get the bracelet. I take it as the 50% negative reviews could be because the users do not have any pain/aches to begin with so they do not experience any "miracle". For example, if you have a flawless skin to begin with, you will not expect any miracle effect even if you apply La-mer/SKII/Lancome/Estee Lauder expensive skincare product daily. That's the logic. I seriously ALMOST buy this product until I turned over the package and saw this  Made in PXXXXXXXXXS (not Japan!). Instantaneously, I put back the item on the shelf and re-purchased the tape and lotion (both are made in Japan) instead. Now I know why the split review on the bracelets because the manufacturing source is different - this is my gut feel by the way. I rather tape around my body inconspiciously to mimick the jewellery claimed effect than buying the actual jewellery where the quality is questionable by my gut-feeling and so not comfortable in buying at all. <end>  Very Good Necklace  it has deffenitly worked for me. i have loved it and i would recomend it. altho i bought it a little big it still has worked just fine. <end>  Satisfied customer  The product was exactly as we expected and was shipped in a timely manner. No complaints. <end>  Ummmmm...  I am not sure what I was expecting from this product...but pain relief from the short amount of time I've worn it has been unnoticed. <end>  Nice necklace  Exactly what i expected and saw online and in the store. No healing abilities but it was no surprise. I like it and i think it is ok for its price. <end>  Helps me sleep better  I wear it mostly at night, or if I will be very active (skiing, etc.). Seems to work for me! <end>  Great gift for a hard to please baseball fan  I know it's only a necklace but my husband is so hard to buy gifts for and he's a major Red Sox fan, so this was a great gift. I guess many baseball players wear these(the superstitious ones) to enhance their game. The necklace is suppose to have titanium in it, thus producing "majical powers". What ever the case my husband was surprised I noticed the players wearing them and has worn his every day since recieving it. Now that I think of it, he has improved in certain areas  ). In summary, this is a great inexpensive gift. <end>  phiten titanium star neckless  the neckless is ok but the company i bought it from are very rude would never buy an ite fro the again.EVER <end>  Nice product  Purchased this as gift for my daughter. It looks great and she loves it. I can't say much more about it. <end>  Mhmm, like it.  I had bought this for my fiance for a gift and he still wears it. He loves it. I would buy him another if he wanted one. <end>  To big and it was faded  The necklace was way to big and it was not the hot pink that was shown in the picture it had a more faded look. <end>  Good buy on a Phiten  This was the best buy I could find on a Phiten as Christmas time. I believe I paid around $7 plus about $5 shipping. Shipping is a bit high for such a lighrweight item but the necklace itself seems durable and my 13 son wears it every day. <end>  Not exactly as it appears  We have several Phitens - all of which are in the blue or black family. My daughter wanted an orange one, since her team colors are orange and white. In the photo, this looks like it is truly orange - and bright! The reality is that it's not. It's a very dingy color, nearly brownish, and it almost looks as though it's gone through mud and then someone attempted to wash it. Suffice it to say, I bought it for her for xmas, and she hasn't worn it yet. I'm thinking it will stay on her bureau. It's too bad. <end>  Glad to have a new one...but....  The necklace was 16&#34; not 18&#34; but it fit (barely) so I kept it. I had an old one that I lost a while ago and once again I feel better when working out and seem to feel better between workouts....I just wish it was a bit longer. <end>  Perfect!  This neckalce came quickly and in it's original packaging, just as I was looking for. My daughter loves it! Thanks! <end>  magnetic necklace  The necklace is unattractive and doesnt lay right on your neck. It's made of rope and magnets and the rope is too thick and twisted. I returned it asap.Phiten Star Necklace, Black, 22" <end>  Nice Necklace  Nice necklace, looks great and fits very nice; it has a very good quality.I dont know if this helps at all with pain but it's still a great product.Very fast delivery.Highly recommended. <end>  Present for brother  This is what my brother wanted for Christmas. He was very exctied to receive it! <end>  Doesn't work, but it looks good  In my opinion, this product doesn't work as advertised, but it looks good, so I really can't complain. I bought mine knowing that it most likely wasn't going to work, but I figured that if it did, it would be nice. It is simple looking, and can be tucked under any shirt. I wear mine everyday, and I have noticed no change. I would recommend this for someone who wants to try something new. <end>  stupid  this is a piece of crap i ordered my about 2 weeks ago and the only good thing about it was that it came about 2 days early which was good but the necklace broke the second day i got it. <end>  Great experience  Ordered this necklace for my son. He loves it! Got it just a few days after ordering it! Great experience! <end>  Looks good. Works like a pile of poo.  Yeah, so I was suckered into buying this product after seeing Josh "LIAR" Beckett wearing this during one of his pitching outings. Lemme just say THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP!!! No way does this thing relieve anything. I think its all in your head because when I first bought it I too believed it was working. But now MY BACK HURTS!!!! LIARS!!!! ARGH!!!PS Josh Beckett is currently injured...On the other hand, it does look nifty so if youre just buying it for the look then go for it. If not, go to an asian massage parlor or something. <end>  It works if you think it does!  Come on, people! If these products really worked, everyone would wear them! The manufacturers want you to think they work, so they can sell them and make $$$. I have tried the phiten, and the balance bracelet, and magnetic therapy. I have noticed no change in my myriad aches, pains, and stiffnesses. I have worn a phiten necklace for over a month, just to give it a chance. If anything, I feel worse with it on, so I am giving up. Save your money! <end>  Nonsense  This bracelet doesn't contain any "ions", "technology" nor "energy" which would noticeably affect the human body at all.Magic bracelets with different metals and magnets in them have been LONG PROVEN USELESS. Do you know who first debunked these things? *BENJAMIN* *FRANKLIN* did, two hundred years ago!He found out that it didn't matter whether he put metals or magnets or pieces of painted wood in them, people couldn't tell the difference. He told people they would increase strength, eliminate pain and cure all sorts of diseases with mysterious "energies". Of course it was nonsense but most people who bought them nevertheless claimed that they "worked".It's just a bracelet. No ions. No technology. No energy. No magic.Buy this bracelet only if you want to show the world that you don't have a clue. <end>  Who needs medicine?!?!  I bought this because I was very sick with no hope in sight, until someone recommended the Phiten Star Necklace. I put it on and instantly felt better. No more treatments for me! I threw all my meds out the window and got a ticket for littering but I no longer needed them is what I am trying to say.Not only that I was running faster, jumping higher, and could levitate. I have never had these abilities before but thanks to the Phiten Star Necklace I was like a super-human. Nevermind that this is just another new-age trend with tweens, and these do as much as you holding a marble in the fly of your underwear. These did so much it was amazing, and I promise it isn't just all in my head or your heads collectively. My friend saw what happened with me and wanted to one-up me, like always. So he read these have titanium in them and so he knew his Nike driver was made out of titanium too, so then he took it out of his golf bag and cut it off the shaft and wore it around his neck too. It was too much titanium and they don't expect him to make it through the end of the year.If you want to feel better and you KNOW it won't all be in your head, then you have to get this Phiten Star Necklace, it works (non)miracles! <end>  Broke within a few weeks  My necklace broke within a few weeks of purchase. (The bracelet I bought with it was too small. I wore it anyways, and it fell off within days and I lost it.) <end>  Sizing of the 18 inch variation  It is 45 CM (17.7 inches), counting the clasp. Actual length when around your neck hovers at 17 inches.If that helps you with determining what size is for you, then I am glad to be of some help.Made out of comfortable material and I see no structural weaknesses.I didn't buy it for whatever hocus pocus it is trying to sell itself on, I just liked the style. <end>  This didn't make any difference  I thought this product was going to make a visible and evident difference in my performance (I play tennis). It did nothing for me. <end>  Great Buy!  Just as advertised and still in the original package half the price of the local sport shop! Shipped quickly! What a bargain! <end>  Fits just right  Unless you are a little guy I recommend the 22'' version of this. It isn't a choker and as far as it working... I really can't say. <end>  junk  After 2 days it broke. I contacted phiten and they told me since I didn't buy it from them I'm screwed. I was able to fix and improve it I like it. Just poor craftmanship <end>  Works fine  The product seems to be fine... I do notice a slight decrease in soreness while wearing this product. The only complaint I have as of right now is that the necklace is a bit stiff and wont lie flat around my neck. Tends to try and keep its oval shape. This may wear off in time. Great delivery time also. <end>  Very nice  I ordered this over night so it came fast. I love it. It fits perfect, seems to be good quality. I hope it helps with my aches, if not at least it looks good. <end>  In good condition, as promised...  The necklace was received in good condition, and appeared to be new. I gave it to my friend as a gift, and she was terribly excited. <end>  phiten titanium necklace  very happy with product and seller, item arrived when promised and in excellent condition...been wearing necklace for over a week now and seem to help.all in all, i would recommend this product and seller <end>  Worked out nicely for a gift.  My son gave it as a requested present. It worked out great. We have already gone back and purchased another for my youngest son as well, just a different color. <end>  I can't believe it but it really seems to work!  I bought this titanium necklace just to try one more alternative treatment for my joint pains and was really pleasantly surprised. It seems to be actually helping. I take tons of supplements and use magnets as well as the Q-ray ring/bracelet but this is the first item that seemed to immediately help decrease the pain in my joints. I'll have to see how it fairs as time goes by but if constantly wearing a rather ugly necklace is the price to pay, so be it. I can't say it'll help everyone who tries it but it definitely seems to be relieving my joint pains. Yehhhhh.....something that REALLY works!! <end>  These are great!  I had back pain for about a year. After seeing these necklaces being worn by a ton of Major League Baseball players I decided to give one of these a try. Next thing I knew, my back pain was gone. Coincidence? Maybe. But, when I forget to put it back on after a shower I sometimes feel pain again. These are very light weight and comfortable. Highly recommended. <end>  Fewer Aches and Pains  I am a chronic sufferer of back and neck pain. An accident several years ago left me with a fractured vertebrae and more pain than I know how to deal with. I watch a lot of baseball on TV and saw a lot of players wearing this and decided to give it a try. This product(along with a weekly workout regimen) has helped me deal with and exceed my own standards of pain tolerance. I don't know whether it's a mind-over-matter type of experience, but at this point, I don't really care. If you deal with aches and pains similar to these, I would definitely give this a try. <end>  it really works !!!  I've had gout for over 12 years and I constantly get flare ups on my right ankle. At times when my flare up was not as severe, i often would have minor ankle swells lasting all day. With a number of supplements taken such as black cherry fruit extract pills, glucosamine, NSAID's, and even acupuncture, i constanly had a slight swollen ankle that bothered me each day, especially in the evenings. Since watching the baseball players use it, I began reviewing the benefits of using this bracelet and heard from the BB players that it was helping them ease pain. I immediately thought of buying one for my dad since he always complained about his neck and how much it bothered him. Mind you that he is a welder who constantly shifts his welding hood downward with the use of his neck..figured that was the main reason why his neck hurt all the time. I bought this necklace and gave it to him and told him that the bracelet should help reduce is neck pain. Very kindly, my father acknowledged my statement as he placed it on his neck. Surprisingly, my dad called me two days later and said..."son, i couldn't wait to call you to tell you that the my neck pain is gone!!, and you are right! this thing helped my neck pain!" I was very glad to hear that...now here is my story. I got in Amazon and purchased one for me with the crazy idea of placing it on my ankle where my swelling occurs. My ankle measured 11 inches in diamater so i purchased the 22 inch phiten black bracelet. The day of arrival I opened the package and tied it on my ankle..perfect fit once double looped. Folks or readers..my swelling has gown down and my ankle pain went away!!!! Really...I can't believe that this bracelet served its purpose. Unbelievable! Now i can get up in the morning and not feel any pain in my foot. My evenings are much better than they every have been. i feel more energized throughout the day and feel great at night.I still take my cherry fruit extract pills, B complex, and Glucosomine supplements to help eliminate my uric acid in my body. i also take a teaspoon of baking soda to help neutralize the acid in the blood(kidney specialist referral).for those of you who have any joint pain, i suggest you try this bracelet and place it on the trouble areas. Of course it's impossible to find one long enough to fit around your waist, for those who have waist problems, but having one on your ankle, neck, and wrist will certainly help balance those energies overall.this is my story and felt it is worth sharingto those who are thinking whether or not this product works. I would gladly here anyone's testimonials about this bracelet. It truly works !!! <end>  Daily Relief  We wear these necklaces daily to aid with the wear & tear of daily work -- They help tremendously to ease any soreness and/or pain -- Highly recommend this product!!! <end>  It Works!  This Product really works, it helped relieve pain i have had for months and this is the only thing that has kept the pain away. Awesome product, i totally recommend this product to anyone with pain that doesnt go away with meds. <end>  Works for my shoulder  I've been wearing it for 3 weeks now. I have sciatic due to a herniated disc. I was hoping this will relieve pain. I guess it's not that powerful to wear it on the neck to get rid of the pain in my low back. I also got the bracelet which really works for my wrist, elbo and shoulder. Well, it's probably the combination of the necklace and bracelet that make them feel pretty much pain free. They are painful because I am a Programmer and work on the computer all day.I would say this product works. I may be buying the waist belt that is not sold here. <end>  Great product.  Got this for my husband, and he just loves it! Wears it every day. Helps prevent him from getting his headaches... <end>  Alternative Pain Relief  Both my husband and I use these to relieve our neck & shoulders of the pain from herniated discs. We wear them daily, and they do take the edge off. We have been using them for over two years now. <end>  Helps with pain from drumming  I'm a drummer who does a lot of session work and driving around to gigs who deals with chronic back and neck pain. I've been through chiro treatment and use all sorts of inversion tables, back rests, and braces to help deal with the pain of muscle stress and tension in my back and neck. Sometimes this pain spreads to my ribs and other areas so my pain simply comes from tense muscles, no disc compressions or anything like that. After buying this at a local sport shop and putting it on, I got into my car and slouched down into my seat (something I don't usually do because of the pain in my lower back) and drove to where I needed to be, not even realizing that my pain had went away. After wearing this necklace for a few days, I have stopped taking muscles relaxers at night, and I noticed while waking up I don't feel any tension. Usually waking up in the morning I feel the most tension but haven't had a problem for the past week. This morning while getting ready for work I was having some pain in my left ankle, and it was popping. I never have ankle pain and it never pops (must have tweaked it). Therefore, I took my necklace off and wrapped it around my ankle. 5 minutes later the pain was gone. I'm not sure how this product works, although I'm a firm believer in the bodies natural healing process. If this IS indeed placebo effect working, then what is the big issue? People should understand that placebo effect is a natural and very important process that can occur in our body. Western medicine spends time trying to get medication to work apart from the placebo effect, which is dangerous and a waste of time. I feel this product really does work and suggest it to anyone who wants to help themselves overcome pain with their body's natural healing process. Stop listening to other people's criticism and see if this product works for you. Your mind plays a bigger role in the success of this product than you think. That is all.... <end>  Nice necklace.  I don't know who the hell thinks this works, but it doesn't. Nice necklace though. I haven't stopped wearing it just because I don't have any other necklace to wear. <end>  Perfect Gift for 12 y/o Grandson  Our grandson wanted a Phiten necklace for his 12th birthday ... this was a last-minute purchase but it arrived even quicker than expected so it was here in time for his birthday. Sometimes it is hard to impress a tween ... this gift was warmly received and is worn every day. Now a younger grandchild is putting this item on her Christmas wish list. <end>  Not happy... Whatsoever.  Very, very, very dissatisfied with this order... NOT the correct size. NOT the item pictured. Not the item titled. Says 18", but it came as 22". I have a small neck... However, it shipped/arrived extremely quickly. ONLY good thing about ordering this item. I could have gotten pretty much the SAME EXACT item for $4.99 from another seller on Amazon. Stole $10 from me. <end>  Atleast it looks cool!  Well, I got what I ordered. Does it work for me? No. Besides wearing it as a fashion item this necklace serves no other purpose. If you are having pains in your body try stretching or heading to the gym. I promise that will work better than some gimmick. <end>  It works!  I thought that was bunk and I laughed when my husband bought, especially since I'm the one that has had chronic back and neck pain for the last 3 years - 2 of the years of consistent chiropractic work at least 3 times a week. We recently moved and things improved drastically with only the occasional neck pain, I'm assuming from less stress, then this morning I woke up with a killer headache and could barely move my head from the stiffness and pain in my neck. I took my husbands necklace and laid in bed, after dozing off for an hour I woke up and things were 90% better. I then cracked my neck and we were at 98% I took the necklace off long enough to take a shower and by the time I got out my neck was locking up again so I put it on for the remainder of the day until my husband got home. I'm ordering mine asap, it was enough to convince me - although I *hate* the look, clashes with all my clothing except my running stuff. Based on another persons review, I am eager to try it on my ankle, I too have a bad ankle from a severe sprain a few years ago - I bet this will help for sure! This product rocks. <end>  Pseudoscience voodoo. Check wikipedia  I can't believe there are so many gullible people out there. These necklaces don't actually do anything. Look up phiten and pseudoscience.Like David Hannum said, "There's a sucker born every minute." <end>  Trendy Necklace  I'm not sure if I bought this for my 13 year old son or 19 year old nephew. However, it doesn't matter because both of them love their necklaces. <end>  A Gimmick  Bought the 22 inch Navy Blue one. Should have bought a longer one as it can still be seen when I wear formal shirts at work.More importantly, I dont see any benefits with wearing this.I will give it a couple of more weeks and if I still see no benefits, I will write it off as one of my many frivolous purchases. <end>  Great  I bought it for my boyfriend and sent it as a gift.He loved it, and still wears it to this day.It's comfortable and fits with the outfits he wears.=) <end>  Outstanding  I bought these for my grandchildren. All the kids at their school has one or would like to get one. They are very nice and I would recommend this to all your children or grandchildren. My grandchildren only takes there's off to take a bath. They were at a Christmas get together and the kids there wanted to know how they could get one and my daughter-in-law called to find out so they could order some for their children.I think Amazon is great as I only have to wait a couple of days and I have my product I ordered, plus Amazon products you do not have shipping charges.Kay J., North Carolina <end>

 B000FNQ0AQ  3/8 ct Round Diamond Double Prong-Set Solitaire Engagement Ring 14k White Gold (H-I Color, SI2 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  An Elegant and Beautiful Ring  I was hestitant to order a diamond ring via the internet. Now, I am so glad I did. This ring is beautiful. The diamond sparkles and flashes with color. Given the combination of color rating, clarity, quality of cut of the diamond, and the aesthetics of the 14k white gold setting, this ring is a bargain. It a great example of classic elegance. <end>  EXCELLENT DIAMOND RING VERY IMPRESSIVE  I bought this engagement ring for my girlfriend, afraid in how it will look on the real world and this is an excellent buy. Guys if you want to score the big points with your special lady, do not hesitate to purchase this ring, is elegant, discrete and looks amazing. <end>
 B000FNUH1E  Simmons Jewelry Co. Men's Bracelet, 8.5" ||	  Sparkling  This is an awesome gift for a male. It's shines very nicely. It looks more expensive than it really is. People come up to my husband all the time asking him where he got his bracelet. <end>
 B000FO8V5M  Men's Diamond Accented Cross Pendant in Stainless Steel ||	  butch  This a very nice cross and would recomend it. In the description it never gave it's length (1.5 in.) but just right. Price was average, but worth it. <end>  son's pick  My son picked this cross out after months of looking and he loves it! Thanks for the speedy service! <end>  I didn't get what I paid for  I'm extremely disapointed because it seemed from other reviews that the product was good. When I ordered it, I paid for a stainless steel cross pendent, on a chain, with a DIAMOND accent. WHat I got was a stainless steel pendent on a chain with the letters STEL imprinted on the front where the diamond should be. To make matters worse, this was a christmas present for someone who lives quite a distance away from me. now he has to send it back to me so that I can return it. I am so unhappy with this <end>
 B000FOCCXO  Kansas City Chiefs Ring Size 8 ||	  Excellent quality!  I received the product when they stated I would receive it. There wasn't a question as to when or how much. It was very simple. Excellent service and product! A+ <end>
 B000FONFYO  Southwestern Style Animal Track ( Raccoon, Moose, Mountain Lion, Coyote, Beaver, Gray Wolf and Bear ) Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 10 1/2, #11873 ||	  beautiful  This ring is just exactly as it's pictured, and simply gorgeous -- and Taos Trading's customer service  fantastic.

 B000FOZ8VW  .925 Silver Circle & Square Link Bracelet ||	  The photo of the bracelet was accurate,.  The photo of the bracelet was accurate. I did return it, because I didn't like the way it fit my wrist, but that was my problem, not any problem with the actual bracelet. <end>

 B000FPCDQY  Mom and Heart Designed Mystic Sky Topaz and Diamond Accents 10K White Gold Ring Size 7 ||	  Lovely for a Little While  My husband gave this to me for Mother's Day when I was pregnant with our first child. It was such a lovely ring and wonderful gift. I have worn it every day all day for nearly 2 years and it still looks great! The picture definitely does not do the stone justice; it's a really pretty shimmery color that picks up and reflects purple, blue, pink and a hint of yellow. The MOM engraving is tasteful versus tacky. The 2 little diamonds on either side of the topaz are trivial and not really a focal point of the ring. *UPDATE* The main stone fell out when it was about 2.5 years old. Guess it's back to the drawing board P <end>
 B000FPHGYI  White Ceramic Pendant Necklace with Floral design ||	  Price = quality  The pendant painted not perfect, but looks good enough for this money. <end>  Pretty pendant  The item was exactly as described & as pictured. I received it well within the estimated delivery period. It's very beautiful & has a nice weight to it, but I am going to re-string it since the yellowed wooden pendant does not match the bright white bead chain (which looks great by itself, too!). <end>
 B000FPKOX8  Stainless Steel Unisex Medium Band, 6 ||	  Looks great doesn't tarnish  Great product for the price, has a nice heavy feel, doesn't tarnish, really like it. <end>

 B000FPWU2G  Cute Stretchy Poppy Jasper Chip Bracelet ||	  yes yes, very good  This is a good quality bracelet the is both fun too look at and also has some anti fatigue properties. i reccomend these stonw chip bracelet sets highly <end>  They Make Great Gifts  These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit. Since they were so inexpensive, I was able to give everyone a gift. <end>  Nice Poppy Jasper Chip Bracelet  It is only $1.99 plus whatever fraction of the shipping charge belongs to it. I ended up giving it to a friend for Christmas and ordering another for myself. <end>
 B000FPWU3K  Cute Stretchy Tourmaline Chip Bracelet ||	  They Need to Take a Better Picture  The tourmaline bracelet I received was so much more attractive than this picture. Greens, pinks, reds, a few clear, a few blackish, and some mixed green/pink chips. A good deal for a tourmaline chip bracelet. <end>
 B000FPYXPI  Cute Stretchy Black Agate Chip Bracelet ||	  Very Small  The bracelet I received had very small chips. It would be ok for a child or someone who wanted a small bracelet, but if you want something bigger, this is not for you. It looked small even on my six inch wrist. I returned it. Maybe I'm expecting too much for $1.99. <end>  I love one and like the other  I ordered two of these ath the same time. I love the one that's made with round plumpish chips and I like the one that made of small flat chips. So hey, I'll give the one made of flat chips as a Christmas gift. <end>
 B000FQ0Q5I  Cute Stretchy Peridot Diamond Shape Bracelet ||	  Beautiful Bracelet, Beautiful Price  The Peridot Diamond Shaped Bracelet by "Cute Stretchy Gems" is a good example of the translucent variety of the gemstone. Though not of faceted gemstone quality it is a very consistant light mint green color. It reminds one of Jade, a little, but more translucent. It will fit a 7" wrist comfortably. <end>
 B000FS5FJS  Sterling Silver Prayer Box with Tulips ||	  I love this Prayer Box with Tulips!  I have been looking for necklaces like these for a long time, and I had come across this amazing necklace on Amazon.I get compliments daily from people on my necklace; everyone wants to know where I got it from, and I tell them where I got it from, and they say that they're going to look it up and purchase one. That makes me happy to know that not only do I enjoy this lovely piece of jewelry but that others do to!Thank you for selling such a wonderful product that looks beautiful and is durable, and it's just amazing!I will definitely do business again with this retailer, and I will definitely be recommending this place to others!A+! Keep making great and wonderful jewelry as you are, and you will be a huge success!Once again thank you so much! <end>  beautiful item  now this is a fantastic item really beautifuly crafted something that will make people stop and ask hey where did you get that? you can put a small mantra or charm in this necklace to give you a sense of well being since you can open it up like a locket. this item makes a lovely conversation piece. <end>
 B000FSCTBK  Sterling Silver Christian Fish shaped Prayer Box ||	  unique & very pretty  Unique prayer box design, nice pleasant weight to it, nice size. Chain is thin. Overall an inexpensive but unique & good quality piece to own or give, if you're looking for a prayer box pendant. <end>
 B000FSHITI  1.00 Carat Antiqued Sterling Silver & Diamond Bracelet - 7.2" ||	  Good value at $70  Don't pay retail for this. But at $70 the value is there. The bracelet looks nice. The diamonds are a good size, white, and sparkly but are heavily included. <end>  Great!  I just recieved it, and it looks even better than it does on the picture! Yeah, brilliants are kind of cloudy, but it doesn't make it worse. It perfectly fits my wrist, and looks beautiful. I would recommend this item for every one! <end>  not what expected  I received this bracelet yesterday and it is nothing like the picture. The diamonds and VERY cloudy...not sparkly. I am sending it back for a different one. If you don't mind the cloudy diamonds, this is your bracelet. <end>
 B000FSN0BS  14K White Gold 6x4 Teardrop Garnet Pendant ||	  Very small  The photo in the ad is very misleading as to the size of the pendant and I found no where in the ad as to the size of the stone so I presumed that the size would be similar to what was pictured. The pendant is very small. The quality of the piece is otherwise good just very disappointed in the size. <end>  Disappointed  Although the pendant looked nice, it was much smaller than I thought it would be and came on a plastic chain...so I'm disappointed <end>
 B000FSN19O  Sterling Silver Hearts & Kisses Charm Bracelet - 7.5" ||	  Don't Waste Your Money  This is such low quality, I would never have bought this had I seen it. At the "discount" price it is wildly overpriced for what it is. It has all the fine workmanship of something that comes out of a gumball machine, really, I'm not kidding.The little charms are hollow (that's understandable) and they have holes in the seams where the front half is attached to the back (that's cheap). The seams are very crudely done. Plus there are rough little nodes along all the edges. It feels like spray-painted plastic, and I think it might just be. There are places where there are dark black specks, and it's not tarnish; looks like the spray paint didn't stick.Believe me, this is going back. <end>
 B000FSN19Y  Sterling Silver Shiny Fluted "X-Bars" Stampato Bracelet ||	  Awesome buy for the price!  Bracelent exceeded my expectations. X-bars are solid underneath and links are joined same as fine jewelry costing $$ more. <end>
 B000FSN1GM  Sterling Silver Roman Numerals Textured Hoop Earrings ||	  Great Design  I am not much into silver jewelries but this pair of sterling silver earrings are beautifully designed. They are light on the ears, unique, and casual but elegant. I am so thrilled to have purchased this pair of earrings. <end>
 B000FSQU2O  Ayala Bar Pin - Classic Collection in Blues, Oranges, and Earthtones #2595 AP OP ||	  Ayala Bar Brooch  This is a beautiful interesting, unique brooch which will go with so many earthtones that I wear. Shipping was also prompt!!! <end>
 B000FTR3MO  Sterling Silver Inspiration "Love", "Happiness", & "Peace" Bar Jewelry Necklace ||	  Great Message  I ordered this because I love the message of the jewelry. I think it is a unique design and the charms are well made. The chain is a little cheap, but the price warrants that and I will probably just get a new chain. No big deal. <end>
 B000FU8A4I  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Filigree Basket Hoop Earrings ||	  Poor Quality  The first time I tried to put these on, the prong broke. How do I return them for being defective? <end>
 B000FU8AB6  Sterling Silver Synthetic Amethyst Purple CZ Eternity Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  One of the stones fell out and I've only had it for a week  I loved this ring. I bought and received another one as well as earrings from this vendor at the same time. Much to my surprise and disappointment, one of the stones fell out today. I don't want to go to the trouble to return it so I glued it back ... I hope I don't lose anymore stones.  -( <end>
 B000FV3GMI  Clearly Charming September Sapphire Color Paw Print Birthstone Cat Dog Bear Animal Theme Italian Charm ||	  for our daughrter  My daughter still has her small doggy Baby girl this is also her birth stone. so it was fitting to get it in a shape of a paw and in her birth stone <end>
 B000FV69HM  Onyx and quartz dangle earrings, 'Excellence' ||	  More beautiful than the picture  These earrings are magnificent  truly elegant yet also casual enough to wear anywhere. The smoky quartz shines and sparkles around the onyx in a well made design. A beautiful box is included, and a note from the artist. "Excellence" is a great name for these pieces. <end>
 B000FW7UJM  Solid Stainless Steel Cable and Rubber Bracelet, 8 inch long ||	  Beautiful but faulty Clasp  I love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective. I contacted Sabrina, and they were great about sending me a new one ASAP, with a label for returning the other one. That was impressive, and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued. Still, the clasp is a product defect, and I'm sure one of these days I will probably loose the bracelet b/c it comes undone unknowingly. <end>
 B000FWCTPC  SHINING IMAGE HUGE BLACK LEATHER JEWELRY BOX / CASE / STORAGE / ORGANIZER WITH TRAVEL CASE AND LOCK ||	  You get what you pay for  If you're looking for high quality that's durable, anti-tarnish and giftable--something worth passing on to loved ones as a family heirloom, perhaps-- keep looking. I would not give this as a gift, as I'm not real confident it will hold up for too very long, but for myself, it'll suffice--for now. At least one compartment arrived slightly but visibly warped, another, rather difficult to open. The necklace hooks are rather skimpish and more suitable for smaller pieces--not much good for '06 styles which are more generous in size. I'm not disappointed because I didn't expect a whole lot for $45 so at least I won't be crushed if anything happens to this on my trips, which is what I'll reserve this for--although, it doesn't hold quite as much as I expected, certainly not adequate room for my earrings. Overall, it is a fair and attractive piece and worth the $45 I paid, but not a cent more. (I've seen it go for more is why I'm saying) <end>  The least expensive  This box is selling in several places here for a lot more than this price. However, it is barely worth $43.90 + shipping charges. I also should mention that the ring sections are so close together, that if you have anything wider than a solitaire....you will be out of luck. The setting of the ring will cover up the next row of rings, so you have to offset each ring you put in a row ! Cuts the ring storage space in half. Most right hand rings are NOT solitaire settings and cluster gemstone rings are a particular nightmare to store in this....and the chain storage is basically worthless. You have to wind chains around each other so they won't hang down & you can close the case. If this is a 3 star product... It is just barely... <end>  Lots of storage!  This box has a large amount of storage in a compact space. Drawers are configurable by removing spacers so you can have more smaller compartments or fewer larger ones. I like the variety of spaces provided (for example, when you remove the travel box, the deep square compartment it sits in is perfect for my larger bracelets) and the extra pockets along both of the swing out side sections and below the mirror. The travel box is an added bonus. I wanted a lot of storage space without paying hundreds of dollars for a wooden box, and this fit the bill perfectly. <end>  JEWELRY BOX  FINALLY .. my jewelry is in ONE place and not in boxes. Easy to see what I want .. no more rummaging thru drawers and little boxes trying to find the RIGHT earrings or bracelet.. Looks nice too! <end>  Problem with latch  I agree with the previous reviewer  you get what you pay for. If this wasn't such a big bulky item, I'd return it. There is a problem with the front latch that holds the case together. It just won't latch unless you pull the front large flap toward you while pushing the latch into the hole with the other hand. Not easy....Otherwise the front will fall open and well, that just won't work....I had a few extra pieces of jewelry that I don't wear that often that I needed to have a place to store. This fit that purpose. But no way would I travel with this.Not even convinced it's worth $52.89 (with shipping).... <end>
 B000FWI8Y8  Spike Flashing White Ring-set of 2 ||	  Great as a stocking stuffer  This was fun for the kids to have just something extra in along with all of the other junk they tend to get. these were a hit! <end>
 B000FXSJU0  Anti-Tarnish Sterling Silver 17" Necklace with Leaves, Flowers, and Black Onyx Beads ||	  love it!!!  I love it - got lots of compliments.I am wanting to get the similar one with the different colors <end>
 B000FXUQJC  Pentagram Star Flames Pewter Cuff Bracelet ||	  Not a great buy  I bought one of these and within the month it broke. I contacted the seller and they quickly sent me a replacement. That one lasted about 2 months. I wouldn't buy it again that's for sure. <end>
 B000FXVZU6  French Horn Instrument Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Not impressed!  I bought this because it reminded me of my father, who played french horn when he was in high school. It came on a necklace that wouldn't even fit over my head. It was THAT small of a necklace...maybe it'll fit a kid or an infant, but definitely not an adult. Plus the band does not come apart without me having to take a pair of scissors and cut the band. There is no clip-type fastener. The french horn itself feels like it's made out of plastic or some other light weight material. If you are looking for a nice piece of jewelry, I do not recommend this piece. <end>  Great piece for the Horn lover!  I got this for my daughter who plays the French horn. She wears it all the time! <end>
 B000FXVZUG  Spider Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  A Handsome Conversation Starter  The simplest way to start conversation is to give people openings to do so. This necklace has been like a gigantic "Talk to Me" sign around my neck. It is quite the showpiece."Why a spider?" "What is that?" "That is so cool!" I'm a sucker for cheap attention and this spider necklace elicits it in spades.It's as handsome as the picture would lead you to imagine. I wish it was glossier but it is pewter so one cannot be too disappointed. If this design was ever released in stainless steel or silver, I would hungrily buy it again.Nevertheless, I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it. <end>  Great Buy  This pendant looks as good as the picture and comes with an adjustable black cord necklace that is so cool. I am so happy I got this and Dan's gave me some great service. <end>  Semi happy  Product arrived in good condition, within a week the legs all broke off of the spider. So not very good quality. <end>
 B000FXVZVA  Red Cherries Pewter Pendant Necklace ||	  Cherry Necklace  I bought this a few months ago and whenever I wear it I always receive compliments on it. It is a nice size and weight and I love how shiny it is. I am now going to purchase one for my friend because she likes it so much. <end>  glad i bought it  I bought this necklace for my daughter a month ago, and she loves it! She never takes it off. Definitely worth the money! <end>  Best Unique Charm  When I give this cherries necklece to some of my ladies they always go balistic because i only give one away per vacation. So far i've given 4 away and everyone doesn't want anything except this Charm....Perfect Size <end>  Shiny but...  shipping is quick and the thing is shiny. the item arrive in perfect condition tho. <end>
 B000FXXO82  Marble Wood Finish 100 Cigar Humidor ||	  update  I had left a review for this product, not to long ago, that was not the best. I had sent an email to the company stating that the hygrometer was not working properly and I never received a response. They called me eventually because of the bad review I had left and said that they had never received the email I sent. I am choosing to re-review this product now because, granted email is not always reliable and now that I have had this humidor for a length of time my feelings have changed. I would like now to state that this product is a very reliable piece. It has been almost a month since the last time I recharged the humidification devises and they are completely dried out. This is a good thing as far as I am concerned because, I am having a problem still with keeping the humidity lower at the proper level. This tells me that this humidor has an excellent seal. My hygrometer still does not work (the one that came with the humidor; I have since bought a digital one) but the company did offer to replace it for me when I had talked to them. I did not have it replaced because with the size of the humidor it took almost 2 or 3 weeks to season it and prepare it for cigar storage, so I declined their offer. As far recommending this product, I would definitely recommend it. I am not to partial to the pull out shelf but it doe <end>  Humidor  Purchased as an anniversary gift and it is just beautiful. Service was great, too. No problems at all with the order. <end>
 B000FXXTAK  AugustinaJewelry Freshwater Cultured Round Shape 8-8.5mm Black Pearl / 18K White Gold Pendant, 16" Sterling Silver 1MM Cable Chain ||	  Nice Pearl!  Purchased this pearl in replacement of the oval one I previously ordered from this company. Both pearls were equally nice and dark in color. I chose to keep the round one because the wife preferred it. I personally thought the oval was prettier but what do I know  ).This seller ships fast and sells great looking pearls! Recommended! <end>  Freshwater black pearl  I returned the freshwater black pearl drop necklace. It was beautiful, but I wanted black and this pearl was grey. <end>  Black Pearl  The pearl itself is beautiful. The chain was flimsier than I had anticipated. It was also very short. The chain should be at least 18". <end>  gorgeous  I received this as an anniversary gift from my husband who's deployed overseas right now. Simple, beautiful, and looks great with everything. wonderful for casual and formal. I absolutely LOVE it. <end>
 B000FZ3UDY  Sterling Silver Genuine Rainbow Moonstone Celtic Knot 7" Link Bracelet ||	  Moonstone Celtic Knot Bracelet  I am very pleased with my new Sterling Silver Genuine Rainbow Moonstone Celtic Knot 7" Link Bracelet. It sparkles in the sunlight and is fun to wear. Most of my bracelets are gold, so the sterline silver is a change and probably why I notice it so often when it sparkles and reflects the light. I received a gift certificate for Amazon and was insecure to order by myself. My daughter helped me to do everything correctly and it arrived shortly afterward. I'm definitely pleased with my selection. Thanks. <end>
 B000FZ3UG6  Sterling Silver 9mm Wide Celtic Knot Cross Spinning Spin Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  Sentimental  For me, this ring was one of the best ones I've ever owned (and the longest at that). The spinning mechanism will never cease to entertain me despite years of wearing it (and people are always asking if they could play with it). It's made of sterling silver so it will scratch and tarnish over time, but this isn't something a little ammonia or soap wont take care of. The gaps between the interior band provides air ventilation for your finger; it gunks up from time to time, but as I've said before you have to clean it once in a while. Sadly I lost the ring a couple years ago, and would absolutely purchase another one if the price was lower. Otherwise, I really appreciated this piece of jewelry. <end>  Awesome products  Attention all silver consumers! The products sold by Silver Insanity are exceptioanl. I have purchased a total of seven spining rings and they are of the highest quality. The rings are exceptionally crafted, the detailed designs are very original, the spinning is smooth, and the weight of the rigns is perfect. I only hope that this company comes up with new desaigns because I will, without a doubt, continue purchasing my rings through them. Furthermore, the customer service is excellent. Twice I ordred the wrong size rings and it ws no problem to have them replaced. The company seem to be well organized in record keepiing and truly eager to satisfy the customer. They are fantastic! <end>  very poor  Sterling Silver 9mm Wide Celtic Knot Cross Spinning Spin Ring (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)this ring WAS a spinner ring. the darkened part was gone within days and the "spinner" inside section broke and fell out in 10 days. there has been no response from e-mails to the company yet. <end>  Nice ring  This ring is nice, but not as dark as pictured. The crosses are lighter than they look in the picture, so that is why I give it 4 stars. <end>  Beautiful!  This ring is absolutely wonderful! It was just what I was looking for in a spinner ring -- shine and width. It is just as it was described in the information provided. I love it!! <end>  strong silver  i replaced all my silver flimsy rings with thicker stronger ones and this ring is one of the great ones! i wear it as a thumb ring and have had it a few years...it hasen't bent yet and i never take my jewlery off!!! <end>
 B000FZ51YU  RED COLOR CUBIC ZIRCONIA CROWN RING, 9 ||	  Cute, but not comfortable  This is a beautiful ring, but wearing it is another matter. It should have been smooth on the back side, instead it is the same all the way around and is very uncomfortable to wear. I tried to wear it, but gave up and now it sits in the drawer. Too bad! <end>
 B000FZ5K00  Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh with Trinity Knots and Emerald-Green Glass Stone Teardrop Adjustable 17" Necklace ||	  love...love..love..!!!  I wish I could buy it all,Great vender with the most beautiful celtic jewlery.Also prompt service everything arrives pefect.Thank you <end>  Beautiful  This Claddagh is one of the most beautiful I have seen thank you for the prompt service too! <end>  WIfe loves this  I got this for my wife and she loves it, its very pretty and well made, what more can you ask for. <end>  Trinity Knot and Claddagh Necklace  Although the necklace is not as "delicate" as I had anticipate, very pretty. Excellent silver work, great value. <end>  Gorgeous  I bought it and used it for my wedding day. Simple and gorgeous . Everybody loved it and the shipment was on time! <end>  Beautiful item!  Picked this up as a gift for my fiancee as she is 100% Irish and I wanted to get her a claddagh necklace (as she would have no room for a ring). The necklace really is beautiful. She loves it. <end>
 B000FZ5K3W  Sterling Silver Dark Blue Sapphire Celtic Knot Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  Silver bracelet  The service was excellent and the quality of the jewelry was much better than expected. I have bought from this store several times before and never been disappointed. <end>  I love this bracelet but......  I love this bracelet but the toggle closure should be larger. The design of the bracelet is gorgeous but the clasp does not set off the bracelet as it should be. <end>  Sterling Silver Dark Blue Sapphire Celtic Knot Bracelet  This bracelet is very cheesy, for the Price.According to picture you expect better quality. Than you email them to send it back and they don't return your email. Remember when you order this product, you have to return it to the seller,not amazon!!! <end>  Nice bracelet  This bracelet was a gift so i'm happy it was of a good quality. The only thing that could be better is the clasp...it's too big and the bracelet falls off sometimes. She changed it to a lobster claw. <end>
 B000FZ71CU  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Triple Moon Phases Genuine Garnet 17" Necklace ||	  To expensive for what you get.  This is really sterling silver, but the back side of the jewelry is carved out. It reminds you of jewelry I used to get out of the 25 cent gum ball machine. <end>  amazing  I have had this necklace for quite some time now and it still looks like new. I would recommend this to anyone who likes moons, or who believe in the Goddess. <end>
 B000G08YHK  Sterling Silver Mesh Cuff Bracelet ||	  Mother-in-Law gift  I ordered a beautiful silver bracelet for my very elegant and wonderful mother-in-law.

 B000G0DRG8  The Sparkling Multi Color Kaleidoscope Bracelet ||	  Beautiful stunner  This multi-coloured CZ bracelet caught my eyes because it's dancing with vibrance. The multi-colours are captivating & the CZs are well-cut, sparkling & thick. The workmanship is good with smooth finishing. It's glamourous looking & can dress-up any outfit instantly. It's a one-of-its kind design & I can't find it in any other website. I'm fortunate to own it. <end>

 B000G1K2H4  Elvis Presley Collection Graceland Italian Charm ||	  Love it!  I just got this one and I love it! If you've ever seen Graceland it's a fantastic representation on a very small scale. If you're an Elvis fan this is a must have. <end>
 B000G22GJU  Filigree Yin Yang Pewter Ring, Size 11 ||	  Finger Stayed White!  I love the ring! The design is cool, especially if, like me, you like Yin Yang. I ordered it one size to big, but slipped it on my middle finger and it fits fine. So now when I shoot people the bird, they know I am a well-balanced person. Haha. Anyways, the ring is great, my finger never turned green, and I highly recommend it!Also, I bought from Dan Jewelers, so I highly recommend them as well! <end>  Should specify men's ring...  In the picture it doesn't look as bulky as it really is. I got it for my middle finger and it looks SOO big. If it had said men's ring I wouldn't have ordered it. It fit, but it's obviously not a woman's ring or even unisex. <end>
 B000G2KDN6  Hello Kitty Hula Girl Cat Animal Theme Licensed Charm Bracelet ||	  Super Cute!  I love anything Hello Kitty and this charm is super cute. The quality is good, too, and it looks exactly like the picture. <end>
 B000G2M5LE  Sterling Silver Black Enamel Animal Paw, Howling Silhouette, and Wolf Head Ring(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) ||	  Wolf Head Ring  Excellent shipping procedures and no problem with return, first item was too small. Ring chart a little off, by about a half a size. Great looking and people give me lots of compliments on it. Great buy, very pleased/ <end>  Best ever  Got as a gift for my daughter came in fast perfect size work was amazing my daughter said it was better then any gift she has ever gotn and wears it every day Thank you for such a wonderful gift all this time has passed she wears this ring every day and is still mint condition thank you so much <end>  Not worth it!  I was very disappointed in the quality of this ring. It is small, very light in weight, and looks dull, cheap and fragile. You cannot see the features clearly on the ring as is shown in the picture. If I had seen this ring in person, I definitely would not have bought it as it certainly was not worth $89.00! <end>  garnet and silver necklace  this is a very pretty necklace and if like me you like garnets and silver, this is a must have. It was reasonably priced and delivery was was very good as I live in the UK. <end>
 B000G6JMAC  Pugster Murano Glass Orange And Gold Star Necklace Pendant ||	  Pugster Orange Gold Star  This star means summer. That's the way I see it and that's why I bought it. It's orange and gold tones blended together along with the foil backdrop brings any outfit to life, iluminates your face and it's an eye catcher too. Check on my customer's images above to see what I'm talking about. Bet you'll get yourself one too! <end>  Beautiful starfish  Every time I wear this necklace, I get compliments on it. The one that I originally wanted they were out of, but this is really pretty. I am very happy with my purchase. I would recommend this to a friend. <end>

 B000G7TEFO  Sterling Silver Bar and X Turquoise Blue Enamel Ring ||	  OK ring.  I ordered several rings from this seller, but this is my least favorite. The enamel lines are not perfect with the cz lines, if that makes sense. I see runover. Pretty ring though because of the color. <end>
 B000G7XSS8  Designer Inspired Multi Color CZ Cable Ring ||	  Worth every penny!  Was looking for some inexpensive, nice looking rings and took a chance on this. I'm happy with everything about this ring. It's light weight, keeps its shine. I love the different colored stones in it. You can't really lose on this one. It's exactly as it's pictured. Arrived very quickly. Purchased other rings from this seller and all have been perfect. Look for sales, though. Some of the prices are kinda high. But, the styles are nice. <end>
 B000G9S8A4  Sterling Silver Oval Black Onyx Ponytail Holder Hair Barrette Clip ||	  Classy  Beautiful item but I had to return it because my ponytail was too thin (postpartum hair)--it just fell right off. Was afraid to keep for later for the price. Great service from Silver Insanity though. <end>
 B000GAAKK4  Sterling Silver Bezel Set Garnet Eternity Band ||	  Absolutely Beautiful!!!  I received this as a birthday gift and it is just gorgeous! The picture here does not do this ring justice!

 B000GAAVKS  10k White Gold Men's Onyx And Diamond Claddagh Ring ||	  a little cheap  I bought this for my boyfriend about 2 years ago, and it has held up ok. Its an awesome looking and different claddagh, he's gotten alot of comments on it. Like a week after I bought it he got it caught on something and the whole back split open, but it fixed ok at the jeweller, the color is now more of a yellow/champagne color. We've had to take it somewhere twice to have the onyx part tightened in the back because it comes loose and clicks around. Overall i'm glad I bought it but wish it was a little more quality and as sturdy as it looks in the pic. <end>  moving  My husband received this gift from a very dear friend and I thought it was a very moving gift. Not to mention, it looks great. Excellently packaged. <end>  Touching Gift  I bought this ring as a gift to a close friend who was moving abroad. He absolutely loved it and said it was one of the most heart felt gifts he's ever received. The ring was quite handsome and had a tremendous luster. I received it in a timely fashion and it was packaged very well. No complaints. <end>

 B000GC7A5U  Alabama Crimson Tide ( University Of ) NCAA Executive Logo Cufflinks ||	  Not what you see  I ordered these cufflinks for a gift...but was sent something totally different. They attached a letter to the gift stating they were sorry but they dont carry this item (the picture that is shown), with a sob story about they can not change the picture...that is totally false. I will never trust this company again. I am sending the crap back that they sent me <end>
 B000GDBBNQ  Morningflower Oval Pink Opal Post Earrings ||	  Unusual Opal post earrings  Lovely, silver, post Opal earrings. Not a common color; a mix of pinks and blues. Quite stunning. The push-on backs had holes that were too large and I lost one of the earrings in the first month I had them.  ( <end>
 B000GDMGF8  Leather choker, 'Shell Spirals' 0.2" W 17.9" L ||	  Lovely unique necklace  Great unique style, looks even better than on the picture. Stands out but is not overwhelming. Quality product.Why four stars? As for a choker it's on a longer side. You may want to check how 17.9 inches compares to your collar size. <end>
 B000GDTMVY  Women's 14k White-gold (1/2 CT) 4.5mm Princess-cut Moissanite Solitaire Engagement Ring ||	  The Perfect Ring!  My boyfriend (Now Fiance!) proposed to me a couple of weeks ago with this ring. We had talked about what kind of ring we were going to get and after some research we decided on a moissanite ring. It is nearly as hard as a diamond so it will never scratch or become dull, but much clearer and more brilliant than a diamond. We were blown away when we saw the ring for the first time. In the sunlight it is absolutely dazzling. The stone looks like a very high quality diamond, and not a cheap imitation. The setting is simple and beautiful. I have very small hands, so the thin band and the .5 ct stone are perfect. I could not be happier with this ring! <end>
 B000GDZCW2  Pugster Size 9 Feather & Leaf Rings ||	  Great simple ring  Perfect for those days when you want something simple but interesting. Graceful engraving, has more shine than photo shows. 4mm wide on face. Design does not go all the way around (at least on size 7) but transition looks nice, with the feathers having a beginning and end. Sizing on 7 was a little on the smallish side. Sturdy but comfortable to wear. A winner! <end>
 B000GEEDG2  Sterling Silver Filigree Heart Scent Locket Pendant with Antiqued 18" Chain Necklace ||	  Scent Locket  I absolutely love this locket! For the scented part, I use a small piece of felt and spray perfume on it. Great size, not gaudy but not so tiny you can't put something in it. <end>
 B000GEFYWO  Perfume Scent Holder Bottle Sterling Silver Pendant ||	  needs a funnel and leaks  This was purchased as a gift, and it does need a tiny funnel, in order to fill properly. It leaks, so it stained her tops, not recommended. <end>

 B000GHKG9W  White Mother Of Pearl Enduring Heart Pendant, 14k Gold ||	  Mother of Pearl Pendant  I waited a long time to order this pendant and was disappointed. The gold latch is a little too large and the stone is a very poor piece. It has several different colors and grains going in different directions with different kinds of shines to it. It is not a smooth white piece like the picture. <end>
 B000GHUQ4C  Top Mount Purple Pink Odyssey Cubic Zirconia Belly Ring ||	  a shame  It's a really cute piece of jewelry. Too bad it fell apart the very first day I wore it and no one at the company would get back to me about a replacement. <end>
 B000GI7IC4  Pugster Jewelry Bearded Men Beads Fit Pandora Chamilia Biagi Charm & Bracelet ||	  Waited and Waited  It seems like I waited and waited for this bead, but I really did not have to wait too long. I ordered it on the 1st and it arrived on the 6th. I was anticipating getting a nice large bead with a dark brown backgrownd with a Spiral blue line and a Spiral black line on it. That is what the picture looks like and what their description suggests. Instead the bead looks as follows  it is large, larger than most Pandora beads being 14 mm in diameter and 10 mm wide including the silver around the hole. Instead of being dark brown, it is a brown/gold color and intead of being dull, it is quite shiny. It does have a blue Spiral line off to one side as shown and it is light blue. It also has reddish purple line around it where the black line appears to be. In additon there are 3 pencil thin black lines going around the bead in the direction of the blue line. These lines are black. It is quite light when weighed in the palm of the hand. Some beads have substance to them in terms of weight, this one does not. Almost makes me think it is spun glass. So, if you are good at pictures in your head, you now have an idea of what the bead is really like. It is not necessarily a bad bead, but it is certainly not as pictured. I may send it back. It depends. I have ordered two more beads from them that are to be similar to this and it depends on how they look and how this one looks with them. I hope you have an easier time deciding with the description I have given you. <end>
 B000GIAD4Y  10mm Wide Mens Titanium Brushed Satin Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 8,9,10,11,12,13) ||	  A Beautiful Ring for the money  I was pleasently surprised at how nice this ring looks. It is very simple yet elegant. The only problem my husband has with it is that the finish is easily scratched but if you are not studying it closely you can't really tell. I think it is a great buy for the money. <end>  Nice ring, only one issue  I purchased this ring for my fiance. Overall we both love it, but as was already stated, the finish does scratch easily. From a distance you can't really notice it, but it is visible if you are really looking at the ring.The service was fast and exactly what we expected. <end>

 B000GIUH22  Mele Mia Girl's Ballerina Jewelry Box 822-11M ||	  Very good.  The product is very good and meets expectations. I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product. <end>  My daughter loves it!  My daughter got this for her 4th birthday and loves it. It has the classic ballerina that spins around to music. It plays "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" from Wizard of Oz. She loves to put special things inside (anything that will fit) and dance to the music. It is really special to her. It is a great sweet gift for a little girl who loves girly things. <end>  Stands up to a four year old!  This is the perfect starter jewelry box for a 4 or 5 year old. Not to many things to break and easy to open. My 4 year old granddaughter opens and closes it all day long and it still works. It also has enough storage for a little ones jewelry. <end>  Junk  I put this on my daughters wish list and a relative purchased it for Christmas. I had promised to wrap it for the sender, and good thing because I never gave it to my daughter. When I opened it the ballerina was broken off (and could not be glued, I tried) and it is made so poorly for $27!! This wouldn't have lasted a week with my three kids and it looked so nice in the photos... <end>  Jewelry Box  The jewelry box is pretty and the child who received it is delighted with it. <end>

They are very elegant looking and were a big hit with my mother. I received excellent customer service from Harris Michael Jewelry and will by purchasing from them shortly. <end>
 B000GM0818  AugustinaJewelry Single Strand 18 Inch 6.0-7.0mm White Semi-Round Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace ||	  lovely necklace  This is a lovely pearl necklace. The pearls have a nice luster and the necklace lays very comfortably on my neck. it is just what I wanted, and I am very pleased with it. <end>  pretty.  got here fast and packaged well, i do have to mention that the pearls are not perfectly round, or the same exact size like in the picture. i'm guessing that how pearls turned out and with the price that i paid for it, these are perfect. i have to also mention that these are a little bit more weighted than if you buy pearl necklace that are perfect looking with the same price. <end>  Lovely Pearl Necklace  This is a very nice pearl necklace. The pearls have a nice sheen, very good in size of and the pearls are uniform looking on the string. I would certainly purchase these pearls again as gift for family and friends. The clasp is nice and works well on this necklace. This pearl necklace will work for everyday use for work and casual get togethers. Very classy. Great job.Thank you! <end>  I love these  These pearls are very beautiful. The string is not stiff and the closure is a typical fishhook found on most pearl strands. Love this necklace. <end>  Love these  Bought for my 16 year old granddaughter for Easter. Her first string of real pearls....what a treasure they are..weighty and just beautiful <end>  Great Value for lovely pearls  I got these for my wife for a gift after she had our first child, she loves tham and they match her pearl ear rings. <end>  Great Gift! Absolutely Beautiful!!!  I ordered this necklace along with the suggested earrings for my teenage daughter as an early Christmas gift, and could not have been more pleased. The necklace and earrings are beautiful; they arrived quickly; and best of all, my daughter "LOVED" the set (anyone with a teenage daughter, knows that's no small feat). The look on her face was priceless. She's going to Broadway and Radio City with her dad, and can't wait to wear them. <end>  Looks Great at an affordable price  I wanted to buy a pearl set to go with an outfit, but the real Pearl sets cost $150-200 for what I was looking for. Since I wouldn't wear them all that much, I couldn't justify spending that much. These did the job - Looks Great and Affordable. What more can you ask for?! <end>
 B000GOTRYU  Designer Inspired Cubic Zirconia Eternity Band, 8 ||	  Beautiful and realistic  This eternity band is very nice. The CZ is pretty realistic. If you're looking for a nice accent to an existing ring, but are on a budget, this is a good choice. <end>  Brigth and beautiful  Is much more than I expected for the price... It was a x-mas gift for my niece (13 yo) and she loved it as much as I did. I totally recommended <end>
 B000GOXT44  Qlink EMF Protection Pendant (White) - New Design -LOWEST PRICE!! ||	  Feel much better in all day office setting  This little pendant is a life saver for anyone with a desk job. I'm surrounded by fluorescent lights, computers, phones, wifi, screens, and other devices which emit non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation detrimental to the natural human being operational frequency.Before wearing this pendant, I would feel totally drained after a day at the office, and get tension-fatigue headaches...my brain and body were just groggy from the electronics-dense environment. The first day I started wearing this pendant, i've never felt that way again, and now I'm just fine in the office.I've been wearing the Q-link pendant every day for two years, and I purchased one for each of my family members. I notice a different attitude and behavior in my wife and child when they are not wearing theirs. The effects are subtle but noticable - to a lesser extent in magnitude than the profound change which accompanies repentance and baptism, but a good comparison for explaining subtle but noticable differences in one's countenance and mindset. <end>

 B000GPRWOG  8mm Wide Mens Titanium Etched Celtic Knot Pattern Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 8,9,10,11,12,13) ||	  Great price and quality is good  This ring is very nice. Also shipping from this company was extremely efficient and fast. Titanium is great for durability, but the surface of the ring scratchs and the pattern does not look quite as good after some regular wear. <end>  C-H-E-A-P  This ring is cheap and doesn't feel sturdy or even real. Actually, I don't think it is real titanium. <end>  LOVED IT  Loved this product! My husband is very proud to wear this ring. It is EXACTLY what we wanted for him. <end>  wedding ring  Luckily, the ring arrived just before we were leaving for our wedding ( we ordered it a little late  ) ) However, it did not fit even though we used the site's ring sizer. We followed their directions to exchange it and are still waiting to receive the new ring. <end>
 B000GPRWPU  Courtney Davis Sterling Silver Purple Celtic Unicorn Medallion Pendant Necklace ||	  Beautiful piece of jewelry!  This is a wonderful piece of jewelry. The intricacy is amazing and the silver work is very detailed. I am not giving this 5 stars because I was somewhat upset that this cost so much when it does not even come on a real chain and the fact that the pendant itself is extremely light! It does not feel like a quality piece of jewelry and for the price, I would have thought it would feel heavier and not so trinket like. I still really love it. But I think it should only cost about 30 dollars. <end>  Very light  The detailing is great, but it is very light....about the thickness of a dime. There's only enough silver behind the design to hold it into place & unevenly at that. The back is kinda lumpy, definitely not worth this kind of money. I agree with the previous reviewer, worth about $30. <end>  Beautiful  I've always been in fond of celtic stuff, and i had no idea amazon sells celtic jewelry. When i saw my celtic unicorn i immediately fell in love ,and i knew i had to have him. the design is incredibly intricate and well made, and it's not as huge as i expected (just big enough) , and looking at him makes me remember beautiful memories. My only complaint is about the silk cord, because it's too long, but everything else is just great. <end>  Very nice  I get from a friend in USAshe said she love it .. thanks <end>

 B000GSLHK8  Amazon.com  Choker Austrian Crystal Rhinestones Stretch 2 Rows SeXy Gift  Clothing ||	  Looks great on her  Product is well made. Stretchy material to allow for full range of movement with the neck. Wasn't expensive, but looks like it might be. Accentuates all of the gf's outfits. Makes any outfit look sexier. Great purchase. Thanks! <end>  Lovely!  This is a beautiful choker. Simple and tasteful. You could dress up any outfit with just this alone. I would definitely recommend it. <end>  she loved it!!  bought this for my girl. she looks so hot in it and loves it.. and me for getting it for her <end>  niece loved it  looked stunning on my niece. She loved it was xmas present... Purchased earrings, bracelet and ring to match....all separate pieces and went very well together. <end>  comes as advertised  This comes in a plastic envelope -- obviously gag jewelry ... costume jewelry -- but that's what I ordered.It arrived as advertised and the seller did a a great job ensuring customer satisfaction. Kudos all around.As you may imagine, it's nothing special and feels cheap, but as costume jewelry, it does the job. <end>
 B000GUW5JI  Garnet Oval Marcasite Pendant ||	  Heirloom quality  I have purchased this garnet/marcasite pendant and have to say I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The marcasites add just the right touch and the garnet itself is of excellent quality. I was even thinking it would be a bit smaller than I thought, so I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the pendant and it's appearance! So many of my friends & coworkers comment it looks like a wonderful heirloom piece, and it's been proudly worn daily since I got it! Again I say for the price, you won't be disappointed in the least. Service was quick from the time I ordered & it came in a box suitable for gift-giving. I am totally pleased with this pendant and would not hesitate to order from this company again! <end>
 B000GVMOPM  Nickel Free Sterling Silver 2mm Italian Snake Chain Necklace ||	  Beautiful Chain, Happy Customer  I bought this chain for my son's Marine Corps cross. It matches beautifully and is solid and durable enough to withstand the rigors of his work in the Marine Corps. It is really a gorgeous chain of excellent quality, and the seller couldn't have been easier to deal with - fast shipping, nicely packaged, easy transaction. I would definitely purchase from them again. <end>  22 inch chain  i purchased this chain to match a sterling silver cross i bought, i was plesantly suprised, the chain was very good quality and matched perfectlyi would highly recomend this store for quality and service. <end>  Lovely chain  The shipper was hard to get hold of, but finally responded with a positive attitude. The necklaces are perfect and goes well with the pendant I had made from a rather pricey ring. The necklace is a perfect match. <end>  Very pretty chain, well made and well priced  I spent a lot of time shopping for the perfect chain to go with a pricey pendant I bought for my daughter and finally purchased this one. So happy I did. She loves it -- she's very jewelry savvy, having bought pieces all over the world.Also, I bought rather late for Christmas delivery, but the chain got there on time, all the way across the country. I'll check this vendor first next time I want casual jewelry. <end>  Excellence  The 2 mm, 30 inch silver chain from Gem is superb. It currently is used to hold a larger religious medal, the fit is very comfortable all day long and well worth the price. For smaller medals the 1 mm medal is very good, but for a larger medal the 2 mm chain is superbly well-crafted and exceptionally comfortable. Anticipate purchasing a second 2 mm chain for a three-inch cross recently ordered. Great seller, great product, a job well done! <end>  Beautiful and luminous  I bought this resplendent, silver chain as a late Christmas present for my girlfriend. She opened it and hasn't taken it off since. A classic piece of jewelry for any girl's collection, this gleaming necklace is an A+. <end>  silver chain  I ordered both the 1mm and 2mm silver chain and much prefer the 2mm one. It has a nice 'feel' and I think it will last better than the 1mm chain. <end>
 B000GVOAR2  Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1mm Snake Chain Necklace ||	  Beautiful and perfect chain  This Sterling Silver 1 mm Italian snake chain,24", is beautiful and perfect for the different pendants that I like to wear. I wanted it to be dainty but strong. Delivery was fast and correspondence has been efficient and tactful! Will definitely order from Gem Avenue again!D.I. Jackson <end>  BEAUTIFUL AND GREAT PRICE  These necklaces are a reasonable price and beautiful quality. I ordered several sizes to wear with various necklines and I am pleased with all of them. Quickly shipped and beautifully gift boxed. <end>  S.S MM Italian Snake Chain  The chain is beautiful. It is all that I expected it to be and more. I am very pleased with this seller's merchandise and would definitely buy from them again. <end>  Perfect  Originally I was looking for a simple chain for a specific pendant. I wanted it to be strong and dainty. When it arrived I was surprised that it was boxed for a gift. The chain was beautiful, but I was disappointed that it was dented. I emailed Gem Avenue, received a lovely note back, and within a few days had a perfect necklace that I wear everyday. I am very pleased. <end>  Beatiful chain  This chain is very durable. It looks great with a pendant. The lobster clasp is a plus. <end>  Avoid at all cost!!!  I bought a couple of these, and now regret it greatly. In less then a week one of them broke. If I didn't know better I would think that they had been pulled at the way it broke between the link, also the clasp seemed stretched somewhat. In any case, I would avoid it, and find a higher quality necklace someplace else. <end>  Very Good quality  This snake chain was exactly what I wanted and was very good quality. I'd buy from this seller again. <end>  First rate sterling silver chain  I have purchased so many incredibly affordable, lovely silver chains and necklaces from Gem Ave. that I know they can be relied on for all of the things that are important to a consumer - quality, value, good delivery, and accomodating customer service. I will be proud to give this pretty snake chain, paired with a silver or gemstone pendant, as a Christmas or birthday gift. Simple, appropriately sized gift boxes are provided (for your wrapping pleasure!!!). Note  The Omega chains come with boxes slightly larger than the thin snake chains. At these prices, I'm glad to get a box at all!! I'm a definite fan! <end>
 B000GWRHJ4  6mm Wide Mens and Womens Titanium Etched Celtic Knot Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  Pretty but...  Very pretty ring. The etching does show, but barely. I hadn't seen Titanium rings before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was hoping it would appear a bit more silver, or glowing. The ring finish is very dull, and sort of reminds me of old aluminum in color and reflection.But Hubby likes it, and thats what I was hoping for. It fits nicely, and although it wasn't quite what I was expecting, the finish of the ring is very nice. <end>  great ring!  I purchased this ring to wear at work and couldn't be happier! It fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. I've gotten many compliments on the ring as well! <end>  Wonderful product  The rings come in faster then expected. They are even better looking in person then on the site...Totally love them THANKS SO MUCH!! <end>  I love this ring.  I ordered this ring for my husband as we are celebrating our 23 wedding anniversary this year. The company delivered quick and I am very very pleased with the ring. The only thing I wish that could have been different, was I wish I had been given the chance to have it engraved by the company. I took it somewhere else to have it engraved and I was NOT pleased with the quality of the engraving. So, Silver Insanity, if you read this, please take into consideration an option that allows for engraving. I would have gladly paid more for engraving. I repeat however, THE RING IS BEAUTIFUL!!! Thank you S.I. <end>  Nice Ring  The ring is well crafted with a simple design. It has square edges on the outside, so it is possible to pinch your other fingers or those of someone holding your hand, but this has not been a real issue. The inside of the ring is rounded, which is what causes the shadows in the pictures. I was worried that it would be a split ring when I was looking at some of the pictures because of the shadowing, but the band is solid. <end>  Beautiful Ring But Watch Sizing  The ring is beautiful. My only problem is the size. We printed out the page with the measurement instructions and measured per the instructions. My size came out a size 8. We ordered a size 8 for me; however, the ring is way too big on my finger. It falls off, in fact. I guess we will have to return it. Be aware of that. I suppose it could be that someone put size 8 sticker on a size 9 ring, or these rings run a size larger than what they claim. I don't know. I thought it was strange that my size was an 8, but that is what came up when we measured (based off their measurement instructions).The ring is very pretty. I like it. Just be aware of the sizing. <end>  A Nice Ring  I chose this one because I needed something indestructable for work. Also, it looked good on the screen.When I received it, I pleasantly surprised about how nice it looked. I really like it. <end>  Lovely!  I was looking for a nice wedding band to wear when I go camping, biking, etc. so my diamond ring doesn't get damanged. I found this lovely ring and ordered it. My husband liked it so much that he ordered a matching one, too. The quality is excellent and the rings are very pretty. They also fit really well - I've never had a comfort fit ring before and it really *is* very comfortable. The order arrived much faster than anticipated. I'll definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  Just perfect!  My husband and I couldn't decide what to get each other for Christmas. I found this ring and we both thought it would make the perfect gift. We each have one and they are the most comfortable rings. His wedding band is a comfort fit so he was familiar with the way this ring fits. I have never had anything with a comfort fit band so it took a little getting used to but I just love the way it fits. The band is so smooth! I was very pleased with how easy it was to communicate with the people at Silver Insanity. They responded promptly to my emails and answered all my questions. I will glady buy from them again. <end>  Excellent  ]  Nearly three years ago now my husband and I got married. We did a very basic ceremony in a courthouse and did not want rings or lots of pomp and circumstance about the wedding. We later decided that we should have a symbol of our committment and so we began to look for rings that were good representations of ourselves; high-quality and simple. This was the ring both of us agreed upon and we have never regretted it =). It is a bit darker than in the photo after a while, but the pattern etched into the band is still as beautiful as ever and I still have people give me compliments on how elegant it looks. Other reviewers said they had problems with chips and scratches on their rings but it's been over 2 1/2 years and I never have. I fully recommend them! <end>  Celtic Knot Ring  This is a very nice mens ring. Comfortable and sturdy, yet very stylish. My husband loved it. <end>  Beautiful Ring!!!  I ordered this ring for my husband because he is Irish. He absolutely loved it and wears it all the time. We have bought him other rings and they have turned his skin colors. This one has been the exception. Great Product!! Fast Shipping!! I will order more from this seller! <end>  Nice  I bought these rings to replace our weeding bands when my husband lost his original. I love celtic inspired jewelry so I immediately chose this to be our new wedding rings. They are way more affordable than the white gold ones I looked at before and they look great! <end>  Beautiful  I recieved this today along with my black enameled one. I can tell already that my husband will be fighting me over this ring. The workmanship is beautiful. The celtic knot is thinly etched around the center of the ring with a band on either side. It has a brushed titanium look and an almost mystical appearance. I was looking for rings to add to our Halloween costumes, but I wanted something we could wear day to day if we should choose. I'm very pleased. <end>  what a shame!  what a shame! altough i'm a returning customer, the seller did not send me anything. Yes, not a thing. How can a serious company deceive the customers? Aw, and if you e-mailed the company complaining, nobody answer,not even a single line. Very bad, awful, indeed... <end>
 B000GWUN1S  Mens Single Stripe Brushed Satin Pure Titanium Wedding Band Ring(Sizes 8,9,10,11,12,13,14) ||	  What A Suprise!!  I wanted to get something really special for my boyfriend, something that he will like. When I saw this ring, I fell in love right away! I was a bit hesitate about ordering a ring online, but I gave it a shot, and WOW just WOW. I got the ring yesterday, just in time for Valentines day. The ring was beautiful! A tiny bit smaller then the picture shows, but I was shocked at how beautiful it worked. My boyfriend is a mechanic, so titanium is the perfect metal for him. I love this ring so much and he did too. If you're looking for a nice ring, but not trying to go extremely fancy, and not to expensive, this one is the one you should buy, it's perfect!! <end>  excellent value  The stripe brushed satin titanium band is better than expected. The ring is quite striking and more attractive than the photo. I accidentally ordered the wrong size, and titanium cannot be sized. The company handled the exchange with no issues and they were very easy to work with through email. <end>  awesome ring !  I really liked the ring on the internet. When I received it, it was so much better looking in person. My new husband just loves it !I will order from you again in the future. <end>  ringer  its okay for the price, but just ok. not very shiny. so we actually ended up buying a different ring. we got a tungston one instead, better look and still good price. <end>  Not like the picture.  We liked the picture online, and so we ordered it. It wasn't shiny like the picture made us think.It looks faded or dull. So not my choice for a wedding band, but...ya know. <end>  Not so great service.......  Received the ring in great time. It was as advertised. We immediately returned the ring for a different size - mailed as directed. The company say they still haven't received the return-it has been almost a month now. We will not reorder from this company again unless they receive the ring and replace it with another size immediately. <end>  Handsome ring  I got this ring for my husband as a wedding band and it's just perfect. He wanted something that would last forever and look good at the same time. We're both very please with the fit and look of the ring. <end>  Wonderful!  I ordered this ring for my husband for Christmas. I was more than happy when I opened it and saw how beautiful the ring actually was! My husband works in construction, and I was always afraid his old ring was going to get bent, but this new one hasn't even gotten a scratch on it! I'm more than satisfied. <end>
 B000GWZ8JK  14K 20" Yellow Gold Box Chain w/ CZ Bar Necklace ||	  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE - BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY!  This shopping experience was a nightmare. I ordered the necklace as a Christmas present. It arrived on 12/22, but was a different necklace than pictured. I immediately called and they said they'd ship the correct necklace via Next Day Air. The 2nd necklace arrived and was the same WRONG necklace. At this point, my Christmas present was ruined.I requested that they issue a Call Tag or send a shipping label for me to return the products. It took over 3 weeks and at least 8 phone calls to get the necklaces returned and a credit issued. Every time I called, I got a different excuse. I finally had to get their UPS account # and do it myself. On 3 occasions, I was assured that someone would return my call, and they NEVER did. I spent so much time on this - it was ridiculous.This was horrible from start to finish. I will never again order from this company. <end>
 B000GX9POS  Sterling Silver Rolo Link Chain w/ Lobster Lock w/ 14K Gold Round Charm - 7.5" ||	  don't buy this item  I rated this item once before because the first time that i wore it within 1/2 an hour the gold circle was gone -- not sodered on i would imagine. The company was nice enough to invite me to send it back to them (not worth the effort for me to walk over to the post office, pack it, etc.) so I just declined their great invite to exchange it. Anyway, i kept the bracelet on and believe it or not it turned blackish after about one week...anyway it is obviously junk. Please do not buy it - or you will be sorry as i am...junky silver... <end>
 B000GXCXR4  14K White Gold Rolo Link "I Love You" Charm Bracelet 7.2" ||	  A "U" Problem  I brought this bracelet for my girlfriend about two months ago, and she kept snagging the "U" on almost everything; her clothing, other bracelets, her hair, and even on me from time to time. Each time the "U" on this bracelet got caught in something, it'd slightly bend. Of course you can always bend it back, but after time, tension is going to cause it to just break off.If the person you plan on getting this for isn't going to wear it all the time, like every day, then yes, go ahead and get it for them. If you're quite sure they will wear it a majority of the time, I would suggest looking for another bracelet. <end>

 B000GZIKO2  14Kt Gold 1/3 ctw. Princess Cut Three-Stone Diamond Ring ||	  Doing business with NETAYA  I will have to admit that the ring I purchased from NETAYA was a beautiful ring and a good buy, but I would never do business with NETAYA again. I am currently deployed in Iraq and the only way I have of purchasing gifts is over the internet. Because of perfect customer service I have revieved from Amazon I thought I could depend on the sellers associated with Amazon as well. Don't be fooled. I ordered this ring on Nov 27 so I could be sure that it arrived by Christmas. I became concerned Dec 15th that I had not recieved a shipment notice because the estimated delivery date was the 18th of Dec and sent an email that went unanswered as well as two more emails that were never answered. I went ahead and chose another ring from SZUL and ordered it on the 19th of Dec and I recieved shipment notice from SZUL on the 20th of Dec. Then, believe it or not, I recieved shipment notice from NETAYA late on the 19th of Dec that their ring had shipped. If NETAYA had any kind of customer service department I would not own two rings now. They could have at least returned my email and let me know that the ring would be shipping, just later than expected. Their customer service is terrible and I would not advise any purchase from this company. In fact if this is the way they conduct business I would advise Amazon not to let this company drag their reputation down either. I have to say that I hold Amazon partially responsible for this by allowing them to be one of their sellers. BLUF  I would not order anything from NETAYA if you have any kind of date to meet. Very bad customer service. <end>

 B000H0KC42  Black Agate Spin Drop Silver Pendant w. Leather Necklace ||	  Nice piece  Basic but attractive piece of jewelry. Drapes nicely and looks nice dressed up or down. Stones are polished well, and silver sections look good (though not finished to the level of very high-end pieces). Overall, good purchase at this price. My wife is pleased. <end>
 B000H0R682  14k Yellow Gold Filigree Butterfly Charm ||	  Great value for price  I wasn't expecting much given the price. One doesn't get much 14K gold for $18 these days. I was pleasantly surprised with the pendant's size and sturdiness. It looks nice on a fine box chain. Well worth the money. <end>  Beautiful and worth every dime  I love this charm. Very generous size and appears to be well made. Great gift for my preteen granddaughter. <end>  Very elegant  This charm looks just like it does in the picture. It's a nice size, and being filigree, has quite a bit of detail. I would recommend! <end>
 B000H0R6D2  14k Yellow Gold Scuba Fin Charm ||	  Beach Fan  Like most of Amazon Collection this is even looking better in real life then on the picture. I got a lot of Amazon Collection Charms on a smaller chain in addition to a bigger mariner necklace chain (guess where I bought it ... of course Amazon Collection, but 2 years ago, when the gold price was lower). After I received this one I bought me another one. It has a nice weight, its made very solid and it has a nice sice. And wearing it just makes me feel I m on a vacation on a white sand bacardi beach and diving in a great blue ocean. So, buy it before its out of stock. <end>  14k Yellow Gold Scuba Fin Charm  Exactly what I expected! Haven't worn it yet but upon initial inspection it passes with flying colors. <end>
 B000H0RSKI  14k Yellow Gold Cat Charm ||	  so much cuiter in real life  Very sweet little kitty charm. Looks much better on my charm bracelet than it does in the picture above. Happy with my purchase! <end>
 B000H0T0Z4  Sterling Silver Double Open Circle Ring, Size 6 ||	  Looks like new even after 2 years  Great ring, looks like new after 2 years. It runs a little bit small though. I wear size 5 and this ring in size 5 is a little too tight. <end>  Great design but a bit uncomfortable  This is a great, trendy looking ring. The only drawback is that is fits very snug and is quite uncomfortable. I suggest ordering the next size up for comfort & correct fit. Otherwise, when you remove it at the end of the day, you'll have the imprint of the ring on your finger for several hours.I do get great compliments on this ring as it is very stylish and eye catching. I just wish it were a little more comfortable. <end>  Sterling Silver Double Open Circle Ring  I purchased this ring and it is beautiful. The information states that it is a size 7, and I usually wear a size 7 on my ring finger very easily. However this ring, felt tight on my ring finger. Other than that one small problem, its a classy and elegant looking ring. <end>  Nothing fancy but good value!  At regular cost I don't think this is worth it, but at the nicely discounted price I got this at it was definitely a good value! <end>  Very Pretty But Sized Incorrectly  This is a lovely ring but like another shopper mentioned, it is a very snug fit. I ordered this for my thumb where I usually where a size 6. The ring was extremely tight so I've opted to return it for a larger size. The original ring fit perfectly on my ring finger where I normally wear a 5.5. <end>  Perfect!  This ring is fantastic. I am a big fan of this particular design and I get compliments every time I wear it. <end>

 B000H1YAD0  Tressa Sterling Silver CZ Lined Horseshoe Necklace with 16 inch Link Chain ||	  Fake or not?  This chain has had so many compliments. I have been having it for about three months, and it has never tarnished!!

After a shipping mix-up the service department really worked hard to correct things. This seller really takes great care of the customer. The merchandise is great (after having them engraved I am wearing them now). This was a great purchasing experience. <end>  Great Service  When I received my order I noticed the tags had scratches. I contacted the seller and within a few days, they shipped me out new ones free of charge. Response time to my request was prompt. Customer service was wonderful. Highly recommend. <end>  Army mode  This product coems eactly as show. The item contains silenccers, chain, and tags. The item does not come pre-assembled, and needs to be assembled. the tags come blank and need to be engraved. the chain is not long enought ot fit over the head of an average adult. Assembly is not ahassle if one knows what to do. <end>  Dog Tags  )  These dog tags come as described no gimmicks or funny business. The only problem I had was with the silencers. The rubber can be damaged easily if it's your first time applying them other than that this is a great product for those who want to approve their style.  ) <end>  My first order  I got my dog tags on the 29 of October and I was very satisfied but the time that they got here and when I seen them I was very happy with the condention when I seen them and I will be ordering some more threw this site <end>  PERFECT  this is exactly what i wanted, everything is what it seems to be, I'd buy another if i wanted to. <end>
 B000H4716U  Martha's Engagement Ring - 3 Stone Asscher Cut CZ  Final Sale ||	  Great as a cocktail ring!  The ring is a little bigger so it isn't really an 'everyday' ring. But it is still very pretty, with a simple setting. If you really like the Asscher cut in diamonds, and can't have the real thing right now...this is a nice alternative! I got the necklace and earrings too so the set is really nice. I can wear the earrings/necklace everyday. The ring is great for an evening out. Good company, excellent customer service. <end>

She loves everything fairy. I know she wlll love this. <end>  excellent product  It is a gift for my granddaughter she will positively love it. The box is well made and has a great design. <end>  Returning this  I bought this jewelry box for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas and I will be returning it. It's very cheaply made and the music would not play for more than a few seconds. <end>  Very cute jewelry box  It is the perfect jewelry box for a little girl who loves fairies. It arrived fast and in great condition. I can't wait to give it to my daughter this christmas. <end>  Ehh...  This was shipped quickly, so that was good. I feel like it's a bit expensive for the quality. It is very pretty, however, it's obvious it's just pretty paper attached to the box. The ballerina is pretty, although, mine did not twirl correctly when I got it so I'm returning it. I'm going to attempt to physically shop for my next jewelry box. <end>  Super cute little girls' jewelry box!  I bought this jewelry box for my 3 year old daughter who is amassing a large collection of play jewelry. As of now I have it all in a random box just to keep it all together. Having had one of these jewelry boxes as a little girl, I thought my daughter should have one too. I know she will love it because it's silvery outside with pink inside and it's cute and girly and has fairies all over it. She will also get a kick out of the music and twirling dancer. The jewelry box is sturdy and very cute. I got it very securely packaged and it is in perfect condition, ready for me to wrap for Christmas. Very happy with my purchase - it was a good price too! Thank you! <end>  Schylling Iridescent Fairy Jewelry Box  I was somewhat disappointed with the jewelry box. The music box itself was terrible. You couldnt tell what song it was playing, just noise. I had to replace the music box itself with an old music box that was in my jewlery box when I was a little girl. The Fairy Jewelry Box was a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday and I didnt have time to send it back. <end>  Beautiful Piece  The box, although a bit smaller than anticipated, is crafted beautifully. The fairy's face is painted very nicely and the attention to detail is apparent in and out of the box. The music is soothing and enchanting. My 4 year-old daughter loved it... I could see her eyes light up when the fairy dances to the music.  ) <end>  Great jewelry box for little girl  I just bought this for my 2 1/2 year old who is very girly and wanted a jewelry box. It is much prettier than I expected and than it looks in the picture. I really love it, and so does she. It plays "Swan Lake" when you open the box and the fairy/ballerina turns around. I plan to get this for all of her friends for thier birthdays. <end>  great for any princess  Lovely little jewelery box for any girl (or princess) who is obsessed with anything to do with fairies! I put a number of jewellery bits inside it for her birthday. Only thing that would improve it, is maybe a few seperate compartments or ring rolls - but its no big issue. <end>  Cute jewelry box!  My Grand-daughter loves my wind up items so when I saw this I knew she would love it! She was in awe when she opened the present and as young as she is, it helps her motor skills. <end>  Adorable - just as pictured  This jewelry box is just darling. It's exactly what I pictured and seems to be of good quality. Great purchase for the price. <end>  Pretty  I ordered this jewelry box as a gift for a girl that will be turning 6. I took it out just to test it and make sure it works fine. The music worked well,it was not too loud but not too soft either. However, the swan lake tune played way too fast. I don't know if it was maybe just overwound or it was just made like that. It is different from the speed of the music of another music box we have that also plays swan lake. Anyway, other than that the box is very pretty. The top picture is beautiful, the colors are pretty. One thing that I did not like is the fact that the paper covering the box is not a perfect cutout and at the side of the box it is smaller than the box. I don't know if all boxes are like that, but it is not a big deal. It still looks good. I would recommend this box overall. <end>  jewelry box  Our 5 year old granddaughter loved the jewelry box. It is durable. The ballerina turns if the music isn't wound down and will turn in the box. If you buy it be aware of this. It isn't an issue as they usually let the music play out anyway.The box is pretty and she loved it....it even survived her two year old brother grabbing for the ballerina....great gift for her. <end>  A Great Jewelry Box  I was looking for a jewelry box for my 3 year old grand-daughter. This fairy one was so unique. After looking at many others online, this one was a very good buy and turned out to be a hit in the gift department! <end>  disappointed  Upon receiving the music box and opening it, I discovered that the mirror inside was mounted extremely crooked, so much so that I had to take it apart (which entailed cutting the material inside), realign it and glue it back together. After doing that, it was fine, but I knew what work I had done on it even though the recipient had no clue. It was very disappointing, to say the least. I'm only thankful that I didn't have it mailed directly to her because that would have been an utter disaster. <end>  Beautiful Box  Its a beautiful jewlery box. I think its overpriced, but the box was a hit at my 5 yr old nieces birthday party! All the girls loved it and my sister tells me my niece fell asleep listening to the music it played. <end>  Adorable but be warned of size.  I gave this to my daughter for her 4th bday. She loves the music and fairy and wants to sit in front of it for hours on end. It is very pretty but definitely silver in color, not blue or purple as it comes across in pictures. My only real gripe is the size, it is MUCH smaller than I realized. <end>  sweet music box  Beautiful music box with the little ballerina that dances when opened. My little girl loves this and it is a great first jewelry box. Beautiful graphics/pictures on the outside. Good value. <end>  Fairy Music Boxes  I ordered this for my twin 3 year olds...it reminds me of they ballerina one I had when I was little and they LOVE playing with the musical jewelry box now. I think the fairy music box is adorable...perfect for the little girl in your life who loves fairies and butterflies. It plays Swan Lake...very sweet. <end>  Beautiful music box  My grand daughter loved this at first sight. It seems to be very durable. She is only 16 months old and has no trouble opening and playing it for hours. <end>  jewelry box  Looks exactly like picture. Only one problem with it. The piece that starts the music box was stripped out.So I wasnt able to use the music box. I called company and they said the would exchange or refund my money. If I wanted to exchange it I had to send back and they would reimburse for the postage. To me it wasnt worth the hassle to rebox the item and take to post office to have it shipped back. I guess I would of preferred they just sent me a new one. And I could of just thrown the other away.Which In the end i did. <end>  Great Buy!  I bought this for my 4 year old niece who has been dying for a jewelry box. It is absolutely adorable & perfect size for her. The color is more silver than purplish pink but still very cute. She loved it and is now wanting more jewelry to put in it. It plays a cute tune as well. <end>  This is not a toy. It's a jewelry box.  I bought this jewelry box for my teen sister. After searching thru many "pretty" and "girly" boxes, I settled on this shiny box because its similar to the ballerina one I received on my 15th birthday. This pretty musical jewelry box is worth the tiresome search. She loved the dainty prettiness of the box and the Swan Lake song! Mind you this is a Slipknot and Avenge Sevenfold fan!!The box is made of cheap materials but it was made with great care and precision. It's a cute little jewelry box/large trinket box and the mirror, rotating fairy, and song are what I expected for the price. <end>  Exactly what I ordered.  this is exactly what I ordered. My daughter loved it. it was her favorite christmas present....she carried around everywhere for weeks! <end>  magic fairy music box!  this box is awesome and made a lovely gift for my best friend. you're never too old for a magical music box. <end>  Fun for little girls' jewelry box  My little girl was so excited to open this little jewelry box on her 3rd birthday. She had asked for a blue music ballerina jewelry box, so it was hard to find, but this fit. The outside is kind of shiny blue. <end>  Worthwhile buy!  I was happily suprised upon opening this package that I ordered for my 4 yr old niece for Christmas. I do believe that she was just as thrilled when she opened this for her present. My sister said that she cherishes it. It is absolutely beautiful! <end>  4 year old grangdaughter  Absolutely loves this jewelry box. Her sister wants one too. So I need to find something similar but unique for her <end>  Music doesn't work correctly  Beautiful box design. I was so excited to get this for my little girl. However when I spun the music handle it didn't work correctly. The music does not sound accurate and the ballerina barely moves. Disappointing! <end>  The little princess loved it  My 4 yr. old granddaughter really liked this. I heard that she plays with it and thinks it is special. <end>  My niece loves it!  I have an old music box from when I was a child and my 5-year-old niece recently took notice of it. I thought it would be better to get her one of her own since she's still small and continue the tradition. She loves watching the little fairy twirl around while she pulls out her fake jewelry to put on. It's very nice quality for a child's jewelry box. <end>  Great Kids Product!  Our granddaughter was thrilled with the Jewelry box-especially the ballerina-which fascinated her for hours. A well made product we would recommend it to any family with little girls who want to be princesses. <end>  Just what I was looking for  Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter who takes ballet lessons. She carried it around all day on Christmas. Just what I was looking for- <end>  Little girl fun!  Every little girl should have one of these at least once in life! The little fairy/ballerina spinning around to the tinny music is a memory they carry for life. This was bought for a five year old but she is probably a little young for it. My guess is this is a fantastic gift for a six to ten year old. Every time I have given one, they didn't already have one and it was a very unique gift. <end>  Great Value  This jewelry box was a really great find. It is so cute and seems very durable. The music box works perfectly and the fairy turns just right. It is the perfect first jewelry box for any young girl. <end>  Nice Jewelry Box, However has flaws  Nice jewelry box. It is a more silver than purple color. Very pretty design on the jewelry box. However, the box has a dent mark on the top that is pretty obvious, a dent in the side, not as obvious. The mirror had a nick on the side as well. The box is was packaged in was a clear light weight plastic box that had a rip on one corner. This was a gift for my niece so I had to tape the corner so I could wrap it nicely. She turned 5 and I felt this was a nice gift for her despite the flaws. If she was any older I may think twice about it. <end>  Every little girl needs one  I love this jewlery box. I bought it for my daughter because I had a similar one when I was growing up. The quality is better than I expected... very cute! <end>  Cute and perfect jewlery box  This jewelry box is too cute. It is perfect for my two granddaughters ages 4 & 5 and they love them. It is not a toy but more of a keepsake. It is made well but I don't believe that it could be handled excessively. <end>  Jewelry Box  It came fast and we were very happy with the product. My daughter plays with it every day! Thank you! <end>  So Cute  I just got this toy today and it is better than expected. I am so happy and can't wit to give it to my granddaughted. Thank you so much. <end>  Christmas Present  I had been looking for a small jewelry box for my grand daughters and had order 2 from another place. It was on back order for months and I finally had to cancel them. I placed this order through amazon.com and received them almost the next day. They are beautiful. I know my grand daughters will love them. <end>  Upset  I received this and it is broken! The doll doesn't spin right when you wind it up. I'm so disappointed. <end>  Nice but not for younger children  My daughter loved it but it soon fell apart. She was only 2 when I bought this for her and after about 3 months the doll fell off & the box began to peel. If you do buy this make sure your child is not too young and will be more gentle with it. <end>  Very pretty fairy jewelry box!!  This is a very pretty jewelry box! The iridescent colors don't come across in a picture. The little girl we got it for thought it was just beautiful. The music that played on it was clear and the dancer rotated with no problems. Great for little girls 1st jewelry box. <end>  It's cute  This is a cute jewelry box for a little girl. The quality isn't top notch (I think the inside of the one I bought is coming out a little and I've only opened the box once)but it's good enough my little flower girl. I really didn't want a shiny jewelry box but the fairy ballerina was the decision maker for me. <end>  Very pretty, Fairy doesn't spin  Ordered this as a Christmas gift for our granddaughter, and the fairy hitches and stops while spinning. Unacceptable for a little girls Christmas present. It is really a lovely box, too bad I got one that doesn't play right. I have to return this. <end>  A little girl's dream gift  Our 7 year old granddaughter has dreamed for a long time about owning just such a jewelry box as the Schylling Iridescent Fairy Jewelry Box. When she opened the box and saw the sweet ballerina and heard the delicate tingling music the huge smile and glowing face told us even before she spoke a word of delight and thanks how much she loved her gift. We'd purchased a pair of earrings to place inside, which added to the whole effect as well as reenforcing that the box was not just beautiful and fun but practical as well. We are very pleased to have chosen this gift. Thank you!Schylling Iridescent Fairy Jewelry Box <end>  Perfect!  Perfect gift for my 5 year old granddaughter who is in to fairies. The quality of this product exceeded my expectations for the price. <end>  Love it!  We ordered this and the iridescent ballerina boxes for our girls ages 4 and 5. I was very pleased when I received these in the mail - they are beautiful, seem sturdy, and the music is lovely (Swan Lake). We've had them for three months - they're packed full of jewelry, listened to and watched regularly, and they seem to be holding up with no issues. Delivery was timely. Glad we ordered them! <end>  Cute and serves it purpose  Both this for my 5 year old little girl. she loves it .. plays swan lake when you open it. detail is very nice good quality. I would recommend it for you little princesses  -) <end>  Lasted a few days  This is a really cute little jewelry box, but the dancer and latch broke in no time at all. The box is still intact so that's good. My 5-year-old daughter is very careful with her things, but after a few minutes the wings popped off the ballerina and then a little while later the whole girl came out. I was really hoping this would last longer than it did. <end>  very pretty box  This box was VERY pretty! It is more of a white iridescent...not the blue in the picture BUT yet VERY pretty. The music sounds great and the ballerina was in good working condition. My daughter (3 yrs old) absolutely LOVES the box and keeps opening and closing it. Honestly, this was a GREAT deal....good quality box for the price you are paying. It also brings back so many memories of my own musical jewellery box as a child...every little girl will love it!!! <end>

In fact, he LOVES it and has asked me before why I don't wear it too much (due to exczema). <end>

H-I, SI1-SI2. very good cut, color and clarity, the one i received is a little different from the picture; it has a six prong setting instead of four which is better IMHO, the diamond will not fall, i would like it in white gold but could not find a good quality one with my budget. As for the seller, very good product, excellent price, fast shipping, i can not complain <end>  Great Earings  They were a Valentines Day Gift. I ordered them late, but they arrived on time. My wife had new holes put in her ears last weekend just for the new studs. Although, they are small diamonds, their brilliance makes them look much bigger. <end>

 B000HDJV96  Sterling Silver Italian Puffed Anchor Chain Necklaces & Bracelets 3.4 mm Nickel Free, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Lovely chain, interesting design  I bought this along with several rolo chains, mainly out of curiousity for the style of the links. This is a slightly heavier chain at 1/8" so not the typical chain for a pendent, though it certainly would be nice with the right one. The links remind me of soda pop tops linked together. That's not to imply it's cheap looking, in fact it's very nice; just a bit different. It's a good style to wear alone, or with several chains of varying lengths together. Overall I liked it. The 4 stars are for personal taste only. I prefer the spiga and rolo chains a bit more. <end>

It was shiny and strong and exactly the right length. I love my necklace! <end>  Excellent item! Fast shipping!  I always get my sterling silver chains from Sabrina Silver -- simply the best seller -- high quality items, fast and efficient service. Always a pleasure to do business with. <end>  Awesome chain  I bought this to wear a pendant on, but it is so pretty that I've been wearing it by itself. I notice people in stores staring at it. I bought the 18", and I'm going to order more in longer lengths. Can't beat the price. <end>  Pretty but Cheap Clasp  Very pretty but the clasp breaks all the time. Their bracelets or necklaces might be better as they see a little less wear and tear than an anklet. After it broke 5 times I gave up on this. <end>  Perfect!  This is a nice medium size Singapore that looks great on the ankle! I love it. <end>

The only thing I wished that could be added to this item would be the ability to engrave the special friends' names inside the bracelet. I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and the recipient loved it. <end>
 B000HFHXXU  14 KT Yellow Gold Comfort Fit 3mm Wide Wedding / Engagement Band Ring ||	  Great fit  Very comfortable, seems to be of great quality so far. Exactly what I thought it would be. Great price. <end>  great product  quality product, exactly what i expected, would do business again <end>
 B000HG9AXA  Cubic-zirconia Rhodium Finish Sterling Silver Drop Earrings ||	  very pretty, but cheaply made  I was very pleased with the physical quality. I thought it was a great buy until I took it off my ear and one of them broke off the chain.  ( <end>
 B000HG9AXU  Cubic-zirconia Rhodium Finish Sterling Silver Chandelier Earrings ||	  cubic zirconia sterling earrings  the earrings are very pretty.however, they arrived over a week late.AND both earrings were broken.fortunately, i was able to repair them with needle-nose pliers - which probably not everyone owns a set of.so frankly, no, i would not recommend this vendor. <end>  Great Price, QUALITY item!  What can I say, both the seller of this item and the item itself screams quality. It arrived in a pillow zip bag, and it was quick shipping. The earrings were a smidge smaller than they appeared online, but still a good size. The earring clasp mechanism is a great quality also. <end>
 B000HGBN80  All-Natural Genuine 6x4 mm, Pear Shape Emerald pendant set in 14k White Gold ||	  emerald necklace  The product was delivered in a timely manner and was well packed. The item was exactly what I expected and I am happy with the product. <end>
 B000HGBPA6  All-Natural Genuine 7x5 mm, Oval Emerald pendant set in 14k White Gold ||	  ITEM WAS A GIFT. I DIDN'T SEE IT BUT.  THIS WAS A GIFT FOR JEANNE FOULKE , MY MOTHER. I UNERSTAND SHE JUST LOVED IT, SHE WAS NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING AND WAS HAPPLY SUPPRISED. IT WAS OF VERY GOOD CLEARITY AND COLOR. I HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET. <end>
 B000HGGGHI  Sterling Silver Cuff Style Engraveable Toddler Bracelet ||	  Nice Gift  I bought this for my daughter and it was a bit big for her, but she's 3. Other than that, it's very nice. We had it engraved and I'm sure she will wear it for years to come. <end>
 B000HGGGI2  Sterling Silver Ten-Strand Link Heart Theme Toggle Bracelet ||	  You're gonna lose it  The bracelet is exactly as described, and it is beautiful. However, the circle for the toggle is too large. The bracelet fell off several times before I gave up and decided returning it was a better option then losing it. <end>
 B000HGGGUA  14k White Gold Diamond Children's Cross Pendant, 15" ||	  It's pretty, but very small  This cross is very nice. The chain mine came on seemed a little flimsy though so I put the pendant on a different one.Check the size carefully to be sure it's what you want. I think the picture makes it look a little bigger than it is. If you're okay with a tiny cross, this one really is very pretty. <end>
 B000HGGGUK  14k Yellow Gold Children's Teddy Bear Pendant, 15" ||	  DO NOT BUY!!!!  Do not buy this item. I purchased this item thinking that i could give it as a gift. When this item arrived and i opened the blue suede pouch, i could not find the chain. I was about to send amazon an e mail when i decided to check the pouch again. Inside the pouch is a small pocket were the chain was hidden (and YES, this chain is so small that it was hidden well!!!!!) the pendant is about 1/4 the size of a skittles!!!(and i don't mean in thickness), and the chain is as thin as nylon thread if not thinner. You will need an magnifying glass to see this teddy bear pendant, far less to see the fur on this pendant. This is the first time i have ever rated an item 1 star, and this is by far the worst product i have ever purchased from amazon. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!! <end>
 B000HGKLYC  14k Yellow Gold Children's Heart Pendant, 15" ||	  Disappointed!  This item was a disappointment because it was much smaller and lighter than I expected. For the price I expected a more substantial chain and pendant....had it been priced appropriately, about 50% less, I would've expected what I got and would've avoided it as a gift. <end>
 B000HGMN7A  Sterling Silver Puffy Star Charm Cuff Style Bracelet ||	  Cute bracelet, but broke withing the first hour.  The bracelet is very cute; unfortunately, the charm broke off within the first hour of wear. Seller was happy to assist with an RMA, but I was happy wearing the bracelet without the charm. <end>
 B000HGMN7K  Sterling Silver Celtic Pattern Polished Cuff Bracelet ||	  Celtic pattern bracelet  My daughter received the bracelet for Christmas. She loves it. For once, dad did the right thing! <end>
 B000HGMNIE  14k Yellow Gold Children's Ladybug Earrings ||	  Worth the Price!  These were a Christmas gift for my 7-year-old niece and I was quite satisfied with the quality. However, the backs are screw-on which was not listed in the description. <end>
 B000HGMNJI  Sterling Silver Children's Locket w/ Pink/Blue Butterfly, 15" ||	  Not what i expected  I just received this locket, which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x-mas, and had to decline on giving it to her. when i received it, i actually thought Amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in. I shook the bag, felt for the necklace, and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant. it's so small, i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself. i was very disappointed. other then the size and over priced tag, i thought it was cute - but i will be returning it.sorry! <end>  sweet litlle locket  i gave this to my 10 yr old daughter for valentines day. she loves it and never takes it off. the locket is small but she managed to find two pictures in her photo album of me and her brother and cut out our faces and put them in her locket. too cute <end>
 B000HGSSNS  Sterling Silver Hoop Earrings w/ Blue Topaz ||	  Not as blue as the picture presents  Amendment to below review (Mar 07)  My wife really likes them and wears them all the time. I'd upgrade at least one more star, maybe two if I could.----------------------------------------------------------My son wanted to buy mama's present this Christmas so naturally, we turned to Amazon for computer skill training and the ability to view a lot of products easily.The earrings arrived today (very quickly) but the stone is not nearly as robust as the picture depicts. The stone is white, like a fake diamond. When viewed in other kinds of light, you can see a slight tint of blue but nothing like the picture.Another issue - the clasp or ear stud is flimsy. I may return them (need to ask my son) but I don't think these earrings will last more than a couple of wears.On the positive side - it really is a nice design. <end>  Blue is in the eyes of the beholder  Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings.In my case, I bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee. When I first received it today, I was really liked the "design" of the earring. But after closer examination, I noticed that the "blue" stone was "very light blue". Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your "own" eyes and not through fancy "photoshop" website with touchup/enhanced photos. <end>  These earrings are junk and I am ashamed I gave them for a gift.  I bought these for my wife for x-mas based on their picture. They arrived, she put them on. Both earings had the stones fall out and frame break within a half a day. They are junk and the company that sent them cannot be trusted. Be careful!!! <end>  BLUE topaz?!!!???!!!  Come on! I thought they had erroneously mailed out CZs! These earrings dont have even the faintest tinge of blue in them! What a RIP! The sterling silver was nice and well-constructed but i purchased these earrings on the strength of what i thought were the dazzling blue topaz stones. Quite a disappointment! I had to buy an emergency back-up Christmas gift for my best friend! <end>  earrings  the stones in the earrings were not at all like pictured. they look very cheap <end>  okay, but not great  The stone in these earrings was very very very pale blue, almost looked like a diamond. And they are very small. I was surprised at how small they are but that is my fault for not reading the dimensions. On the plus side, they are solid and feel like good quality. The hinged loop is easy to use. I only wish the stone was darker but other than that I liked the earrings. <end>  Perfect for second pair  I ordered these based on reviews of similar styles, despite the negative reviews here. The stone is VERY pale, it is true. However, these are well made and very comfortable and secure. I got them to wear around the clock after my starters had been in a while and they are perfect for that -- much more comfortable to sleep on than a stud back. <end>  OK looking, but VERY light stones  From other reviews,I was expecting the stones on this to be lighter than the picture. However, the stones are almost colorless, barely a hint of the stone color. Otherwise, the earrings are very nice, fasten well and are sturdy. <end>  Not Worth the Postage  I bought a couple of pair of these for my wife for "everyday" ear rings. The tiny stone fell out before she could wear one pair. The earring is so small it makes it difficult to get on. DO NOT BUY THESE. <end>
 B000HGUUHK  Sterling Silver Hoop Earrings w/ Garnet ||	  Super tiny  The earrings are cute and as depicted but tiny. They just hoop around the lobe. Pay careful attention to the size indicated. They are well made and pretty - just not what I expected (since I apparently did not pay attention). Still worth it. <end>  sterling earrings  These are very beautiful earrings. They are a little smaller than I had anticipated. The curved and rather short post make them a little difficult to put on. <end>  I want these earrings in every stone available  This is my second pair of the single stone in wide silver hoop. I love them because the width is a bit flashy yet the stone is just a touch of color. Being only a single stone, I can leave them in even if the color does not match what I have on. i think they are a good value. <end>  Earrings are more suitable for child  I purchased these earrings because I loved the design. When I received the earrings I was extremely disappointed... the earrings are much too small for an adult, they should be bought for a young child or very small adult.. too bad I really loved the concept of them but they are so small they are very hard to put on or see once they are on..the pictures of them are very misleading........learned my lesson do not buy jewelry from a picture..... <end>  For garnet girls and girls who love comfortable earrings  I LOVE these earrings! Forget about wires sticking you in the head or wire "tails" drooping below your earlobes. These earrings feature a fabulous design that ensures both a smooth, polished look and security. These earrings won't fall off your ears or irritate your ears or weigh down sensitive lobes. The earrings are light but substantial. The post locks inside the back of the hoop so you don't see it and you don't have to worry about a backstop slipping off and the earring sliding into who knows where. And the garnet! Pretty, true garnet color. Not brown or pink or muddy but clear and a lovely size. The silver stays shiny and cleans right up with mild soap and water. I bought a pair with amethysts for my sister and she loves them, too. Thought I paid a fortune for them and was so impressed. You and I know the secret - great style, great value. Great price! <end>  Tiny  Make sure you read the measurements before buying jewelry. Afriend of mine says" buying a cat in a bag' and that it true, unless you read the measurements.Mine are tiny like everyone reviewing these earring has written.I saw them as something that looked bold, but they aren'tI read they're 13 mm and that is small. I should've read this information before buying.They were just too small for me and for the price but I have a very happy niece! <end>  nice earrings  These are very nice earrings. They are a little smaller than I pictured them to be so be sure to evaluate the size before you buy. The posts are a little bit large and are sometimes hard to put on. I bought them to go with a necklace that I have and they work well for me. <end>  Purchase these only for children or teens  These earrings are as pictured but they are not meant for adults. See the other one star review from another customer, that person is correct! If your earlobes are thicker than 1/4 of an inch, the earrings will pinch and you will "feel them" when you are wearing them. My pair has hinges to open more but one hinge is stuck and does not open as much as the other. I will either return them or give them to a preteen. <end>  As pictured but Garnet not as dark  Very cute, very nice hoop earings. Again my only problem is that Garnet is a dark red stone and this was a lighter red then what was pictured. However I still give it a rating of 4. <end>  lovely every day earrings  these are nice earrings, with pretty stones. They are relatively well-made but fairly light (I have the same pair from Blue Nile and those are more 'solid' but look exactly the same on). I like this style and think the earrings make for a polished look <end>  Great Price  I bought these earings from a different company and when I saw them on Amazon they were half the price so I mailed the other ones back to the jewlery company and bought these from Amazon. Very happy about it. <end>  Garnet earrings a Christmas success  I purchased these earrings as part of my daughter's Christmas gift and she was immensely pleased to receive them. She wears them often. They are lovely and well made. <end>  Very disappointed  My wife loved the earrings. Unfortunately, the quality of the lock is very poor and one earring was lost on the first day! <end>
 B000HH6LR2  Gold plated carnelian earrings, 'Plumage' ||	  Wonderful Quality  I found these on Amazon com I wanted some earrings to match a scarab carnelian necklace and this proved a great find. Unfortunately Novica do not ship to Europe when you place and order on Amazon website so I has to use Novica own website to purchase my earrings. But I can highly recommend all the items I have purchased from Novica because the quality and originality is superb.It is also great to know that buy purchasing their jewelry you are helping crafts men and women in other parts of the world to sell their beautiful jewelry. <end>
 B000HHCQIA  Moonstone jewelry set, 'Mesmerizing' 16.1" L ||	  Gorgeous  I ordered this set because I have a moonstone ring with a pear shaped stone and this matched it beautifully! It is even prettier in person and well packaged! You could give it as a gift straight out of the box. <end>
 B000HI5CBW  Sterling Silver Italian Diamond Cut Cable Chain Necklaces & Bracelets Nickel Free, 1/8 inch wide, sizes 7 - 30 inch ||	  Great Chain.  My order came quickly and was as I expected it to be. I would definitely order from here again. <end>  Sparkling  I purchased silver chain for an anklet. I don't take it off! Comfortable light and maintains such a sparkle. As a necklace I think the chain style would look heavier than it feels...not dainty. Perfect for anklet or bracelet, and if u want to wear just the chain around ur neck....or with a med to lrge pendant. Small looped pendants wont flow over to chain. I put my tiny double happiness symbol pendant right on the clasp, which looks really cool.....like a tiffany tag. Super fast delivery. Ordered at night & recvd in one day. <end>  Three Thumbs Up  I got this in april and i really love it. it's durable but light and keeps a good shine. it's great for holding pendants <end>  Cable Sterling Chain  This item was shipped so fast I didn't even have a chance to anticipate the delivery date! Thanks $1mm!! The item was beautiful and arrive in perfect order. <end>  Silver Chain is as good as Gold!!!  This quality necklace chain was well worth the price and the service was excellent!!!! <end>
 B000HKJWM0  Sterling Silver Garnet Earrings with CZs ||	  The Garnet Earrings  The stones were smaller than appeared in the picture of them. Otherwise they are very nice. <end>
 B000HKJWRK  14K White Gold Blue Topaz Charm ||	  Merely Mediocre  The pendant is pretty, and it was inexpensive as far as jewelry goes, but when the product finally came, I was a little disappointed. The stone is skewed in the setting since the right post is thicker than the left. It's not significantly noticeable when viewed from the front though, so I didn't mind. Also, browse Netaya's website before buying through Amazon. I found a 10k version of the same pendant on sale for less. So if carats don't matter, you might find the better deal elsewhere. <end>
 B000HKV2WS  Sterling Silver Emerald Cut Amethyst Gemstone Band 10mm Ring Size 7.5 ||	  I love this ring  What you see is what you get with this ring. The color of the amethyst is a deep rich purple and the faceting is perfect. The designs on either side of the band are very pretty as well. I have received many compliments on this ring and am purchasing another ring from Gem Avenue. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I love the amethyst ring I purchased. The ring arrived when promised and is a great compliment to my amethyst earrings. I have received many compliments. When I first purchased the ring I was concerned. I have small hands, so I was worried that the ring may look too big on my hand. It looks great on. I was pleasantly surprised. I will definetly purchase from this seller again. <end>  Just Beautiful  This ring is absolutely beautiful and easy to wear. I also have heard thelittle jingle in mine, but not worried about it. It seems pretty solidanyway. If for some reason it DID fall out, I would crazy-glue it back in.This ring is that nice. <end>  mostly satisfied  Great value for the price. Stone does jingle in the setting, but seems to be secure. <end>  Gorgeous!  This ring looks exactly like the picture. Its a beautiful piece. Very high quality stone for the price. My only complaint is the amethyst seems to be a little loose in the setting and you can hear it jingling around a bit. I worry it may not hold for long. Stiil, I am very happy with this purchase! I'd definitly recommend it! <end>  I heart this ring!  Fast shipping, excellent quality! This ring is gorgeous! And b/c it's flat, I can wear gloves over it and don't have to worry about it catching on anything. I'd been searching for an amethyst & silver ring, and finally found the perfect one!!! <end>  Fabulous Ring  I love amethyst. I also need a low profile ring as I am a nurse and don't want to scratch my patients. This is the perfect ring for me. I am so impressed with the color and cut of the stone, the setting and the scroll work. I highly recommend this ring. I just may have to get a few others with different stones. I am going to order one for my daughter. Hmmm, do you think I like this ring, wrong....... I love it! <end>  loved it  I wear a lot of rings, but this one fast became a favorite--it's not just pretty and tasteful, but it's comfortable to wear, doesn't snag clothes or fabrics...the color of the stone is really pretty and the setting sets it off. <end>
 B000HKV8L8  Sterling Silver Marquise Garnet Gemstone 3mm Band Ring Size 9 ||	  NOT AS PICTURED  The ring I received from seller Gem Avenue looks like a cheap knock-off the beautiful ring in the picture. Had I received a ring looking similar to the picture I would have been satisfied. The ring I received has a metal rim around the garnet. The picture in the ad shows a ring with a prong setting, the ring I received has a cheap cracker box metal lip with a seam at the top and bottom holding the stone in place. Very disappointing after the great reviews I read. <end>  Eye Catching Ring.  I bought this for myself, since garnet is my birthstone and I love the design of the ring. It's just the right size, not too big or small, the sterling silver design looks great and is very well crafted. The stone is a nice deep garnet color, exactly what I wanted and the shape of the stone makes the ring stand out nicely. <end>  not a great buy, but I pretty good one  The ring is beautiful, the stone is a bit dark, but pretty. The band is also a bit thinner than it appeared, but fits great and looks good. For the price, it's just what you expect. <end>  Silver and Garnet Ring  Stunningly beautiful ring. I would definitely buy more items from this company. Great price, too. <end>  Beautiful ring  Love the ring. Beautiful craftmanship. Larger stone than I expected but still a great ring. <end>
 B000HKXUJQ  Sterling Silver 3mm Round Peridot Gemstone Band Ring Size 7.5 ||	  Lovely ring-well worth the purchase price!  Since receiving this ring I have rarely taken it off and I have received many compliments on it. The stones are cut cleanly and have a lot of fire in them. The trio are well balanced and have true Peridot color. The sterling setting is well crafted and looks like white karat gold. It is polished well and fits comfortably. The best find on this purchase, though was the company that offers it. Gem Avenue is prompt and the ring arrived well packaged in a cute little presentation gift box. Customer service has been great and I do plan to purchase from them again. Aloha! <end>  pretty and quick!  This ring is just as pictured, perhaps a bit more yellow in the stones. Gem Avenue is always prompt and attentive. I've bought 2 rings from them and both were just what i was looking for and matched the picture perfectly. <end>  A very lovely Peridot ring  My wife was exceptionally happy with this gift. No need to spend thousands on diamonds! <end>  A little cloudier than expected, but still a great ring!  I needed a ring to propose to my fianc&eacute;e before our anniversary. It arrived before she returned from her brother's wedding and I was able to surprise her over dinner. She loves it and it made her tear up. Thank you so much! <end>  Absolutely beautiful  I have been wanting a birthstone ring for a long time, but could never find one I liked that was reasonably priced. I finally found the perfect one! I truly love it and wear it frequently. For the price, it is absolutely gorgeous. I'm no expert on gemstones, but I don't think the average person could tell that it is not real peridot. And the polished finish is very bright and shiny. <end>  Sad  (  Stones are NOTHING like pictured, extremely cloudy/dirty & there are black "spots" in stones. Since the stones are fake, i expected MUCH better FAKE quality! I emailed. They did apoligize & asked me to mail it back for an exchange/refund. For the price, i can't see paying to mail it back w/no guarantee of recieving a better version! Very disappointed, but you do get what you pay for!" <end>
 B000HKXVKE  Sterling Silver 3mm Round Garnet Gemstone Band Ring Size 9.5 ||	  A perfect fit  This ring was just what I ordered and my friend loved it! The picture is an accurate representation of the product. I have had good success with other pieces from this seller and will gladly buy from them again and again. <end>  Great!  The service was fast and I love the ring! It's exactly what I thought it would be from the picture online. I love it. Thank you, <end>  Wonderful Ring!  I have an extensive collection of jewelry - lots of gold and silver rings with a multitude of gemstones. I was a little light in my collection with red garnets. I saw this ring online and bought it on a whim because of its low price. WOW! Was I ever surprised to receive it! The setting is a usual three stone prong setting - it arrived with the silver shiny and bright. But the three garnets! What jewels they are! Great color, wonderful clarity, and obviously high quality. I am VERY impressed - especially at the price! I am tempted to buy several and sell thm on Ebay for twice or three times what they cost at Amazon ... and I bet I would get the higher price! Really, a ring to be proud of. I am a guy and wear it as a pinkie ring. But guys, buy this for your wife-girlfriend-best friend. She will be impressed and joyous to receive it, without a doubt!! But tell her you got it at a jewelry store and paid big bucks - with the high quality of stones, she will believe you! LOL <end>  Far Exceeded my Expectation!  I recently purchased the three-stone garnet gemstone ring, and am quite pleased with my order from Gem Avenue. The ring is stunning - the stones are more attractive in person than in the picture. The sterling silver is strong, and built well. I wear it daily and receive many comments! My order came inside of a cute little box that I found it in my mailbox within a week of my purchase. I will continue to shop through Gem Avenue from the excellent service I received. You are sure to have a lovely piece of jewelry with this ring! <end>  Garnet Ring is Awesome  I love this ring! I wear it every day. I'm born in January and have a really hard time finding a garnet ring that was set in sterling (allergic to gold) that i liked. so this ring was an awesome buy for the money. <end>  A Beautiful, Sparkly Ring!!  What a fabulous ring! The size was perfect, and the garnets were so clear and sparkly...a georgous find, and this company is one I would be pleased to deal with again...what a great find at a great price! Sizing is true, and garnets are clear and well-placed in the ring. <end>  Great Garnet Ring!  I love this ring. I purchased this and the five stone garnet band ring from Gem Avenue. This ring is a deep, rich red. It looks very expensive. The silver is highly polished like white gold and substantial in weight. I highly recommend this ring. <end>  Beautiful!  This ring is absolutely beautiful and makes a great addition to my jewelry collection. I purchased it because I had been searching or a silver ring with garnet stones, which is not always the easiest combination to find. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when I found it online. Also, the classic style of the ring was a plus; it can be worn with different styles of jewelry and never seems out of place. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase and will continue to shop with Gem Avenue! <end>  nice!  Did not disappoint at all! lovely little stones catch the light and the silver was bright. a great buy! <end>  3stone garnet ring size 7.5  Th ring was more beautiful than the picture,7.5 was true to size, Garnets were more dazzling than expected <end>
 B000HL25T6  Sterling Silver Oval Cut Citrine Gemstone 3mm Band Ring Size 4.5,5,5.5,6,6.5,7,8,9 ||	  the sad truth  I love this ring! I was amazed when I first opened the box at how clean and bright the stones were. Delighted! However, it cannot be solid 925 sterling silver (even though it's stamped). I wear this ring everyday and after about the first month or so noticed that the band was beginning to wear and the color had changed. This is not a tarnish-like color change. It appears that the sterling silver coating had begun to wear down and now shows a duller, almost copper/brass-tone coming through. Now I'm afraid to even polish the ring and can't get the dust out of the stones with just a fine brush so they've become foggy.  ( I wish the company had been true to their claims of being sterling silver because I still get compliments on this ring and have seen many others that this company sells that are beautiful... but I want real sterling silver - especially when that's what I thought I bought in the first place. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  Beautiful ring. Looks even better in person. The stones are beautiful. Great price. Excellent service, fast delivery. Would use again and recommend to others. <end>
 B000HL7JOC  14 KT Yellow Gold Comfort Fit 5mm Wide Wedding / Engagement Band Ring ||	  Perfect  This is a beautiful ring. The quality is great and it's solid and thick. The way a ring should be... made to last! The ring shines. Blessed to have found such a great deal on this expensive ring. Love it. <end>
 B000HLC8TI  14 KT White Gold Comfort Fit 6mm Wide Wedding / Engagement Band Ring ||	  Exellent  I really liked the quality of the ring, and it fit perfectly on my husband. <end>
 B000HLHTHO  Top Mount Flower Trio Chain Drop Belly Ring ||	  Not the greatest  I ordered this belly ring and when i got it was surprised. A) because the top flower is much larger than i had expected, (still cute) just very gaudy... i would only wear it for a party or something. B) i was mad because it was a dud!!! it didnt work... it was Broken... it is supposed to be a top mount belly ring... it was shipped in two seperate pieces and the ball screwed onto one end and it seems like the flower should screw onto the other... but it doesnt!!! im trying to return it!! i did like the other belly ring i got from body candy tho!! the one that wasn't broken.... n e one else have a similar experience? <end>
 B000HLLUBK  14k Yellow Gold Round Filigree Pendant, 18" ||	  Graceful Lace  14k Yellow Gold Round Filigree Pendant, 18"This pendant is 1" of sparkling grace. If you want to make a statement without being overbearing this is the pendant that can do the job. For the price this pendant is very elegant. Because it is two-toned it will go well with any piece of jewelry that you want to put it with. Give it a try you'll love it! <end>  Not worth it, picture is very deceptive  The picture listed on this page could not be further from what the actual pendant looks like.I asked for this for Christmas, my loving mother, bought it for me, and when she opened it, she knew I would hate it. It looks NOTHING like the picture. The pendant is cheap and flimsy. The gold and silver colorations are not very true to the picture, it barely sparkles or has the same personality as the photo listed on this page. It's not a terrible necklace, but this is NOT what I was expecting at all. The only thing redeeming about this necklace is the chain it came on. It's pretty high quality, but it's also very thin...so it gets tangled VERY easily without you doing much of anything to it.I will be posting my own images of the pendant in the user submitted photos section, so if you don't believe me, have a look for yourself and then make up your mind. But... buyer beware. <end>  One of my favorite pieces of jewelry  I actually think it is prettier than the picture indicates. Lot of facets that look beautiful as the light hits it. The only real difference I see from the picture is that the center part tends to have more gold facets than the picture shows. One small complaint is the chain it came on is pretty thin and tends to tangle easily, but the chain is easy enough to swap out if it is that much of an issue. I love the fact it is two-tone so you can pair it up with other pieces of jewelry in silver or gold. The 1" size definitely makes a statement without being too big. It is a pretty intricate piece, so I tend to think it looks better with dressier clothing, but it looks fine with casual clothes too. Have received many compliments on it. It is very unique. <end>
 B000HM1GG8  Southwestern Style Wide Lizard Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise and Lapis Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 8, #10991 ||	  lizzard ring  Such a nice, solid, ring.

 B000HM9PF2  14g Stainless Steel Septum Retainer ||	  Bigger than expected, but otherwise great.  The jewelry is bigger than I expected, but otherwise as listed. The package says it is 1/4 inch. I'm not sure how it is supposed to be measured, but the whole thing comes closer to 1/2 inch.The form is really nice, it is easy to insert the jewelry and it is comfortable to wear flipped up or down. <end>  Much smaller then I thought.  I have been looking for a horse-shoe nose ring and I thought this was the one, but no. It is a very good retainer but it's REALLY small. I was hoping this would do the job of both a retainer and I would be able to wear it out but it doesn't. Although, my nose is huge so, it's all relative.   ) I did get the package quickly. <end>  The only septum ring I've ever liked.  I've had my fair share of septum rings, but this is the one I always come back to. It's comfortable to wear either out or flipped up inside the nose to hide during work. I always seem to forget about it when it's flipped up. I like it because it is small. Never been a fan of the actual rings or anything too clunky or big. Buy this if you like small, cute septum tidings.  ) <end>
 B000HNFRN0  Southwestern Style Horse Story Band Ring in Sterling Silver and Chip Inlay Turquoise for Men or Women, Size 8, #10824 ||	  AWESOME!!!!  Just like it is in the picture. I am so happy with this product. Bought one for myself and my mom and I'm so glad I did. Size fits perfect and comfortable too. Would recomend this ring to anyone who loves horses!!! <end>  beautiful ring  The color is very vibrant - I think the ring is stunning. The contrast between the silver and the turquoise is lovely.It's a nice weight and very comfortable. I highly recommend it. It does run a bit small though so I'd order a size up. <end>  Nice Ring!  Picked this up as a gift for Valentines day and it was loved immediately! Is that enough of a recommendation or what?!?The color of the Turquoise is just as it was pictured here at amazon the silver is as expected, brilliant and shining.Note  Inside of the ring is not totally smooth and finished. Not sure why but it's smooth to the touch, but it is pitted probably from the manufacturing process. So if you were thinking of having an inscription engraved on the inner surface that isn't going to work. <end>
 B000HNJWVI  Wide Southwestern Style Whirlwind Design Band Ring in Sterling Silver and Chip Inlay Turquoise for Men or Women, Size 12, #10827 ||	  Awesome ring!  I got this ring for my husband. It is beautiful, and he loves it. Taos Trading gives _excellent_ service, also.

I highly recommend Taos Trading and their products! <end>  turquoise&sterling silver inlaid band ring  I am very pleased with the ring. It was a gift to my husband and he loved it!! It was so easy to purchase and it arrived in plenty of time.Thank you!Sincerely,Lois Garbarini <end>

 B000HRCZTA  Solar Blue Jeweled Kimodo Dragon Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Wonderful!  I'm VERY happy with this belly ring!!! I suggest it for anyone who's thinking about getting 1 <end>
 B000HRD0QC  316l Surgical Steel Hematite Belly Ring 7/16 ||	  Not hematite  This item was not hematite. The ball ends had a shiny coating that came off within a week. I was allergic to what ever metal was underneath. It was definately not surgical steel, like the bar. Ended up with a refund because they didn't have anything genuine hematite to replace it with. Or so I was told. Was very disappointed. <end>
 B000HRF1SC  Passion Pink Top Star Quartet Belly Ring Tummy Huggy ||	  Not what it looks like  This belly ring is MUCH LARGER than I had expected, is crooked, and just not what I thought it was... It sticks out kinda far and is sort of gaudy,... Hope this helps... <end>
 B000HRF27W  Passion Pink Jeweled INITIAL Dangle Belly Ring - LETTER "M" ||	  UGGHH  i just received the M and i cant even get the ball off to put it on. it is super tight, and i am scared to keep trying because i feel it will break. what a waste of money. <end>  Don't do it!  I received this item and could not get the top ball to unscrew. In the process, the initial 'M' broke off. They quickly sent me another one. The ball screwed off easily this time but 2 days later, the 'M' fell off again. I would never purchase this product again. <end>  Tarnishing M belly ring  I thought the M was great until it start to tarnish and turn color. It was very disappointing. <end>
 B000HRF2E0  Crystalline Jeweled KIMODO DRAGON Dangle Belly Ring ||	  Nice, good for the price  It like described but the quality is not what you would call top off the line but for the price defenetly Great! <end>
 B000HTLDJG  Naruto  Chibi Kakashi Wristband ||	  Really cute!  I think it's great. Kakashi is already my favorite, and the chibi version makes him conveniently travel-sized. I like to wear this as a reminder for things  it's nice to put a note underneath! <end>  Don't buy,its all mine! LOL  I love Naruto! And so does my brother.This is my first time coming on this and WOWWWWWWWWWW! <end>

 B000HUVANE  Sterling Silver Engagement or Wedding Band Ring Set Boxed with a 6mm Brilliant Round 1.4ct White Clear CZ Cubic Zirconia Solitaire(Sizes 6,7,8,9) ||	  Wonderful  I oredered this to wear while my wedding ring was having some work done. Not only did it get to me very quickly but my husband likes it so much he wants me to wear it now instead of my other rings. All in all I would say everything was perfect  ) <end>  AWESOME!!!  I get so many compliments on my ring, and i just giggle, thinking if you only knew how much we paid for it <end>  AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My fiance bought me these rings and I just love them soooooooooooooooooooooooo much. They are way better in person then online. I was worried at first that I was not gonna like them but i really do. They are the BEST and cheap at the same time. He makes me wear them all the time. The rings also sparkle better then any diamond ring i have seen. I looked at some epensive ones and didnt like any until I saw this one. Love who ever made this ring. The ring jewels are very clear and pretty. hope the review helps. <end>  Looks like it came out of a quarter machine  I bought this ring because I wanted something I could wear all the time and not worry about losing it or damaging it. The design is a good idea and had potential but the center stone is too big and it is set in a way that makes it look like it came from a quarter machine. It has a "childs ring" look to it. It's sparkles beautifully I just don't like the way it sits. It just looks fake! They also don't fit "together" as closely as I think they should. Maybe it's just my taste, but I don't like anything about it. A lot of others think it's perfect. Just depends on what you like. <end>  Wedding Band Set  Looks better online than in person.Very disappointed with the lack of sparkle.Stones look really cloudy /fake.Did come in a very nice ring box.Should have spent a little more to get a little more. <end>
 B000HUVAQQ  Sterling Silver Irish Celtic Claddagh Link 7" Bracelet ||	  Celtic Claddagh Bracelet  This a a nice value for the money. The claddagh's and links are on the small side, not so much to my taste. However, I bought it as a gift for a very small woman. Communication and shipping are just as promised. The vendor is one you can do business with without hesitation. <end>
 B000HUX7YO  Sterling Silver Irish Celtic Claddagh Charm 9" Figaro Anklet ||	  not well made  THIS IS THE 2ND ANKLET I HAVE BOUGHT THE 1ST ONE LASTED ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND THE 2ND ONE DIDN'T LAST A DAY. I WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE NOT TO PURCHASE THIS ANKLET EVER. STERLING SILVER CELTIC CLADDAGH CHARM 9 INCH FIGARO ANKLET. <end>  not for every ankle  I can usually wear any anklet with my average size ankles and feet but I had to buy a chain exteneder to wear this. It's not quite 9" long as the description says. <end>
 B000HUZBWU  Sterling Silver Rose Quartz Heart and Red Seed Beaded 16" Choker Necklace ||	  Nice, but the heart pendant is too pale.  This is a very pretty necklace, but the pink heart pendant is very pale and did not show up well against my pale skin. The pink pendant does not go well with the red necklace. I replaced the pink pendant with a ruby red heart pendant and the necklace looks much better. I am familiar with making beaded jewelry, so I was able to replace the pendant without restringing the beads. <end>
 B000HVMZXM  18 Gauge Clear Acrylic Dome Nose Screw Retainer ||	  It's plastic.  That isn't what bothered me, though. Because the item is clearly labled as 'acrylic'. What really bothered me was the '18 gauge' label; this is not an 18 gauge. I couldn't even get it inside my piercing hole; and believe me, I tried. Hard. So hard I bled. I'd say it was a 16 gauge, at least.Body Candy Body Jewlery is usually quite decent, which is why I'm puzzled. The package arrived quickly at least. <end>  It Broke  I was so excited when I got my nose done, but when I went to put this in not only would it not bend, it broke. I don't know if it was because of the material or if being in the mail heated it to were it solidified. <end>
 B000HVN21G  18 Gauge Clear Gem BIOPLAST Nose Ring ||	  Love bioplast  I've used bioplast nose rings and nipple rings and I love them. So light and comfy!! I highly recommend bioplast body jewelry. <end>  Awesome  This is the best stud I've ever had... its very easy to take out the top part when i go to work... no one can tell i have a nose ring in at all. Then when i come home i can put it back in and bammm i have a nose ring.... I WOULD recommend this to everyone that has a nose ring! super comfortable, i don't ever feel like i have a big booger in my nose! Thanks <end>  disappointed  I got my nose pierced back in May, and found out that I have a sensitivity to medal, so when I found out that plastic works for me I ordered this, I'm sure that other customer's found this product comfortable, but for me I did not it was extremely hard to get in, from the picture I didn't realize that the top was metal I thought it was all plastic with a jewel on top. I tried it anyways thinking that okay the plastic will be inside and metal on the outside and bam...my nose had a reaction. So for those who have a metal sensitivity this is not the nose ring for you.I hope this review is helpful for those that love the look of a nose piercing, but cant do metal. <end>  Pretty!  I really like this stud - it's a nice size, pretty and sparkly without being too big or gaudy. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because Body Candy takes at least two days from the date you make your order to ship stuff (even if you order directly from their site - so it's not an Amazon issue) - but otherwise, great piece of jewelry. I also like the fact that you don't have to mess around with removing the screw to get a new look; you can just pop out the jewel and replace it with a new one of a different color/shape. Bioplast/Bioflex is by far THE most comfortable body jewelry you'll ever own. <end>  Love! Great price, great look.  This is really nice. Fits well, looks good, comfortable. Great price. Overall, super! <end>
 B000HVN22A  18 Gauge Steel Cone BIOPLAST Nose Ring ||	  Painful and Scratchy  When the nose screw came I absolutely loved how it looked! However when I tried to put it in, the end of the plastic screw was very scratchy and painful (enough to make my nose start bleeding from the tiny scrapes it gave me). I couldn't even get it in vey far without getting scraped. When I looked closer I saw that there was some scratchy plastic poking up out of the end. I even tried filing it down but it didn't help. It is such a shame because I really liked the looks of the cone but I can never actually wear it. This was my first time getting a bioplast nose screw but I think in the future I will stick to metal screws. <end>
 B000HVOZF8  Solid 14kt Yellow Gold 2mm Amethyst Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Nose Ring ||	  It won't go in  It didn't go in no matter how badly you try to screw it in, it's too small and I won't break my nose over it. Better off buying a stud. <end>
 B000HX3AQQ  Pear & Round Cut Peridot Amethyst Three-Stone Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful Little Dainty Pendant  If you like feminine jewelry, you'll really like this piece. It is small. The combination of the amethyst and peridot is quite attractive. It's beautifully designed. The stones are clear and vibrant, set in finished silver. It is smoothly finished, both front and back. Even looking at the photograph, you can clearly see how well that peridot stone is set. This jewelry is made to last for years...guarantee you, that stone will not fall out. The silver has either a rhodium or white gold plating...very nice. The silver is not icy white. Peora's amethyst is every bit as good of quality as their blue topaz, garnet, and peridot. Peora's craftsmanship is superior. This company makes quality jewelry. Even the box link chain they throw in for free, is made in Italy......They are selling quality pieces of jewelry for less than costume prices.It is actually a give away. I know jewelry, so I'm well aware of that. Believe me, I'm well on my way to "buying" up a collection of their freebies. I thank them for offering some of their jewelry online. This is a manufacturing company that sells to retailers and jewelers. Delivery is free too. It really is a give away. <end>
 B000HX3BXS  Pear Round Cut Smoky Quartz Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Great choice  Very beautiful pendant! I bought it as a gift to my Mom and she loved it! Great price, great product <end>
 B000HX58F2  Oval Cut Smoky Quartz Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  attractive piece  This is a very elegant setting. Smoky quartz tends to be too dark to reflect much light, but it's still very pretty (Peora's smoky quartz has been good quality) and looks quite nice against brown or other fall colors. <end>
 B000HX58FM  Oval Cut Amethyst Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Beautiful pendant  I am satisfied with my choose and this pendant is very delicated and beautiful. I recommend this seller Peora, the product arrived one week before the estimated.L&eacute;ia A. PavlovskySo Paulo - Brazil <end>  Pretty and Unique  I bought this necklace for my mother's birthday. She loved it. It's a unqiue design. I highly recommend it. <end>
 B000HX58J8  Round Cut Peridot Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Little Beauty  I needed an August birthstone gift and this very affordable Apple green peridot pendant was perfect! It is very well made and the silver pendant and chain are well weighted. The Peridot gemstone is beautiful and not that washed out yellowish green but a beautiful vibrant sparkly green stone. Highly recommended and have seen similar for twice as much! <end>
 B000HX58VG  Multicut Smoky Quartz & Citrine Butterfly Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Cute and fun to wear..  This is too cute and it is fun to wear. It is well made and the stones are clear and pretty. <end>
 B000HX5A14  Heart Pear Cut Garnet Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Garnet/Citrine Pendant-Peora  Nice necklace, good quality but note that the section of the necklace that hangs on the chain is large and round so it makes the gems fall over when its around your neck. This really needs a thick chain to look right.Heart Pear Cut Garnet Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver <end>
 B000HX5A8C  Trillion Cut Amethyst Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Just as pictured  This pendant has a very modern feel to it. The amethyst is clear and bright, just as in the picture. <end>
 B000HX5AA0  Radiant Cut London Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  London Blue Topaz Pendant  I was not at all happy with this purchase. The topaz is very pretty but the s.s. looks very cheap, does not look like .925, It looks as if you could have bought it from a discount store. <end>
 B000HX5BO0  Princess Cut Swiss Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  tempted to keep it  this was a bridesmaid gift, i was so tempted to keep it. i loved it. <end>
 B000HX5C3K  Round Cut Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Even better than pictured!  The product was exactly as described, and looked even better than the pictures could show! Better yet, the gift box is absolutely perfect! I will definitely shop with Peora again!Your new loyal customer,Jeremy <end>
 B000HX79VS  Round Cut Garnet Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Beautiful necklace  The necklace was a gift and the receipient loved it! It was exactly the size and color of the picture. <end>
 B000HX7A6W  Marquise Cut Amethyst Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Tarnished when I recieved it  Pendant was very pretty, but does not lay flat, it keeps turning over to the side. The biggest problem is that the chain was very badly tarnished. <end>
 B000HX7AD0  Heart Cut Garnet Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  it put lots of sparks around my neck  I never purchased jewelry in Amazon before, and this is the first time I do so. I ordered this pendant to test how reliable this particular seller is, in terms of product quality and description of the item. It turned out the pendant is as pretty as shown in the photo. The garnet gem is brilliant in red colour. There is no scratch on the surface of the stone. The silver work is fine. I love the design of the bail. Even the box chain is of good quality. I think the chain alone costs about 10 bucks in Sears or the Bay. Now the pendant and the chain are sent to my home (Ontario Canada) for only 15 bucks! I'm very pleased and satisfied. <end>
 B000HX7B5M  Round Cut Peridot Filigree Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Great value!  Free shipping was great, and very quick, too!The pendant came with a silver chain and packaged in a very pretty gift box. The peridot stone was pretty, and the silver filigree shape was shiny. It looks better than the picture on the webpage. <end>
 B000HX7BBQ  Round Cut Swiss Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  not want it looked like  hard and can't wear it, the material is hard and not easy to wear I just don't like it I should have saved my money and got on from A&E <end>
 B000HX7BI4  Radiant Cut Swiss Blue Topaz Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  PRETTY  The pendant is small in size but very pretty. The chain is also very nice, I get a lot of compliments when I wear it! <end>

 B000HX7CW4  Princess Cut Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver ||	  Great quality and low price  I bought this for my little sister for Christmas. She had her first baby November 3rd, so I thought it would be neat to give her his birthstone. I was hesitant about what the quality would be like at such a low price, but boy was I surprised! The little purple box was cute, shipping was extreamly quick, and the necklace is adorable. I am extreamly pleased especially because she loves it and wears it everyday!! I have since purchased 3 more necklaces for family and friends, everyone loves the gemstones!! <end>
 B000HX82DM  Round Cut Garnet Three Stone Pendant Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Good purchase  I ordered one of these three garnet pendants for my mom at Christmas time. The order shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected. Correction, this product was better than I expected! Now I always check Peora when I am considering a similar purchase, I would use them again. <end>
 B000HXM2IS  Impressive Eagle Globe & Anchor 10 KT Yellow Gold Pendant 10K Charm ||	  Love this  I bought this for my husband (he is an ex-Marine, his son is in the Marine Corps) along with a men's chain. He's had it now for about two years, and it still looks as beautiful as the day he got it. I think he's taken it off once since he got it. It is a good size, not too big and not too small. The detail is very striking and has remained true through daily wear (seriously, looks like the day we got it). He loves it, and I'm extremely pleased with the quality and craftsmanship. <end>  Great Service  I was very happy with this company's service and the item I bought and I received it 2 days before Christmas My husband was very surprised and happy. He is a former Marine and has always wanted this Marine charm.Thank you for making his Christmas.GertSO HAVEN,MI <end>  Very nice  This is a beautiful piece of jewlery and well made. It is also the perfect size for a man to wear on a heavy chain, very nice. <end>
 B000HZD0JG  German 1 Mark "Eagle" Two Tone Gold Filled Rope Bezel Coin Pendant with 18" Chain ||	  Mixed feeling about it.  I received this coin pendant the other day. There are some things you should know about it. The 18 inch chain is worthless. The clasp is so small you can't use it. That's the first thing to go in the trash. The cheap plastic box marked "made in China" was the second thing to go in the trash. My titanium necklace is 5 mm wide. That small triangular "thing" that attaches the pendant to the chain was way too small for my necklace, so that was the third thing to go in the trash. I found a keyring that was on an other object. It is only about the diameter of a pencil. This worked great for attaching the pendant to my necklace.Now, as for the pendant itself. It is about the size of a quarter but not as thick as a quarter. Its thickness is about that of a dime. The relief of the figures is very shallow. On the back side it has the number 1 with twin oak leaves on both sides of the 1. Underneath that is "deutsche". Under that is "mark". Under that is the year it was made. Mine is stamped 1950 which I like because that was the year I was born. The so called hard protective coating they talk about is on the front only. The back of the coin does not have it. Simple nail polish solved that problem.Overall, I like it but I don't think it is worth a hundred bucks. <end>  great  I have had a 18 karat gold chain for years and have been looking for a pendant to wear with it. I'm a guy 64 years young and have searched for a long time for something that didn't look cheesy or like a goodfella. I'm from Germany and this is really cool. Like the description says it is a lot brighter then the picture. On the back it has the date of the coin. If you want something authentic and really great looking look no further this is it. <end>
 B000HZD0YQ  Irish Penny "Pig and Piglets" Two Tone Coin Pendant with 18" Chain ||	  PIG COIN PENDANT FROM IRELAND  This pendant is very pretty and I've received lots of complements. It's unusual and unique and very well done. <end>

 B000I0M1VI  Designer Mesh Black Catseye-style Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Good Online Store  Good Items Just Needs Some Work On The Details/Description Overall I Recommend Using The Site/App For Your Next Purchase You Might Save Time And Money <end>
 B000I0M2XU  Unforgettable Charcoal Gray Catseye-style Cufflinks Framed silver-tone by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Unforgettable cuff links  I was disappointed that the actual vs. online photo was not attractive. Shipping was very timely and the nice packaging prevented any transit damage. Vendor has a very large selection. The shipping fee assessed at the point of purchase was equal to a fourth of the price of the product at my price point and there is no free shipping on returns. The customer service rep was defensive when I shared my disappointment. A refund was promptly received. I am not interested in reordering. <end>
 B000I0PFAC  Elegant Navy Blue Catseye-style Cufflinks ||	  Beautiful and reasonable  These are beautiful cufflinks. I've gotten several from cuff-daddy and my husband has liked all of them. Most are packaged really nicely too (though I don't specifically remember how these were packaged). These are a great value. <end>  Blue cuff links  I bought this as a Christmas present for my boss. They are very nice and can be worn with black, blue, or grey shirts and jackets. Very good quality. <end>
 B000I0PFUC  Rich 2-Tone Blue Catseye-style Cufflinks Framed silver-tone by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Great product.  I ordered this pair and another pair from Cuff Daddy, they came at the same time very quickly. This pair is actually nicer looking in person. They come in a small case at no extra charge which is really nice. I think my fiance will really like them. I got the cufflinks for him as a Christmas gift. <end>
 B000I0SZLS  Chic Charcoal Gray Round Cufflinks with Carbon Fiber ||	  Love them!!

 B000I0SZPY  Classic Silver Tone Barbell Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  PLEASANTLY SURPRISED  This set will comfortably sit side-by-side with links sold at high-end retailers (that sell for - seriously - 20 times more).Product exactly as pictured/represented.

 B000I0VM4K  Sterling Silver Flower Pendant With Amethyst by Zina, 18" ||	  Okay pendant  This is an okay pendant. The stone is rather small. It might help to look at pendant size measurements if given, before buying. Yet I must say that it is a classy shape and I often end up wearing this over T-shirts for a casual look. <end>  Great Product! Beautiful Packaging!  I ordered this necklace for my mom and it is absolutely beautiful! The pretty box it came in and the excellent packaging shows the care given by this company. It is a dainty flower with a very pretty stone. I recommend this necklace for those who like a smaller pendant with a classy touch. Very nice! <end>
 B000I0XPNG  Sterling Silver Infinity Hearts Necklace ||	  Good  Great necklace for the price! Looks better than I thought and my girlfriend loves it! Great buy,Recommend this necklace if your wanting it!! Thanks. <end>  Beautiful  This was a gift from my husband, and it's perfect. It sits beautifully when it's on, I could not be happier with this! <end>  Very Nice  Exactly what I expected when I received my product. Cept, it's a little smaller. Size doesnt really matter though because it looks great around my girlfriends neck. Shipping was fast and I would defiantly order from them again. <end>  Satisfied  great deal, the chain is a bit short for my liking but I'm still satisfied and wearing it. Thats all I have to say, but amazon is making me use at least 20 words... Thanks. <end>
 B000I0YYO0  Sterling Silver Flower Pendant With Garnet by Zina, 18" ||	  Wish this had a better clasp.  Zina makes wonderful jewelry and that is why I am frustrated that they use such a cheap chain for this pendant. The pendant itself is beautiful and the silver SHINES, but the garnet is very small. It is a nice red color though. I purchased this on sale and that is why it gets four stars and not three. <end>
 B000I3P5ZE  Pugster Inspired Red Green Leaf Apple Detailed Swarovski Crystal Diamond Accent Brooches And Pins For Holiday Gifts ||	  Lovely  Lovely, fun costume brooch. Every girl needs some fun accessories and this is a great one to pin on a scarf or sweater or whatever. It has nice colors and is not too big or too small. The clasp is well-made and Pugster gave quick delivery. Good value for the money. <end>
 B000I5TQS4  Green Crystal Set Flower Shaped Chandelier Earrings with Cascading Shell Disc Drops ||	  Charming chandelier  Love the greens in these earrings. Folks always compliment me on them. The weight is fine. Great price. <end>
 B000I5Z7MI  Caribbean Blue Crackled Glass Drops - 2" Long Beaded CZ Post Earrings ||	  Bought as a filler, now a favorite!  I bought these while there was a special deal with the company selling it for free shipping of orders that were $75+. I needed an item to push me over the threshold, so I settled on this - and I am so glad I did! The blue crackled glass sparkled and catches the light, almost at times looking like it has a light within it. It's the exact color pictured - a soft teal that reminds me, like the name suggests, of the crystalline ocean in the Caribbean or Hawaii. It's light enough and reflects other colors in the cracks well enough that I can wear these with a pale blue or a deep turquoise or peacock, and it looks like they're a perfect match to either.I do think I would prefer a silver ball at the top instead of the cubic zirconium, and I would like it if the chain was a bit nicer looking than the ball style. However, those are minor compared to the beauty of the crackled stone, so no complaints here! I've only had these for a day, and I already have received several compliments.Additionally, Silver Insanity - the vendor - was a pleasure to deal with, and I received a personal email from them about shipping before Amazon emailed me to let me know it had shipped. Some companies don't bother with contacting you unless there's a problem, so it was a nice touch. These arrived more quickly than I expected, packaged in a small box with my other earrings. Each pair was in a small plastic bag, and I loved them all! <end>
 B000I62T9Q  Jeweled Light Purple Turtle Trinket Box ||	  a winner  The quality is very high; a beautiful turtle tinket which even comes in a lovely box a la Tiffany's. I'd buy it again and give it as a gift. <end>
 B000I64S90  14k Yellow Shiny Edged Slip-on Bangle Bracelet - 8 Inch - JewelryWeb ||	  Wish I could give it no stars  These bracelets are so flimsy, skinny that they bend before you can even put them on. At first it seemed like good value, but they are not worth even $200.00 that I paid for each. Spend more to get something that doesn't collapse. <end>
 B000I6ORM8  Men's Titanium Cross Pendant, 20" ||	  FYI  FYI, Titanium is a LIGHTWEIGHT, extremely durable metal. If you want pretty and shiny, splurge on some white gold, and skip this item. I love it personally, and my construction engineer boyfriend does too. This necklace is perfect for active men. <end>  Wonderful --- great product  I bought this for my husband for our anniversary. He loves it and I do too. I bought it to match his titanium wedding band. He is an engineer so titanium is a great metal for him it is so strong, durable and wont bend. I guess the people on here that have given this a bad review really should blame themselves for not finding out what titanium was about first. It is a very lightweight metal but, it is so strong. Don't blame the product because it is very good and exatley as described. And it is avery very nice necklace and cross. <end>  LOVE IT!  I couldn't be happier with this. Its industrial design looks every bit as good in person as it does on the computer screen. And you can't beat the price, considering I've seen the same exact item elsewhere for $150. <end>  Husband thinks its great  As others have mentioned, this is very light weight - my understanding is that this is the nature of titanium. I bought this for my husband for Christmas last year and he really likes it. My boys said if he didn't like it, they would take it so when I noticed the price dropped I purchased another one for one of our sons.If you are looking for something bright and shiny and lots of "bling" as someone mentioned, this may not be for you. However, if you are looking for a nice simple masculine cross and chain for a man I think this is a great choice. <end>  Very nice cross  I bought my husband a titanium wedding band for Valentines Day and I wanted to find a cross and necklace to match. I gave this to him for our Wedding anniversary and he loves it. It is very nice and sturdy with a ver masculine look. <end>  Very disappointed  Bought this for our 20 year old son for x-mas. I was very disappointed with the quality of this $85 pendant and returned it the very next day. The chain looked and felt like plastic. My initial reaction when I took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine.Went to a Christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for $28 that was 1,000 times better than this $85 one. <end>  Cheap Looking  I really thought this necklace looked good in the picture, and then I recieved it today wow! it is so light and the quality of the chain is terrible. I have bought this for my boy friend for Christmas and now im wondering whether to even give it to him. It should cost 20 bucks maybe. <end>  Sheri/Mike's Review  The gift was for my 12yr old son and he prefers to have a watch. Is there anyway I can return itemm, get a credit for it, and then purchase one of your men's watches. He likes things more "bling-bling". <end>
 B000I7ON8U  Tressa Sterling Silver Small Heart Earrings with Accent CZ Stones ||	  Earings.  I bought earings from this user and they were here within 3 or 4 days. Very fast delivery. Also they looked even better than I thought. I would def. buy from this user again. <end>
 B000I7ONCG  Tressa Sterling Silver CZ Accented Dragonfly Dangle Earrings ||	  silver dragonfly earrings  My daughter loves dragonflies. When she opened the boxcontaining the earrings, she was tickled! She lovesdangly earrings, so these were a perfect match for her! <end>  Pretty  I really like these earrings! Pretty and delicate, they're very lightweight - you feel like you're not wearing anything at all. Only problem is they irritate my sensitive ears... they must only be sterling plated, because pure sterling has never given me a problem before. <end>
 B000I7ONNA  Sterling Silver Polished Stars Dangle Earrings ||	  Beautiful & inexpensive  We ordered these earrings for Bridesmaid gifts. There will be a lot of stars at the wedding and will have the wedding party wear the earrings. <end>
 B000I7P596  Sterling Silver Chunky Link Dragonfly Bracelet ||	  Sad  I purchased this item and it was as beautiful as it looked in online when I received it. However after a week of wearing it the dragonfly fell off somewhere so there was not point in wearing it anymore. It was great for the price, but I was disappointed that I was unable to enjoy it very long. <end>
 B000I7QHG6  Sterling Silver Squared Pendant with Pink Center Stone with Chain ||	  Beautiful Pendant  This is a stunning piece of jewelry, at a terrific price. The length is perfect for wearing with a v-neck top. I've gotten many compliments on this necklace. <end>
 B000I7RXIC  Tressa Sterling Silver Four Leaf Clover CZ Necklace with Chain ||	  Four Leaf Clover CZ Necklace  Ordering was easy and the item arrived unbelievable fast. The necklace was very nice looking and the quality seems to be really good. I bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it and hasn't taken it off. <end>  Silver Four Leaf Clover  It was just what I expected it to be. It was simple and yet beautiful. It arrived within two weeks before Christmas, just like they said it would. <end>
 B000I82WJ6  36-Compartment Jewelry Organizer for Earring Storage ||	  Great jewelry organizer  I love this jewelry organizer. It has lots of varied size compartments, with a velveteen interior finish, so as not to scratch anything. It keeps my earrings separated and easy to find. It fits in my drawer and has a clear plastic cover that is easy to lift out of the way. I can see all my earrings and find the ones I want very easily. The price is reasonable and shipping was fast! I may get another one to put on top of the first one to keep more earrings organized. The best thing about this item is that it is in a drawer..out of sight and protected from dust.JEWELRY 36 COMPARTMENT ORGANIZER <end>  Jewelry organizer  Just as promised, very nice product -- although plastic-y. Prompt delivery, would buy from them again. <end>  Jewelry Organizer  This organizer is PERFECT - a perfect fit for the drawer space I have, perfect size dividers for pendants, earrings, etc. and helps keep things in order! LOVE IT. The quality is what I expected for the price - it should hold up well for several years. <end>  Cheap plastic item  This case is disappointing. It is cheap plastic. The container does not even have a real lid that fastens. It is just a sheet of packaging plastic that you lift off. Way overpriced. <end>  Perfect earring holder  This fits into my bathroom top drawer perfectly. Pull it open... and there are all my earrings easily accessible. I love this jewelry organizer!!! <end>  Wish I would have found this before!  I have had a jewelry armoire that i bought from QVC that looked good with my furniture, but didn't protect the jewelry from dust and tarnish as it was supposed tolThese trays take up less space, and protect the items. I can see at a glance what I need and don't have to worry about earrings, etc falling off the bars.Wish I would have found this before I spent the $300 for the armoire!!! <end>  Love IT!  just what I needed - now all my pierced earrings are easy to find - and are always in pairs! <end>  very handy jewelry container  I needed something to keep all my earrings in so I could see at a glance what I wanted. This is just perfect. It fits in my drawer perfectly. <end>
 B000I8J3XY  New Glamarous Carnelian Gemstone & Clear Swarovski Crystal Genuine.925 Sterling Silver Leverback Dangle Earrings ||	  Carnelian earrings  These earrings were a disappointment to me. Colors were off a little and one stone is slightly chipped and the sizes of the square stone are different. I've bought several other items and this is the only one that disappointmented me. <end>
 B000I8L4E0  Sterling Silver Oval Green Jade Greek Key 25mm x 19mm 1 inch Long Dangle Pendant ||	  A little disappointed  I purchased this for my wife, she seems to be happy with it but I am disappointed. The Silver looks like its plastic and the jade isnt far off. I am not a jewlery expert so maybe I am wrong but I dont like it. <end>  Green Jade Pendant  Although it was smaller then I assumed, it is absolutely beautiful and arrived pretty quickly, nicely packaged and a great value <end>
 B000IAYUNA  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Clear Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Rhodium Plated 13mm Mens Ring Size 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 ||	  9.25 RING STERLING SILVER BAND CUBIC ZIRCONIA  STONE FELL OUT AFTER I BOUGHT IT WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF NORMAL WEAR/CAN'T WEAR IT NOW/DISAPPOINTMENT BEYOND BELIEF!!!!! <end>  A fantastic product  When I recieved my ring i didn't imagine that it was such a fine piece of art, I was impressed with its quality and fine design, so I advice all the interested in this kind of product to buy at amazon.com because only here you can finde a great shipping servive and huge quality in all their stuff. <end>  cubic zirconia ring  very nice looking ring, could be a little brighter, but for the price it looks very nice.kr <end>  wow what a ring!!!  This the ring and I saw it in gold and diamonds but you know what Now that I see it in silver I had to buy it and yes I love it. I will only use it to go out .This is one ring for my collection. and the price is amazing I will say this you wont regret it..Its Beautiful. Buy it you love it.. <end>  Small stones/little sparkle  Ring arrived after three days, does not state caret size. stone very small no light refraction, seems small and dull. design is good, stones unremarkable, reflect very little light <end>
 B000IB4GO2  Nickel Free Tarnish Free .925 Silver Clear Round Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Rhodium Plated 5mm Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  nice, but not to believable  This was too big and flashy for me. The center stone is big...nice if you have that kind of taste, but I like something a little more understated so that it can be believable. <end>  Beautiful Ring  Based on the many positive reviews for this ring, I expected it would be very good-looking. But when it arrived and I set eyes on it, I was actually kind of shocked how beautiful it was! The cz's sparkle so brightly, the facets glitter brilliantly. It looks natural and great to wear. The large stone is substantial, but not overly large; it is a classic size. The second, multi-stone band complements the first band perfectly. It is simply a beautiful ring. <end>  Very nice!!!!  Very nice product, good quality, very shiny and can even look better than those real ones that cost thousands of dollars!! Love how it looks... I recommend this if you want something very good looking for very low price... <end>  IT'S SOOOO REAL!!!  I got this ring 2 days after xmas. I opened the little box, only to find a GEORGEOUS surprise!! I use these rings as my new wedding set..It is absolutely stunning and the best part is, nobody knows it's not real..I get a huge amount of compliments. It's not turning my fingers green and it looks like white gold!! I'm very impressed. All my friends are super jealous!! Thanks AMAZON!! <end>  I love love love this ring  It fit perfectly on my finger. It's so beautiful, I can't stop starring at it. It came really fast in the mail and it is everything it said it would be. <end>  Disappointed with ring, but not with company  I was a little disappointed when I recieved this ring. It does not look like it does in the pictures. The stones around the base of the center stone are way smaller than what they appear in the picture. Some of the stones were crooked and the settings bent. It looked fake and poorly crafted. The company was very nice about replacing the ring. I decided to go with the 1/2 carat princess cut ring. I recieved it very quickly and was extremely happy with it. Much better quality and easily passes as the real deal. <end>  Tiny prongs  I ordered two CZ wedding ring sets and this one is by far the better of the two. The main CZ is very pretty and has a lot of fire, but the band is poorly crafted and does not look as nice as the encrusted CZ's around the solitaire. The four prongs on the solitaire are dinky, giving it more of a phony feel, considering the main CZ is large and would require a more hardy prong setting (if it was genuine). Time will tell if the rodium plating holds up but overall it does look like white gold. I am a fine jewelry fan so I may be just a bit nit picky considering the price and materials. Overall not a bad ring for the price. <end>  Cute!  I recieved this ring about a month ago, I had got the wrong size at first lol but they were nice enough to let me exchange it. Its original and I get SOOOO many ppl saying you so lucky and that its really beautiful, You really cant even tell that its fake. My fiancee doesnt really like me wearing it to much because ppl might notice that its fake, but you be suprised how many ppl like it!!! <end>  good  ring was not all that great. middle stone is a nice size but the ring did not match up to the picture to me. Overall was a nice ring. <end>  Very pretty but don't wear in a pool  I really like this set. I am using it while I am pregnant as my real set does not fit. It was great until I wore it in the pool, now the silver looks like it is cracked and going to fall off. It was great before that, no complaints. I even wore it in the shower everyday with no problems. I am going to order another one, a bigger size as I just keep getting bigger but I won't wear it in the pool this time! It looks very nice for the price. <end>  Excellent choice  . My husband made me a present for our anniversary and I really liked this ring it's very cute. I like brilliant cut and 1ct is perfect for me. If you look the picture it's a bit smaller in real. For my taste it's perfect.Very shiny. Very good purchase. <end>  I love this set  I love the set. I own all gold diamond jewelry and like to wear white gold/silver when other accessories so I purchased this set with low expectations. I was amazed. I get compliments often. It is not gauty and fake looking. The price is a steal for the quality. I would not hesitate to purchase from this company in the future. Excellent product. <end>  Brilliant  This is the second time I have purchased from Gem Ave and I am very pleased with both the Ring and the sellers service. It has been my pleasure doing business with this seller. All is Awesome.Season Warmest Greetings. Thank you. <end>  Nice ring  I got this set as an engagement/wedding ring, my fiancee and I are low on cash and after research decided to go with cz. The stone is beautiful and noone knows it's not real, I've received many compliments. The pave style setting on the band and collar is not as impressive as it appears in the pictures but is definitely adequate and probably makes it more realistic. The metal did tarnish almost immediately from the rings rubbing together but noone looks that closely at it and for the price it's hard to complain. After about four months of it wearing nonstop I've decided to order an engraved band but this is due to having a very hands-on job with heavy lifting and moving product and it gets in the way, not due to any problem.Prospective buyers should be aware, however, that this is sterling silver and it will get bent and scratched and lose it's shine. Definitely not a "forever" ring. More of a "for the next few years until we can afford better" ring. A plus though is that I can afford to try out this and other styles without the financial commitment or any guilt. Over all I consider this a great purchase and am very happy with it. Would definitely buy again. <end>  Beautiful Rings!  The rings are beautiful! Not cheap looking at all!!! I would definetly recomend to someone who was looking for their rings! It's a good buy for sure. <end>
 B000IB75PO  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Emerald cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Polished Finish Rhodium Plated 4mm Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  As somebody else said  The ring was in great condition. It looks cheap if you can look from the inner side of the ring, but while wearing it nobody will notice. As somebody else said, unless they are looking closely nobody will notice and if they are that close that's weird.edit It's been awhile since my girl friend has worn it and it still looks good, and she really like it. <end>  Very Shiny  I bought this ring and was really impressed. It is very shiny, always new looking. If you keep it cleaned with silver jewelry wipes or cloths it stays like brand new. I have had alot of compliments and I wear this ring on a daily basis. From first glance you will think it is real diamonds. If someone is that close to my fingers and says its not -THEY NEED TO MOVE BACK. Guaranteed to impress. I would highly recommend to friends and family. <end>  silver ring  Looks like a majorly expensive ring! My girlfriends noticed it immediately and thought I had splurged on diamonds! <end>  present for my daughter  My daughter entered the univercity, and i was looking for a present for her. I think this ring was a wanderfull precent for her. She liked it very much. <end>  inexpensive and fun  At the prices offered through amazon via GEM avenue, you can really have fun accessorizing your wardrobe. Good quality for the money and if you lose or misplace it, it's kind of no big deal. I just enjoy having a variety of fun stuff to perk up my mood. My girls think it's fun too.... You won't really fool anybody with a good eye, but WHO CARES, it just should be fun! Cute ring. FUN. <end>
 B000IBFU10  Sterling Silver Girl March Birthstone Necklace with Rolo Chain ||	  its good for a b day present  It's a good and low priced present.my mom loved it. She wears it everywhere. She always brags about it when I'm around. I recommend this to anyone who has a colorful mom <end>
 B000IBL3LG  Sterling Silver Garnet Colored CZ January Birthstone Pendant with Snake Chain ||	  poorly made product  lost a stone on the first day and the chain broke a few days after that. very disappointed. <end>
 B000IBT0AM  Round Cut Peridot Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Gorgeous earrings!  I must have looked at 500 pairs of peridot earrings set in sterling silver before I ordered these. From the picture, I wasn't sure how big or long they would be, but when they came today and I tried them on, they were perfect! (I have small features, and the earrings' size isn't at all overwhelming. The stone setting part hangs about a quarter inch below my earlobes.) The stones are a deep shade of green, not too yellowish, and the backs fit on the posts snugly so I won't have to worry about losing one. They came in an elegant black box with a black bow on the top--a beautiful presentation for a gift. <end>
 B000IBT0LG  Multicut Amethyst Citrine Peridot Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Dainty/colorful dangles  These earrings are so very pretty. They are rather unusual with gem stones set in such a dainty dangle style. LOVE THEM. <end>
 B000IBUNVM  Round Cut Amethyst Drop Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Beautiful! Fast Shipping!  I bought these earrings as a gift for my mom. When they showed up within days they are more beautiful than the photo. Super shiny silver and beautiful amethyst. Great as a gift or yourself. Elegant yet dainty. <end>  It's cute but not for adults  It's cute for a teen or younger but way small for an adult ears. I paid $10 and that's about what it is worth. <end>  Nice quality and good value  I got 3 pairs to send as gifts and they were a great value, very high quality in all aspects, a little smaller than I had envisioned, but very satisfied. They also came with an adorable gift box! <end>  Love Peoria  This is the second item I've purchased from Peoria. Both have been gold box purchases, and both have come very quickly. I love the look of these earrings. They are small, so they're perfect for my niece who is still quite young.They come packaged inside a plastic bag, which is not lazy or cheap, but prevents the silver from tarnishing. The actual gift box is lovely  purple with a purple bow and flowers on one corner. I'm very pleased and plan to purchase from them again. <end>
 B000IBUP10  Oval Cut Moonstone Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Delicate and beautiful  I love the moonstones and filigree look of this pair of earrings. The only problem I have with it is the ear-wire. It looks clunky next to the dangle. I plan to buy different earwires and change them out. <end>
 B000IBUWKO  Oval Cut Opal Bead Bali Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Huge Disappointment  I suppose I should have known better given the very low price of this ring, but I was still surprised when I opened the package only to find a ring that looks like something you would get out of a gumball machine.I admit that I am no expert on jewelry, and thus it is possible I am incorrect in my displeasure, but to me the entire product, from the band to the "opal" (and I use the term loosely) looked like cheap plastic. I would under no circumstances recommend this product to anyone. <end>
 B000IBUWQ8  Princess Cut Peridot Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Not sterling silver, and NOT resizeable!  The ring came only a couple of days after I ordered it, and it was just as pretty as the picture makes it look-- but when I took it to a jewelry repair shop to have it sized down to fit me, they discovered that the ring is only plated in sterling silver and that the inner metal is not resizeable. It destroyed the ring. I was very disappointed because it was beautiful and the company's website swears that they use only genuine metals and gems... short story, they lied. <end>  Purchase this Item!  This was definitely a great purchase. I love it. It has a very smooth setting and it is unique because of the setting. I wear it very often. The peridot has great color and the size is very comfortable. Definitely consider this item! <end>  This Ring Is Gorgeous!!  If you think this ring looks pretty in the picture just wait until you see it in person! I fell in love with it when I saw it and it has become my favorite birthstone ring. Even the box it came in was pretty! It's very feminine and the stone as well as the setting and band really glimmer, I can't stop looking at it when I wear it! I read in another review before I bought this ring that the stone was loose in their setting so this was the first thing I checked and was pleased to find that it was well set and didn't move at all, and I've even knocked it against the wall a couple of times and it hasn't loosened in the slightest. I'm very happy with this ring and have another from this seller already in my wish list! <end>
 B000IBUX6M  Round Cut Garnet Ring Sterling Silver Size 7 ||	  Very Satisfied  Was exactly what I ordered & was beautiful. Recieved it very quickly -got it just in time for Christmas. I was/am very pleased. <end>
 B000IBUXB2  Princess Cut Pink Cz Ring Sterling Silver Size 8 ||	  Daughter Gift  My daughter wears it every day and loves it, my only complaint is that is has started to turn a little <end>
 B000IBUXLW  Princess Cut Smoky Quartz Ring Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Size 9 ||	  love it!  I absolutely love this ring! the sizes from this seller run larger than I am used to but I simply switched it to another finger other than the one I ordered it for and I really like the change! beautiful ring! <end>
 B000IBUXOE  Bali Style Eternity Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Its very nice, but...  its a very nice ring, with a great meaning. it's like a promise ring for your girlfriend/fiance/wife... i just hope it fits my girlfriend because it only comes in size 6. <end>
 B000IBUXU8  Round Cut Pink Cz Toe/Pinky Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Made to last  I purchased this pinky ring during Black Friday on a whim, and three years later, I still love it.The form is flattering to an overly thin finger, and I'm able to bend it to adjust the width if need be. The pink stones are shiny without being tacky, and the ring has gone through much wear and tear without any major damage. When you're as klutzy as I am, that's saying a lot!This is a great product, and I'd definitely consider more from the same jeweler. <end>
 B000IBVQAE  Oval Cut Tigereye Dangling Heart Earrings Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Perfect Fall Earings!  Peora makes well-made jewlery. I just recieved these today and they are just as described and perfect for fall, thank you! <end>
 B000IBVQJ0  Heart Pear Cut Peridot Swiss Blue Topaz Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Gorgeous  These earrings are absolutely beautiful. Peora packaged them well, and presented them in a nice gift box. I will definitely make a point of buying from them again. ITs one of the few times I've actually received more than I expected. <end>
 B000IBVY9C  Oval Cut London Blue Topaz Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Pretty Blue Topaz!  I am really pleased with the quality of this ring. The stone is a good size and clear and rich in its blue topaz color. The construction seems sound - no seams or rough spots, which is a great sign for an inexpensive ring. I like the way the ring feels on my finger - smooth, just right in weight and it doesn't snag sweaters or hose. The stone is set inside the metal housing (I know there are technical terms but I'm not a jeweler!) so there are no prongs, little chance for the stone to get loose. All in all, this is a good ring especially for someone like me who doesn't have large hands. If you have large hands, this might look small on your ring finger but it's perfect for smaller hands. <end>
 B000IBVYIS  Princess Cut Peridot Solitaire Ring Sterling Silver ||	  wrong item sent; defective item, nothing to review it with  i did not get the right item i ordered. in addition to being the wrong item, the ring was bent and defective when it arrived. i contacted the seller through amazon and i got a full refund for the item within a matter of hours. amazon and the seller have both excellent customer service. but, i am disappointed that i did not get the ring i wanted/ordered. i checked on the website and it says, unavailable. pity! <end>
 B000IBVYKG  Round Cut Peridot Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Peridot Ring  This fit my pinky finger perfectly which is what I wanted. The gem is clear and clean. If it clouds up baking soda or toothpaste cleans it up. I really like this ring. <end>
 B000IBVYLU  Round Cut Amethyst Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Cute Amethyst Ring...very attractive  I am really happy that I ordered this ring. The quality of this ring is very high for the price. It is very attractive and will be worn a lot. <end>
 B000IBVZWI  Radiant Cut Garnet Ring Sterling SIlver ||	  Very disappointed  I ordered this for me niece's 16th Birthday. It came in a small box in a "bubble" envelope. The stone is loose, there was no tag on the ring and it cannot be exchanged as Peora has no more. Think twice before buying from this company.Sincerely,ari <end>
 B000IBW0BS  Round Cut London Blue Topaz Peridot Citrine Three Stone Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Love this!!!!  I ordered this as a mother/children ring. It has the birthstones of my two children and my own birthstone, therefore it was perfect! It is the perfect size, not to big an gawdy, and not so tiny that you can't make out the stones.It is durable and I wear it often. <end>  Quality piece  A very simple but well made quality product. Plus the stones are very clear with beautiful color. My daughter wants me to order one for her also. <end>
 B000IBW1L2  Laser Cut Two Tone Ring Band Sterling Silver Size 8 ||	  Looked good...for a while  Bought this as a thumb ring. It looked good until it turned my skin green. <end>
 B000IBXEOU  Trillion Round Cut Amethyst Citrine Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  not quite as pictured  The earrings I received had square dangles, rather than the circles pictured. However, the workmanship, even the packaging, is first class and delicately beautiful. I would definately buy from this company again. <end>
 B000IBXFTO  Trillion Cut London Blue Topaz Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Trillion Cut London Blue Topaz Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver  My daughter just loved it for XMAS <end>

I will order again from Peora Jewelry. <end>
 B000IBXJ1S  Round Cut Pink Cz Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Another excellent value from Peora  I purchased these earrings as a present for my Mother-in-law. As soon as she got them, she called my fiance up and raved about how much she loved them! She wore them to our wedding last week.These earrings are very nicely designed-- the stone doesn't overpower the silver work, but it's not too small either. The silver is beautifully shaped with no rough edges or marks, looks very classy and not cheap like a lot of silver earrings tend to.They also have a beautiful sparkle to them. Of course they shipped right on time and came in a lovely little gift box. Peora is a real class act. <end>

 B000IBXP8K  Unisex Oxidized Ring Band in Sterling Silver ||	  Cute ring.  The ring was cute. They dont turn the ring around to show you that the design does not go all the way around. Seller was pretty prompt with shipping it. Though I do not suggest buying from them as a gift for someone. Their sizing is off, so make sure you check it when you get it. (I ordered a size 9 and got a size 8) <end>
 B000IBXPBW  Unisex Oxidized Ring Band in Sterling Silver ||	  quality sterling ring  I ordered this sterling silver band for my husband for Christmas. I received my order in record time (a couple of days earlier than shipping indicated). That was an added bonus since it was a present. The ring came in a shipping box but inside, the ring came in a beautifully decorated ring box. No need for rewrapping.I was very pleased with the ring and so was my husband. The quality was far greater than the bargain price I paid. The ring has a thick band and a heavy feel that indicates quite a bit of silver is used in the manufacture of this ring. The design stamped on the band goes all the way around the band. I returned another company's ring because it didn't have the entire band decorated.An outstanding experience and a quality product. <end>
 B000IBXQ5C  Round Cut Swiss Blue Topaz Ring Sterling Silver Size 7 ||	  Nicer than it appears...  It's even prettier than the picture shows. The stone is a touch darker than it looks in the picture, but the shade fits the ring better. The heart-shaped accents on the side are a nice touch and I've gotten lots of comments on it in just the few days I've had it. It's a steal for the price! <end>
 B000IBXQBQ  Trillion Cut Amethyst Ring Sterling Silver Size 9 ||	  A gift for me..  I like differant and this ring was even nicer then the picture.

 B000IBXQVQ  Men's Round Cut White Cz Surgical Steel Ring Band Size 13 ||	  Nice  I got this ring back in 2007. Its been 2 years now and the ring has 3 stones missing from it. I bought this for $7 so for me to still be able to wear it now is great. Well worth the money <end>
 B000IBXRAG  3 in 1 Surgical Steel Puzzle Ring Set Size 10 ||	  Nice Ring  I love this nice heavy ring. It is so cute. I get lots of complaments on it. It fits together well & is comfortable to wear. I recomend it to anyone, even a man could wear this one. <end>
 B000IBZHF4  Oval Trillion Cut Citrine London Blue Topaz Drop Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  Nice present for a loved one - or yourself!  Very rich London Blue topaz. Good 'wearable' size for a woman. Shipped quickly in a decorative box. <end>  nice & inexpensive  I bought this for a friend; she was really pleased. It's great to have such a nice variety of inexpensive silver jewelery available. I know it would be untraditional, but it is difficult to get a feel for how jewelery would look "in real life" from the standard jewelery-seller photos. Hopefully I can get an action shot and submit it as a user picture. <end>  Beautiful birthday gift  I bought this for my sister - as it had both of her birthstones for November - Citrine & Topaz (depending on what lists you look at). She was touched by my thoughtfulness, and I was glad the price didn't put me out, although it looks like it did. ;) Very nice. <end>

 B000IBZIIA  Trillion Cut Amethyst Dangling Earrings Sterling Silver ||	  kind of cute  For the price of 9.99 I guess it is an ok buy but it does not seem so brilliant as shown in the picture.

You can't beat the price or the appearance of these really cute, lovely sterling silver amethyst earrings!The color is vibrant, the cut and size is just right -- I loved them so much that I bought the same pair for my sister as a surprise gift.They've gotten several unexpected compliments!

I'll definitely order from Peora again! <end>  Nicely Colored Gemstone  I really enjoy wearing this ring. I find myself looking at the stone throughout the day because it seems like it looks dark, then it looks lighter. It is very comfortable, solid and I especially like the setting. It is an elegant ring yet simple enough to wear every day. <end>  Gorgeous!  This ring looks remarkably classy and well made given its inexpensive price. The stone is lovely and the silver is very shiny. I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this piece on a whim...what a pleasent surprise! <end>  It's a lovely ring.  This ring is a beautiful every day ring. I ordered it because I love the neutral color of smoky quartz and this is a deal that can't be beat. The size is lovely and I've had a few people express jealousy at the ring's beauty. It's a lovely and elegant small ring, not overwhelming at all. I have thin fingers, so it was a bit bigger than I anticipated, but it fits well on my first finger instead. <end>
 B000IBZOLG  Round Cut Swiss Blue Topaz Ring Sterling Silver ||	  Beautiful little ring, it exceeded my expectations.  The ring looked nice in the picture, but when I got it arrived, I was even happier with it than I expected. The color and fit are right-on and I will be ordering more rings from this company. <end>

Bought to give as a gift but I think I'll keep for myself! <end>  Elegance  I want a basic earring pendant set that I can wear with casual or dress. This fits the bill perfectly.

She gets tons of compliments and they are extremely nice quality for earrings that are around 20 bucks. <end>  They are lovely.  Maybe a tad smaller than I had envisioned, but all in all, just lovely. No better word to describe them. <end>  Love These Earrings!  Item was delivered promptly and was packaged nicely. The earrings are great! They are shiny, petite, and just exactly what I wanted. Other reviewers mentioned how small they are, which is what prompted me to order them. At my age, I am not looking for large flashy earrings, but I am not too old to appreciate a nice looking pair of earrings. They go well with my wardrobe, especially jeans and other casual wear. <end>  Love these earrings  These earrings are very nice.

Great value for the price (a Lightning Deal). I'm SUPER fussy, and I can't fault these earrings in any way. <end>  Very Pretty  I've really enjoyed these earrings. They are one of my favorite pairs because I love the fact that they are small enough to keep from weighing down my lobes but large enough that they are visible. Great product! <end>  easy to loose  The first day I wore the earrings, I lost one. The earrings should have something in the back so they won't fall. I only enjoyed mine for a couple of hours. <end>  Filigree that's not too dainty  Being filigree makes them light enough to wear while still giving enough silvery impact! The picture makes them look like there is a lot of black, but that is really just the open design. The oval itself is about 1/2 inch long - perfect for a little movement. <end>  Beautiful earrings that shine!  These sterling silver Filigree Oval Drop Earrings look like they came from the Brighton Store for $100, but instead they came from Amazon.com for 80% less!! Great pricing Amazon! I paired these earrings with the matching necklace, and my wife loved them. Earrings shine from the sterling silver...they are not dull like the picture. A+ Amazon! A+! <end>  tiny but cute  These earrings go great with the matching necklace that is also sold on amazon. They are good quality, but they really are kind of small.

A nice weight and size with a shiny finish. A good choice for all occasions and outfits. <end>  LOVELY!  Very pretty earrings and the detail is dainty, yet perfect for every occasion.

Nice proportions. They're well suited to dressing up in the evening. <end>  Nice purchase  These little sterling silver earrings are very light weight (which I expected from the price) but very shiny and cute.

I really love them!Here is the link for the matching necklace Sterling Silver Filigree Oval Pendant, 18" <end>  So good  They are very elegant and delicate. It's not my favorite style actually (bought them as a present) but I'm satisfied. <end>  Beautiful and lightweight  Beautiful and lightweight earrings. They match and look like Brighton earrings.

They are lightweight, small and beautiful. I have gotten several compliments while wearing them. They are perfect for any occasion. They look way more expensive than they actually are. I have bought several items from the Amazon.com Collection and these are one of my favorites! <end>  Beautiful earrings at a great price  These have become my favorite earrings.

They can be worn casually or when dressing up and I consider them to be a really GREAT purchase..!! Bernice Knouse  ^) <end>  All that I hoped for  Earrings arrived promptly and were as described. Very feminine but not too small. I have enjoyed wearing them. They are similar to Brighton. <end>  Beautiful earrings  I love these earrings. Well made and just the right size. After I received them, I ordered the pendant and it is also very nice. I am very pleased with the quality and value of my Amazon jewlery purchases. <end>  They are pretty but way too small!!!  I truly liked them, but they are smaller than expected! Promptly delivered and well packaged. I recommend the product, just must to explain it size well, coz I haven't seen many earing that little. <end>  Picture doesn't do them justice  These are really pretty earrings and the picture is actually awful, I hate to say! They are actually very shiny and I always get compliments on them. Every single time I wear them. Great price, they go with everything. Love them! <end>  Love these!  These are so pretty and shiny! Picture doesn't do them justice. They are exactly as described. Can't beat the price and free shipping with Prime!I highly recommend. <end>  Perfect silver earrings  These are perfect silver earrings. These go well with smooth silver jewelery, with antiqued silver jewelery, and with filigree jewelery. <end>  Beautiful set  I bought thease earings and the matching pendant. They are very fancy, beautiful and well made. I am very happy with a purchase. <end>  As advertised  These ear rings were a gift and well recieived. For once, the 5 star rating was accurate. They were as adversted and rated. <end>  Very pretty ....  I purchased these for my sis-in-law for Christmas this year, and she LOVED them.It's a little hard to tell from the picture, but the overall length from top of curve of the wire to the bottom of the drop is 1". The filigree oval dangle part is just under 1/2" long, and just over 1/3" wide. They're delicate, but not so delicate that they can't be seen.The presentation is nice, too  they come in a little velvet drawstring bag inside a nice cardboard jewelry box, both in navy blue. The quality of the workmanship is excellent -- these look more expensive than they are.I may purchase a pair for myself, I liked them that much. Very nice, indeed. <end>  So nice, I bought them twice  My wife loved the filigree earrings. They were unique and elegant, I recommend getting the matching necklace. I word of advice-use those little rubber stoppers when you wear them, as they would occasionally fall off fairly easily. Which is how I ended up needing to buy a second pair. Now she has a spare earring. <end>  Budget expense!  These earrings are great! They match my expensive Lois Hill ring from a high end store. They are great quality for the cheap price and made of sterling silver. I am very pleased with the look, size 1/4-1/2 inches approx. and quality. If you are thinking about them, go for it! I did and am very pleased. <end>  Great looking earrings  You won't be disappointed if you purchase these earrings. They look great on and are well made. I will be buying the matching pendant. <end>  Extremely Pleased  I am very happy with these earrings. Considering the price, it's a bargain. These look like they cost double the actual price. I plan on stocking up now for birthday gifts for my friends & relatives!!! <end>  loved my gift  I received these earrings as a gift. The earrings are so light, it is as if you do not have anything on your ears. They are a beautiful silver. I highly recommend these earrings. I plan on buying a pair for my girlfriend. <end>  Attractive earrings  I guess I was one of the lucky ones to receive these earrings before they discontinued them. It appears that they are no longer available on Amazon and there is no expected date for them to return.These earrings are very fun to wear and not heavy at all. I like jewelry that is unique and these fit the bill. I think I'm going to check to see if there's a matching necklace. <end>  I just love these earrings!  These earrings are really nice. Lightweight, yet good quality. I'm very pleased with my purchase! May buy more as gifts! <end>  so beautiful, but tiiiiiinyyyy  very good quality, beautiful ornamentbut I should have really looked at the sizing - 26 millimeters is the size of my pinky finger nail(otherwise - nice piece of jewellery in a nice box <end>  Very nice!  The earrings are just what I'd pictured. They are quite beautiful and I shall enjoy wearing them the next time I get to go out. <end>  Love them  I gave these to my mom for Mothers Day and she seemed very pleased with them. She has arthritis in her hands so this type of earring is much easier for her to use than a post with the small back. She said she has received many compliments on them from people she has seen. <end>  Ear rings  i bought these for my wife as a gift. they are nice and math the necklace that i also purchased for her. <end>  Beautiful  I was looking for a pair of earrings that are classy and can potentially be worn on an every day basis. This pair hits the mark. The earrings are solid, obviously of good quality. They are not too big and not too small. The silver is nice and shiny, and they look great on. I can see wearing these with many outfits. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase, and just purchased the matching pendant. <end>  4 everyone  I love them. The size is great for pres teen to older lady's. The workmenship is lovely. For jeans or a little black dress. You cant go wrong. <end>  Perfect!  Perfect size (just an inch from the hook in the post to the bottom of the pendant), perfect weight (they're hollow so they aren't heavy), and just my style! <end>  Pretty earrings.  I ordered these because I have several necklaces that have filigree details. These matched everything perfectly. Thank you. I am very happy with the response and the speed of delivery. I order a lot of stuff from Amazon and I have yet to be disappointed. <end>  Sterling silver filigree oval drop earrings  These are the very best earrings in sterling silver that I have ever found! They go with practically everything that I wear. I love them very much! <end>  Oval drop earrings  Good on its own right. I expected them in a larger size than received, though; something to match the oval pendant purchased along with them. My mistake. <end>  Not too big--just right  These are great! I had a bad moment after I ordered these, suddenly wondering if they were going to be these huge balls bumping into my jawbone. Nope, they are just right, and made with quite a bit of silver; if you drop them, no way will they dent. Very nicely done. Thanks, Amazon. <end>  Beautiful & great quality  These earrings are every bit as beautiful as I hoped. The posts are not flimsy. They are very easy to wear - not too heavy but definitely solid. Great quality especially for the price. They came in a nice little box too. I love them! They go with everything so I wear them often. <end>

Can it? No. It really can't; not when you have the amazing funktastic Prada Plex Mary Pin. I'm telling you...this is the best thing you could ever wish for. Really. Seriously.Oh my god.No really. Like sometimes when I'm wearing this fantabulus pin these fat kids will like wanna try and eat it. And I'm like...hell yea fatty you try and eat this. And I like give them the pin and they grab with their fat little fingers and they try and eat it. But they fail and usually end up crying. It's the best $195 I have ever spent.Oh my god this pin is from Italy this pin is from Italy with a certificate that proves that it is, indeed, from Italy. So yeah...Italy is the best. Hurry up and buy this cause there's only like 5 left and they are millions of fat kids. That's a huge ratio difference there. You like, you buy, you Italy. I'm Italy. We are Italy. Italy sometimes is indefinitely Italy. This pin came from there; Certificate says so. Best in the world.Oh my god. <end>
 B000IHJNA8  Amazon.com  Silver Rhodium Cufflink | Banded Cylinder Cufflink  Clothing ||	  great for the money  I paid about $5(I wish everyone would make a point to say how much they paid on all their purchases since this makes a world of a difference when reading other user's reviews.)Great design and very clean looking.It looks like a $40 cuff link. <end>
 B000IHRQSE  14K White Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (3/8ctw, J-K, I2-I3) ||	  Smaller than they Appear Here  Good price and my wife liked them, but the diamonds are very... very small. I would say they appear here 10x larger than they are. <end>  ok  purchasing transaction was easy and smooth, delivered by expected time, and product met my expectations.. good price..but return was not as smooth <end>
 B000IHRRRE  14K White Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/2ctw, G-H, SI2-I1) ||	  Just what the doctor ordered...  Great earrings, very nice and just the quality advertised. Bought them for my wife on our first anniversary, big kudos. Would buy from Netaya again. <end>
 B000IHTURO  14K White Gold Round Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/3ctw, G-H, SI2-I1) ||	  Very Good  I have purchased this item a month ago and when I received the earrings they were just great. The earrings were good in color,clarity and cut.Have checked few dept store prices,ebay etc and this was a pertty good deal. I really loved them and the shine was very verygood.Worth spending the money and I hope to buy more from this jeweler when I see more good deals.Would certainly recommend buying this product <end>  awsome product  Delivered on time, product looks as good if not better than the picture. Overall very impressed. <end>  Excellent Quality  I purchased these as my girlfriend's christmas gift and she absolutely adores them. They're not too big (1/3 Carat) and heavy for those with small ears yet they are big enough to get the attention of almost any woman. Great cut and clarity and on top of that they're real diamond so overall a great purchase that is sure to light up her eyes. The only thing I could complain about was price but when compared to stores and other websites amazon had the best value in the end. +++++ <end>  Happy spouse  My wife was thrilled. The items are not too large, so they fit her secondary piercings perfectly. She hasn't taken them out since receiving them. <end>  Great pair of earrings  I bought these for my girlfriend's birthday and she loved them. They are small but they look great on small ears which most women have and they have a great sparkle to them. The color and clarity of them are as described and I defiantly would by from Netaya again. Great company to deal with. <end>  Be careful with this company  I purchased these earrings, and got them appraised. They were appraised at less than what I paid and got appraised at $245. I contacted NETAYA and they encouraged me to send them back for a free appraisal. They have since sent me back the wrong earrings that belong to another customer and sent my earrings to the wrong person. I am not a complainer but have been given a run around and not been told the truth. So while the earrings are pretty, be careful. FYI- I still don't have them back. <end>  Very nice earings  I am by no means a expert when it comes to diamonds or jewelery, but I did my research and read a ton of reviews and came upon these. They were very nice and I could not see any flaws with the nake eye and the color was very good as well. Great price and quick shipping. My girlfriend loved them! 1/3 ctw is a bit small, but I wasn't willing to fork over the cash for bigger and didn't want to skimp on quality. <end>  Much smaller than shown in the picture  If you are not familiar with carat size, you are going to be disappointed. These earrings are much smaller than shown in the picture. They are suitable for a baby rather than an adult.However, they do sparkle.UpdateI've had these for 4 months and they are nice, tiny earrings.Nonetheless, I lost (but found it later) one of the earrings in my house because one of the earrings has a loose friction-back closure. I should have checked them more carefully when they arrived and returned them. My earring had some problems so be aware. <end>  Order early.....  I am very unhappy with the customer service from Netaya. Delivery was promised on Dec. 5th, it's now Dec. 11th. It's being shipped today. Understanding it's holiday shopping season is the reason why I ordered it on Nov. 26th. I sent 2 emails with no response. Called once, had to leave a message and didn't get a return call for 2 days. To only be told they would have to call me back. I called them back. Just beware...order early!!! Haven't gotten the item ordered so can't review. <end>
 B000IHTV8M  14K White Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/2ctw, H-I, I1-I2) ||	  Awesome!  I am a bang for your buck kind of guy. This truly won me points with the wife. She loves them and they are just perfect. <end>  Never had in stock and never acknowledged my order.  I ordered these earings for my girlfriend's birthday and never received a confirmation of the order. I waited for a few days then called. They said then that they were out of stock. I go on Amazon today and they still say in stock and they are even offering $50.00 off at checkout. Well isnt that special. Offering $50.00 off an iten and saying it is in stock when it is not kinda rubs me the wrong way. I needed these things and now I am screwed. I would think twice before orderng from this company. <end>  My wife loves them!!!  I bought these for my wife for X-mas and she really loves them. <end>
 B000IHVPLS  14K Yellow Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/4ctw, J-K, I2-I3) ||	  Remember, they enlarge these photos!  Lovely earrings and well-made, but given the carat size, they are tiny on the ear. These earrings are best if you just want a subtle sparkle, or have multiple piercings. I gave mine to my 16-year-old daughter who wanted something everyday, but wanted them to be "real diamonds." She's pleased and I'm pleased with the price. As for me, I need at least 1/2 carat on each ear, so I"m buying CZ for that.... <end>  Beautiful Earrings  This is a very pretty gift for anyone. I've bought this and everyone in my family liked it very much. The diamonds are really very shiny. In a word, I just love it!!! <end>  Very nice!  My expectations were not high when I decided to purchase these. I was marvelously surprised by how bright and clear the diamonds were.Honestly, I was probably lucky. The diamonds are I2-I3 clarity, which is almost as low as you can get - creating a heavy hit-or-miss situation. It's possible you could end up with some visible inclusions. If so, return them - inclusions destroy the value of diamonds. Netaya is known for having jewelery of unpredictable quality - either it's really bad or really good.I'm giving 5 stars because of *my* personal experience with the product. My girlfriend loves them and wears them almost every day. I can see them glitter from a good distance away, even though they're not huge. Keep in mind that 1/4 carats is the TOTAL weight, so each diamond is 1/8 carats. This is probably the smallest respectable size for diamond earrings. Don't go lower.Pleased! I got a bargain and I'm happy. You could easily get a pair of these for $300. <end>  dissapointed  i really wanted something tiny to wear it everyday thats why i purchased them but i wanted also that it should be shiny sparkling and so theese earings are so dullll not shining at all i used to buy from nataya but this time i am dissapointed... <end>
 B000IHVQ30  14K White Gold Princess Diamond 4-Prong Stud Earrings (1/3ctw, H-I, I1-I2) ||	  High quality with a reasonable price  I loved my earrings. Can't take them off since I bought. The clarity is fine . If you have small ears like I do and don't like very big stud earrings , you're gonna love these. <end>  Price = Quality  The price reflects the quality. Large inclusions visible with the naked eye at 5-ft away render this a poor gift to give to a lady. Prompt refund made the disappointment a quick memory though. <end>
 B000IIHOLC  Pugster White Spotted Dog Brooches And Pins ||	  Cheap Cheap Cheap  This pin looks like something you would find at the dollar store. It is cheap looking and unremarkable. I was ashamed to give it to my friend as a Christmas gift so it ended up in the Christmas Connection Gift pile for homeless kids. <end>
 B000IIJIJS  Pugster Feather Clear Swarovski Crystal Diamond Accent Animal Brooches Pins ||	  Definitely Not Good Quality...  But eh, it's costume jewelry. I like it. It's going to be a nice addition to several costumes of mine. Thank you for a wonderful item! <end>
 B000IJTTQY  Clearly Charming Shiny Starter Italian Charm 18 Link Bracelet ||	  The Starter Italian Bracelet  I love the bracelet now that i have figured out how to use it. Had to write to the seller to find out how. Got a very quick response and now i understand it and wear it proudly. <end>  Great little bracelet!  This is a tremendous price for a nice little gift! Ordered these with a few charms and they made great inexpensive gifts for family members. Good quality & fast shipping! <end>  Great Bracelet  These were x-mas gifts. The girls in my Girl Scout troop loved them. <end>  Ahhhmazing  Came in the mail way sooner than expected, perfect timing for mothers day, beautiful bracelet and for the price I wouldn't dare complain, I would recommend this to any jewelry lover, great small gift, I WILL PURCHASE FROM THIS DEALER AGAIN! =) <end>  What fun!  These are so much fun for any age group. The girls I purchased these for are young and look they forward to adding charms reflecting their very own personalities and special interests. They enjoy being able to add, trade, remove charms whenever they wish, what fun! <end>  great starter bracelet  This is a very sturdy, good starter bracelet for anyone who wants to create an Italian charm bracelet! <end>  Perfect  they came in time, i was shocked at how good it looked at such a low price <end>  shopaholic  I just purchased a starter bracelet and two charms as a Christmas present. Not only was I pleased with the products, I was also impressed by how fast they arrived in the mail. I would definitely purchase from this seller again. Thank you, Clearly Charming! <end>  Was skeptical at first...but found out how to use it and it is GREAT  At first, when I got this band, I was confused as how to put it on.But when I realized how to do this, I fell in love with the band.For all those who bought this band and are unsure as how to use it,I would try to explain it to you.When you get the band, and you stretch it you would see that it has a kind of curved metal on one end that you have to place on the other end of the bracelet. Don't stretch the bracelet.Get a pin and pull out the metal part and try to place the curved part into the space on the other side of the link of the bracelet and you would see that the band is now perfectly round. <end>  Awesome!  I got this as my first charm bracelet, along with some charms, and they were great. Its a good price, and it came very fast in the mail. <end>  Very beautiful but confusing  This is a beautiful and inexpensive product. But it's hard to put the charms on it. I think it just takes practice though. <end>  Nice bracelet  I use this simpler starter bracelet for those who wouldn't appreciate a bracelet with paws, dolphins, hearts, or other pattern. <end>  Bracelet  I love this bracelet! My daughter loved it too! Great quality for the price. I will be ordering another one for my youngest daughter. Highly recommend this company! <end>  Love it!  My Husband purchased this charm bracelet for me for Christmas and I love it. Although I have not owned it for to long I have found the durability very well. it was difficult at first to place the set charms on the bracelet but after finding out how to I wouldn't be happier with how it looks. I am looking forward to adding charms to the collection, and hopefully getting my Daughter one when she comes to the right age. I would recommend. <end>  a good starter  I recently got into Italian charm bracelets because I think Pandora is just plain gaudy. This is a lovely way to start your collection. A good deal <end>  Starter Bracelet P.O.S.  I bought this thinking I was getting a fantastic price for what looked like a beautiful piece of jewelry. Lies. The price you pay is what you get. The metal was very hard and it hurt to wear. It pinched my skin and was very uncomfortable. I ended up not wearing it and bought a different one on Amazon for $5-- spend a few more dollars. It's worth it! I would not recommend this product. <end>  A gift well-received  We sent this to our niece for her eighth birthday. She loved it! I don't know how it is six months later, but it was a favorite at the time. <end>  Great gift!  I have gotten this as a gift for many loved ones along with personalized charms.Great quality - Great price - No issues. <end>  Awesome  Received this for my niece for a Christmas gift and it was perfect. She loved it and I had it in enought time for the holidays. <end>  i love this shiny charm bracelet! want to buy more charms for it! lol  my friend talked about these and seen them so i bought my friends,sisters and i one along with a charm. all of us had no complaints except that it may pinch when stretched. first time having one might take you awhile to figure out how to place a charm on it. that the fun part. lmao. however you can buy a tool for it to make it easier. It came in a lil clear package and received it within time. I enjoy how you can take off or put as many charms as you want. makes it easy for a small or thick wrist. I love clearly charming and the lil charms it comes with!  ) <end>  Starter Charm Bracelet  Was as stated. The charms available were exactly what I needed to buy. Looks good on. It has withstood my rough and tumble daughter quite well. We have had it for a number of months now and it is holding up well. <end>  Great!  I've had this Italian charm bracelet for two years now and it is still going strong. I don't wear it every day but I wear it often enough to say that it holds up well. It doesn't pinch the skin on my wrist like other Italian charm bracelets have in the past. It's easy to switch out the links. Don't hesitate to get yourself one! <end>  Dull and weathered looking.  I did not like this bracelet because I was expecting something shiny and my expectations are never to high. Anyways, the bracelet cam dull and weathered looking. I am rather disappointed but for the price, it's a steal!! <end>  Great Coumadin Medical Alert Bracelet  Clearly Charming Shiny Starter Italian Charm 18 Link BraceletThe Italian charm bracelet with this linkCoumadin Medical Alert Italian Charm Bracelet Linkis the best medical alert bracelet I have purchased. It is inexpensive, comfortable to wear, and can be put on and taken off without assistance. (Some of the heavy chain bracelets have difficult closure mechanisms.) Also it can easily be sized to fit. I recommend purchasing the inexpensive tool to do this, but it is not necessary.While the bracelet and charm did not come with instructions as to how to add and join links, I found several short videos on youtube that showed how to do it. <end>  Exactly as I expected  This was to replace a bracelet my daughter lost when one of the links broke. It is identical with one exception, it is a much better quality. The materials are stronger, the links are incredible. Very pleased. <end>  charm bracelet  The bracelet shipped on time and was exactly as described. I am pleased with the 5 I ordered. they are gifts for my daughters and Im sure they will be pleased with them as well <end>
 B000IK41X4  14k Yellow Gold, Round, Diamond Classic 4-Prong Pendant (1/3 ct, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Know your clarity  Make sure you review the clarity and grading scale before you purchase jewlery on line without seeing the piece first.This is clearly stated as a I2 - I3 clarity grade which is defined as containing large inclusions that are visible to the naked untrained eye.The grading is correct, my wife instantly notice a large black flaw in the diamond. You get what you pay for. <end>  Only one problem  My wife wears the pendant all the time. After about a year the diamond fell out and we had to have it repaired. <end>
 B000IKO6KC  Pugster Murano Glass Purple Blue And Gold Heart Pendant Necklace ||	  Not to scale!  It's quite big and chunky, much bigger than the picture looks. I wouldn't actually wear something this heavy around my neck. <end>
 B000IM7IBY  3" Long Hook Earrings with Copper-Tone Cascading Flower Shaped Filigree Metal Discs ||	  bold lovely earings  big,bold and stunning earings. These are well made. I only buy jewerly from silver insanity they are the BEST. Thanks for another great item. shipping was very fast <end>
 B000IMIWQ4  Cultured Pearl Platinum or Gold Overlay Sterling Silver Hook Bunch Earrings - Various Pearl Colors ||	  DONT MEASURE UP  I bought a lovely necklace that Amazon featured this set of earrings as well as a bracelet with as a "buy together for" deal. I was SO incredibly disappointed with these earrings! These were described as 4-5 mm, and the length 1.75". The image alone is deceiving. The actual "pearl" portion is only 1" long (see images I uploaded). If the seller had featured a picture of them being worn, I would have seen the pearls & overall earrings were much smaller. My husband, an engineer, measured the pearls with a caliper and found they were 3 mm at best, only 2 were 4 mm. The freshwater pearl necklace (from a different seller) looks NOTHING like these earrings and together look mismatched so I gave the earrings to my teenage daughter. For a 16 year old, these are fine, but I wouldn't rate these earrings better than any fake set you could buy at Claire's. I think I'm done purchasing jewelry on Amazon.com unless they start requiring sellers to post more images, especially of the item worn. <end>  Beautiful  I bought these earrings for my mother for Christmas. They were so pretty! First off, they came in a very nice box. When I opened it I was very pleased with the quality of the pearls and the workmanship. I feel like I got a lot more than I paid for. My mother loved them and they looked so nice on. I highly recommend this product and this seller. They have great quality and they ship quickly and in nice packaging. You can't ask for more! <end>  EXCELLENT!  I received my earrings a day after I ordered. The service is fast and the product is better. I'm 100% satisfied with these earrings. They are lustrous, and I can't stop looking at them!! <end>  Adorable - dress up or dress down  I received these for Mother's Day and love them. They are nicely made and have the right amount of dangle to be feminine and fun. The pearls have a nice luster and are smooth. The silver is shiny and well matched to the pearls. I would highly recommend these cute earrings. I wore them with jeans on the first day and got tons of compliments. <end>  Fabulous!  These earrings are absolutely beautiful. They were much more than I expected for the price and at this price you really cant beat it! I would definetly recommend! <end>  Gorgeous earrings  My husband surprised me with these earrings. I love them. I've gotten so many compliments on them that I'm thinking on getting the peach ones too. I love black pearls, and these just look gorgeous. The value is great and you won't be disappointed. They look at least as good as in the picture. <end>  look as great as photo--or better  These really look very beautiful! I was afraid they might look too big or heavy, but they are just perfect--very delicate! <end>  very pretty; glad the seller has listened to feedback!  I really like the earrings, though the other reviewer was correct--they are smaller than what the image/height stat. suggested. So I'm really pleased that there are new images up with a measurement guide to avoid future confusion. But overall, I'm pleased. <end>  Nice job  I love my earrings and the service was great. I would recommend the site to my friends. Great overall.White Cultured Pearl Bunch Earrings <end>  Beautiful earrings, and nice quality  I purchased these earrings as a gift for my daughter. They arrived quickly and were a perfect match for necklace, which she already has. They are a very nice quality. The color is fantastic! We are very happy with the purchase. <end>  Grape pods.  I gave this as a gift, but it is so beautiful. My daughter really loves them. They match a previous gift from Amazon. <end>  Delicate, lovely and expensive looking.  My favorite pair of pearl earrings kept losing pearls. I have been looking for something similar for years. Having given up on the button cluster posts, I started looking for other kinds of clusters not reliant on glue. These caught my eye and have not disappointed. They are quite lovely and have an appeal similar to the ones I could not keep together. <end>  Beautiful  I purchased these for my mom for Christmas. They really are pretty. They lay and move very nicely and are a good length for dangly earrings. Big enough to be noticed but not so long as to be gaudy. <end>
 B000IMO4IO  18K Gold Over Sterling Silver Leaf Design Earrings ||	  Wished I would have ordered two  These earrings are lovely. I gave them to my mother-in-law as a gift. I wish I would have ordered myself a pair. <end>  I think they are not 100% silver/gold  The earrings are cute but they changed color very quickly (faded into some strange grayish color) and I think they are not 100% silver/gold because I got nickel allergy and I reacted on the earrings very badly. <end>  Perfectly lovely  Very nice earrings that can be worn casually, but also look good at the office. Definitely a good deal and good quality. <end>  Pretty Good!  Looks very good.The finish is a little rough (in close), but thats what you get for the price. <end>
 B000IOGVII  Sterling Silver Golden Shadow Crystal 27mm Star Pendant Charm Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Very pretty!  This pendant is quite large, so make sure you look at the dimensions to ensure it fits your expectations. I love it and love the way it sparkles. <end>
 B000IQ7PFE  Sterling Silver Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace (10-11mm), 17" ||	  Nice small gift  Bought this for my 8 year old to give his mom as a gift. I'm very pleased with the purchase and the wife loved it. Not more stars because it appears a bit "clunky" - but for the price, great buy. <end>
 B000IQ9JLW  Sterling Silver Amethyst and White Freshwater Cultured Pearl Chain "Y" Necklace (4-10mm), 16.5+3" Extender ||	  gorgeous!  I rarely buy jewelry from amazon because it is so hard to tell the quality from a photo. but this necklace had a 50% off special and I took a shot-- I LOVE IT! it is delicate but not cheap looking. chain is very fine, which doesn't mean flimsy. clasp is substantial and easy to manipulate. don't hesitate to buy! <end>  dressy or casual  This is a beautiful necklace I bought as a gift. It's great because it can either be worn on casual or formal occasions. <end>  Not As Nice As Expected  From the reviews, I expected this item to be quite nice but it was really ordinary and not something that I would wear. I kept it to give as a gift to a young niece. She'll enjoy it.The seller did ship it very quickly. No complaints there. <end>
 B000IQ9JQM  5 Pair Set Dyed Multicolor Pastel Freshwater Cultured Pearl Earrings (8-8.5mm) ||	  Beautiful set of earrings  I am very happy with my pearl earring. They are a nice size, not too large. I had to exchange mine because some were not the same shape, but now I am very happy with the new set. I would recommend these for anyone who likes pearls. <end>  Very nice pearls and a good price  Very nice, my daughter was thrilled. The pearls are larger than I expected, and nicely rounded. Very satisfied and would recommend these. <end>  very pretty  I got these on a gold box special and they are very pretty. Since I already had a pair of pearl studs I gave the cream to my oldest daughter and she loves them. <end>  Great Deal  These earrings are lovely and very light weight. The colors aren't quite as saturated as they appeared in the picture, but they are still easily distinguishable from one another. <end>  right size, bad colors  These earrings were the perfect size, unfortunately, the colors were so pale it was hard to tell one color from another. I returned them. <end>  Cute, good sized pearls  I really like these pearls, just got them as a Christmas gift. I felt the size was very large and the colors and sizes are really well matched. I'm really happy with the purchase and this is a great deal for 5 pairs. The pink is a very nice pale color, I thought the green was a little bright and doubt I'll wear them often. The orange/yellow is a strange color and will also not be in daily rotation. I'm really impressed with them overall and am happy with Amazon.com's collection <end>  For the price--nice! But colors subtler than shown  I got these on a today's deal, and I have to admit, I'm pleased with them. They are pretty, are actually a good size for my ears (not tiny-hard-to-see size).The colors are MUCH subtler than the picture amazon has here. But, that said, they still are attractive and usable. A good everyday sort of set of earrings. If you wear a lot of pastels or pale colors and like the feminine look of pearls, I say get it. Not expensive, discreet, pretty.Mir <end>  Great Gold Box Deal  I got these for $19.99 as a gold box deal. I even qualified for super saving shipping. I was quite happy when I opened the box. These earrings are very, very pretty! I am giving them to my 16 year old daughter for Christmas. I know she will love them because she will have a color to match any outfit. And she is VERY into color coordinating. And since she is a super picky child, if she doesn't like them I will be very happy to wear them! <end>  earrings  Great buy and good-looking, too. I purchased them for a gift and intend on ordering more for myself. <end>  Freshwater pearls are lovely  This little collection of dyed freshwater pearls was perhaps the best purchase decision of my holiday season. i split the pearl sets up among our family members, and each of them raved about the beauty and quality. The color and size of each of the earring sets was more than I had expected; each pearl, no matter what the color, bore a luster so lovely that I was almost embarrassed when I gave them as gifts; I knew the receiver thought she was the most special person on my list!!! <end>  Good value  I got these for my wife on Mother's Day between purchases ofFreshwater Cultured Pearl, Citrine, Peridot & Amethyst Bracelet, 7.5"on Valentine's Day andFreshwater Cultured Pearl, Citrine, Peridot & Amethyst Necklace, 18"for our anniversary in July. She likes them a lot, but I also had a friend who makes jewelry create something reminiscent of14k Yellow Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl, Peridot, and Blue Topaz Earringsthough in sterling silver. She REALLY loved the earrings my friend made, so she doesn't wear these as much. <end>  Nice pearls  I got this set of earrings about a year ago. They are all good quality and look very nice. I am very pleased! <end>  Very dissapointing  I returned the pearl earings. They were of very poor quality. The colors were not pretty and the shapes were not even. <end>  I consider it a good purchase  These earrings are really pretty. There are not real great variations in the color between each set (they are all pastel, after all!) but each has a beautiful sheen and color.They are also set very firmly on the backs - I was worried that, for the price, they wouldn't hold up. But they are very nicely made.The packaging was okay, but not deluxe. What I appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls, which I found informative.All in all a good purchase and well worth the money! <end>  Elegant and simple  I just recently had my ears pierced and needed something small that I could wear continually on a daily casual basis without the earrings looking too dressy. These earrings are just perfect for that purpose. They are simple elegance with genuine pearls and sterling silver findings. They are even confortable enough to wear while sleeping. I am wearing the white pearl set right now. Love them! <end>  received rave reviews from wife  Earrings were very attractive and nicely packaged. My wife was very pleased because so many options were available to her to wear with other multi-colored pearls. Great value. <end>  Better Than I Expected  I am very pleased with the pretty shades of the pearls and the size was even bigger than I expected. The only thing that would have them even better was bigger flat backings. I have very small ear lobes so they flopped forward. I remedied that by changing the backings. I am wearing them with so many things and really enjoying them. <end>  Real Pearls.  As with all natural pearls, the shapes are not perfect. Only cultured pearls are perfect, because man controls them. The dye is uniform and the size is perfect, big enough that they can be seen easily. The colors; pink, white, gold, and lavender are clear. Even the green is a clear green, just not my favorite green. <end>  Perfect gift for our daughter  We happened across these as a Gold Box item, and decided they were the perfect size and color for our daughter as an Easter present. They came nicely packaged, and are some of her favorites. My wife now wants the same in different colors  ) <end>  I really wanted to like them, but...  they just weren't as vibrant of colors as pictured. Maybe I got a bad set? The differences between the yellow, pink, and white were minimal. I kept them for a couple days to look at them and hope that maybe they'd grow on me, but they didn't. I'm submitting them for return, with the hope I'll find something here to take their place. On the other hand besides my disappointment with the color, they were good quality earrings. <end>  Good Earrings  The pearls are nicely matched, and are a good size. I wish the posts were a little longer, and the studs a little bigger. I do enjoy wearing them. <end>  Cute, elegant!  I love these! They are such a good deal for the price, and come in a nice box. They are much better than what I was expecting.   ) Colours are a nice pastel, and would go with lots of different things. Pearls are large but not too large - just right! <end>  Super cute!!!!  All right so these earrings are absolutely adorable! They are fun and go with anything! Good size. Good quality. I would buy for someone as a gift! <end>
 B000IQ9JV2  Amethyst and Freshwater Cultured Pearl Dangle Earrings with Sterling Silver Hooks ||	  These go great with my amethyst bracelet!  I bought these lovely dangle earrings to complement the amethyst-and-freshwater-pearl stretch bracelet that I'd purchased from Amazon earlier. I'm very pleased with them. I enjoy the way they sparkle when the light catches them as they sway back and forth with my movements.Gorgeous purple color! You would have to see both pieces of jewelry together to appreciate the true beauty, but I'm the center of attention whenever I wear them. And that ain't bad for the old ego.Highly recommended!Reviewed by  Betty Dravis, 20081106 Grand Boulevard <end>  Mom liked them  They were a lot bigger in person than they looked. That bottom pearl is about the size of an M&M (only round). They were a gift for my mom and she liked them so I guess thats all that matters. <end>  Earrings  After receiving the earrings, I felt it was a great value for the cost. <end>  Sterling Silver, Amethyst and Freshwater Cultured Pearl Dangle Earrings  My wife was very happy with these earrings. I was pleased that they looked more expensive than what I paid and the sale price was very good. <end>  Disappointed  I thought these were going to be made in the USA. They are not. They are just mass produced out of the country, I will not order from this vendor again. <end>  Lots of Pearls  I was surprised at the number of pearls to amethyst chips - my pair looks very elegant, but I had hoped for more of an amethyst presence, since it was to go with the amy/pearl stretch bracelet. Lovely nonetheless. <end>  HUGE earrings!  I still can't believe how big these earrings are! They are also very pretty, so I'll probably keep them anyway. Definitely not for everyday wear, unless you want to go for the drama. The picture is deceiving, it makes them look smaller. Pity. <end>
 B000IQB57S  Dyed Oval Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace with Sterling Silver Beads (8.5-11mm), 18" ||	  As my friend always says, "Very Nice"  Let me say that I get a lot of compliments for this necklace. When I have told people how much I have paid for it, they just don't believe me that I spent what I have as it is cheaper than their expectations. The picture to me seems very accurate in that the pearls are large and shiny. The thing I was not expecting was the weight as this is a substantial piece. You know when you are wearing this necklace! And to me, that is "very nice!" <end>
 B000IQCF2C  Multi-Color Long Freshwater Cultured Pearl Necklace, 72" ||	  Multi-color freshwater pearl necklace  This necklace is beautifuland I was pleased to see that the pearls were nice and large. Every time I wear them, I receive the nicest compliments. <end>
 B000IQCFD6  Sterling Silver Dragonfly Pin with Peach and White Freshwater Cultured Pearls and Garnet ||	  Nice brooch  This pin was a hit as a Mother's Day gift. Good quality jewelry, nice packaging, and overnight delivery because it comes directly from Amazon - no 3rd party dealers. <end>
 B000IRZF8C  10K Three-Stone Diamond Tennis Bracelet (1/2 cttw) ||	  It is a great present for the price!  If you do not have too much money and you want to impress your girlfriend, this is the present you want to give her! Sparkling - after all, it IS white gold and diamonds! <end>
 B000IS4HBW  14k White Gold, Tear Drop Diamond Pendant (.25 cttw, G-H Color, I1 Clarity) ||	  AMAZON service  This review is not about the product (I have not received it yet) but about the Amazon service itself.When saying I have not received it yet, I am not entirelly correct. I did received the box, with the jewelry box inside. The problem was that when I opened the jewelry box, there was nothing inside! That is correct, it was empty! My guess is someone in the wharehouses took it from the box before shipping it, but I will never know... The worst thing was that this was supposed to be a gift for my wife for Christmas.Now, the Amazon service was kind enough to try to re-send it as soon as they could, but it will not arrive before tommorrow, which is Dec. 27, way after Christmas! Hope THAT box will have something inside (don't hold my breath though). Arrrrrgh! <end>
 B000IS4HG2  14k White, Yellow, and Pink Gold, Butterfly Diamond Pendant (.41 cttw, G-H Color, I1 Clarity) ||	  Beautiful!  I wear this 24/7 and it never looks dull! Gets a lot of compliments =) <end>  LOVELY, FEMININE, FINE QUALITY, SOLID & SPARKLING NECKLACE!!!!!  The photo does not come close to doing justice to this absolutely lovely, feminine, fine quality and sparkling pendant with a smooth and shiney box chain. The diamonds are gorgeous and pave set. Comes in a quality gift box too. I am very impressed with my purchase and the price is a real bargain!! Would make a fabulous gift for that special person in your life. You will be very happy with this great deal from Amazon!! <end>
 B000ITWHZ4  One Silicone Double Flared Skin Eyelet  6g, wearable length  1/4", Clear (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  nice  would recommend. loved this, its just theyre so transparent i misplaced them and couldnt recover them )  i will reorder soon. <end>
 B000IU1R68  One Silicone Double Flared Skin Eyelet  4g, wearable length  1/4", Black (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  Don't even know they are there!!!  Just purchased 4 of the Skin Eyelets from Steel Navel in 2g, 4g and 6g. First off shipping was very prompt and all items were exactly as described.As far as the Skin Eyelets they are pretty sweet. They are so lightweight you don't even know they are there. I work in a cold storage facility and not wearing metal in my ears is really nice. The cold used to sink right in before. Another nice thing about these is they don't cause the usual foul smell that other jewelry does. They are flared just enough to hold them in. I have had three in for a week and have not had any come out when sleeping or showering.Putting them in, especially the smaller sizes was a little tricky. In fact I could not get the 6g one in until I had a brainstorm. I folded the Skin Eyelet side to side twice and put in in the non-flared end of one of my single flared tunnels leaving just enough to grip out of it. I slid the tunnel in enough to grip the Eyelet from the back and held it as I pulled the tunnel back out. The Eyelet unfolded and was in as easy as that with some slight adjustment. The bigger sizes are a little easier to get in without any kind of assistance.All in all I am happy with these. How long they will hold up is hard to tell. But for now this is all I will wear. So much more comfortable than metal. <end>
 B000IU5C5K  Naruto  Leaf Symbol Necklace ||	  My little sister loves it  My sister is mad for naruto, so this gift was perfect for her. She still wears it (6 months later) almost every day. <end>  Durable  Recipient wore this the first few weeks after receiving this item. After that, it is forgotten. Use it for cosplay, but other than that? <end>  Even got a compliment from some old people!  I bought this necklace with the motto  never give up! in mind. Not only as a personal reminder to do my best, this necklace is just awesome! it's very durable and people give me compliments on it all the time ( strange eh? ) and of course, fellow anime watchers / manga readers identify me quite well! <end>  Pretty good  Got this for a friend as a present who likes naruto/anime. It came before the estimated date which was nice, and its very good quality. <end>  my favorite accessory  i wear it everyday religiously,like the other reviewer said,it reminds me to never give up and all the other things naruto stands for.its also a great way to show your love of naruto without having to wear the headband everywhere and look like a geek lol. <end>  Wear it Everyday....  I got this for Christmas, and I wear it everyday. It came fast and on time. There's nothing really else to say, it is beautiful and durable. Like others have said, when I wear it I always think about all the things Naruto stands for and it's messages...To try your best and never give up c  Love it and Naruto. <end>  Its A Beaut!  I couldn't be happier with this purchase! Its a gift for my friend who introduced me to anime and who loves the hell out of Naruto so this was of course the go to gift! i know she will FREAK and Love it! Simply Flawless! <end>  Love it!!!  I'm a HUGE Naruto fan and this was just so perf!!! I wear it almost everyday! It's so funny because I'm extremely girly and I always get people asking how it doesn't go with how I dress. But that doesn't stop me I'm totally in love with it! It's really durable and it amazingly doesn't look cheap at all! It's totally worth the buy! <end>  amazing!!  this product is of really good quality.it is highly durable and a burst of excitement runs through meevery time i set my eyes on my own XDlove it! <end>  Necklace Specifications  Everybody else from the reviews pretty much summed up all there is to this necklace. The only thing I want to add to the topic is the specifications, as well as some pictures. One of the things I always hated when buying accessories or other items is when they don't submit enough information as to the specs. What's the point of knowing how much it weighs, if I don't know if it'll fit me? What if it's too long for my taste, or if don't like the clasp? Sometimes it can be risky, and even though you may able to return it, it can be just plain troublesome. Well, that's enough ranting from me. lol Here are the specs It has curb type of chain that is 24 inches long from one end to the other. The Konoha symbol measures 2.1 inches from the triangle tip to the end that sticks out of the spiral. The chain is secured by a lobster claw type of clasp. This necklace will definitely make you stand out, and it's a nice gift for fellow Naruto fans. I truly recommend it! <end>  Leaf necklace  I hang this over my rear view mirror, the chain is longer than I anticipated, however its manageable.The quality is 3.5/5, obviously not the highest quality material or craftsmanship but if you are a fan of naruto and this symbol has a meaning to you then it is easily overlooked.I do not wear it so I cannot rate its durability fairly.This piece is a tad bit overpriced, its targeted towards fans as a luxury item so they can upscale the price but its still worth it to me. <end>  A gift for my grandson  This necklace is more than I expected for the cost. I'm sure my grandson will enjoy it. <end>
 B000IVKV1E  Jewelry Display Stand - 3 pcs - Silver Dancers ||	  Decorative and functional  These are very cute on my makeup vanity. It's very useful for pieces that I wear the most and keep what I don't use as much in my larger jewelery box. They stand up pretty well and the finish on the metal is nice. You can hang more than 7 sets of earrings if you place them right (any parts that curve can be used to hang earrings). I use their heads to put my rings on them too. <end>
 B000IVKYK2  Amazon.com  Prada Women&#39;s Plex Mary Pin, Rosso/Bianco  Clothing ||	  Can it get better than this? I think not.  Oh my god. It can't get any better than this. I mean; seriously. Can it? No. It really can't; not when you have the amazing funktastic Prada Plex Mary Pin. I'm telling you...this is the best thing you could ever wish for. Really. Seriously.Oh my god.No really. Like sometimes when I'm wearing this fantabulus pin these fat kids will like wanna try and eat it. And I'm like...hell yea fatty you try and eat this. And I like give them the pin and they grab with their fat little fingers and they try and eat it. But they fail and usually end up crying. It's the best $195 I have ever spent.Oh my god this pin is from Italy this pin is from Italy with a certificate that proves that it is, indeed, from Italy. So yeah...Italy is the best. Hurry up and buy this cause there's only like 5 left and they are millions of fat kids. That's a huge ratio difference there. You like, you buy, you Italy. I'm Italy. We are Italy. Italy sometimes is indefinitely Italy. This pin came from there; Certificate says so. Best in the world.Oh my god. <end>
 B000IVV95Q  Dark Green Jasper and Peridot Earrings ||	  earings  I picked these earrings out for my parents to get me for my birthday, and absolutely love them. They look almost exactly like the picture, the only difference is the Jasper, people need to understand that It is a natural stone, and the stone might vary in color and pattern. The Earrings are not heavy, and don't seem to bother sensitive ears. <end>  Beautiful, high quality jewelry  These earrings are very well-made & they are just beautiful. They are not heavy to wear. I get a lot of compliments when I wear them. Be sure to get the matching pendant from the same vendor. I have been very happy with these purchases. It is hard to buy jewelry sight-unseen. But this jewelry was everything I hoped for & more. <end>
 B000IWMUP8  Diamond Skull And Crossbones Ring In Sterling Silver Size 5 ||	  Gets more compliments than her rack  My wife has been--well, let's just say, "endowed by her creator with certain delightful gifts," ones whose size are often measured in letters (wow, what an un-tactful way of trying to be tactful--if my wife ever read this, she'd punch me).I got this for my wife as a Christmas present several years ago; she gets more complements on this ring than any other piece of jewelry she owns. And she's delighted that more people's attention seem to be drawn to this ring than *ahem* anything else. <end>
 B000IWMURG  2.00 Carat Canary Yellow And 2.00 Ct. T.W. White Cz Ring. Size 5 ||	  Pretty ring - fun to wear!  Received this for mother's day...nothing easier for hubby than circling the items I like in the Ross Simons catalog. This ring is very pretty on, just like the picture. Fits well, and tons of sparkle. There is a great deal of wow factor for this ring, I've had lots of comments on it. I like it overall very well, at least until the lotto comes in and I can afford the real deal! <end>
 B000IWZWFS  Good Luck Sterling Silver Pave CZ Four Leaf Clover Pendant ||	  i was "lucky" to find this!  My daughter told me she would like a four leaf clover necklace for christmas. After searching all of our local stores, I did not find anything I really liked. I was reluctant to buy jewelry online, since it's hard to tell what the item actually looks like. But I found Eve's Addiction, and Im glad I did. This necklace arrived the other day, and it's lovely. I can't wait to give it to Jessie. Of the other necklaces I've seen, it's actually hard to tell sometimes what the clover really is. Not with this one. And I was afraid the CZ on the necklace would look tacky, but it's actually so different and attractive, I was delighted. And the chain is pretty and dainty. The price of this item is incredible for the quality of the jewelry. I know I sound like I'm gushing, but I'm sincere, this is a beautiful and affordable piece. It's really so much nicer than the picture depicts. It came in a nice box, and inside the box, the necklace is in a pretty pouch, and they even included a card with a personal message. I can't say enough about how happy I am with this purchase. <end>  Nice little Pendant  Not the highest quality item in the world, but it's durable and it made my wife happy. Unless the four-leaf clover is of particular interest to you or the person you are giving this to, I might look for something else. <end>
 B000IWZWKI  The Sandy Beach CZ Starfish Sterling Silver Necklace ||	  Nice, but a little smaller than I expected for the price  This neclace is very pretty, but the chain is TINY, it looks like you could just snap it in half with very little effort, so I wasn't happy with the chain, but the pendant is very pretty. I bought some rings off this site too, and the quality of those was just amazing for the price. I am pregnant, so I needed a fake wedding ring to act as my real one until my swelling went down. So I bought two sets from Eve's Addiction and they are beautiful, and they look very real! I wear them everyday and shower, wash dishes etc, no tarnish and no green fingers. I clean them with soap and water and they shine like new. This neclace is the same. <end>  I love my starfish necklace!  The Sandy Beach CZ Starfish Sterling Silver NecklaceI like this necklace very much. It's different from the other starfish necklaces I have seen because only half of it has the cz's on it. At first I thought it might be too large, but when I wore it with a low cut shirt, it is the perfect size. It will look great with my spring/summer shirts. <end>  Ok if you are not looking for Quality just cute  This looked so good on the screen. When you get it, it is very thing and kind of cheep looking. I would have sent it back if I had purchased it my self but it was a gift from my Mother in law and I would never hurt he feelings she is so wonderful. <end>
 B000IX9Y7O  Laser Cut Knot Style Bangle Bracelet Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  GEORGEOUS! GEORGEOUS! GEORGEOUS!  This bracelet was purchased for my sisters birthday. She loves bangles, and has a small wrist. The only thing, the bracelet does not state what size it is but I took a chance and it is a 7". It just fits me so I know it will fit her. Not only that, it has an "S" clasp which means it can be enlarged simply by adding an extra round circular link or two. In addition, it is a real "sparkler" and is very delicate looking. This bracelet is designed for a smaller wrist; under 7" for a nice fit. It is truly stunning, and unbelievable quality for the price. <end>
 B000IXKYBO  10k White Gold Journey Curve Pendant (.15 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Beware  Baby size pendant on flimsy chain!  The pendant is pretty - if you look at it through a magnifying glass! I just received it today, and I am thoroughly disappointed. The whole thing is so tiny and the chain downright flimsy, I just know that I will never wear it. So now I have to return it and pay for postage, too - stay away from this item!!! <end>  Returned it  Picture looks great....but not the product itself. Save your money or spend extra few bucks to get a bettr one. <end>  The worst pendant ever!  The size of this thing is miserable, it can barely be seen! Buyers beware, this pendant is way too small and low quality. Never buy jewelry from amazon! <end>  You get what you pay for  Was on sale for $50, and that's about all I would consider it to be worth. Nice chain, though. <end>  pendant  You get what you pay for! the pendent is tiny. i knew that and that is fine. i didn't want a big one. it is beautiful and wears well. the only complaint i have is the chain is too thin. i have to be so very careful because if it gets caught on anything, it will just break. It really does concern me so i will have to buy another one when i find it that i think is more sterdy that won't break as easy. don't expect anything huge! <end>  Nice, but chain is weak  I believe the title says it all.Basically, the necklace is quite nice, and my girlfriend was very pleased to recieve it. The stones are not exactly big, so make sure you understand how much .15 cttw is. But they are big enough to be seen at least.The chain itself however, lacks. It was too weak to last 2 weeks. So if you do buy this, make sure that she wears it only sparingly, or buy a heavier chain. <end>  Pendant  I think the pendant was great for the price, but the chain was frail. <end>  TOO SMALL!!!  I wish that I had paid more attention to the size in the description. It is much smaller than I had hoped for. Considering the "original" price, I had expected something a little bigger. I'll be much more careful in the future. <end>  Much smaller than the picture in the amazon ad shows  Would not recommend getting this. Had to return it. <end>  You get what you pay for  The picture you see is slightly decieving. The item is small and the chain is weak. It is worth the $49 I paid for it. Not a great deal by any means. If I would have paid the list price, i'd be talking to Amazons refund dept. <end>  Just OK  The necklace was just OK, nothing spectacular. The adage - "you get what you pay for" comes to mind. <end>  Never again for jewelry sale !!!  The image does not at all correspond to the real thing  the real thing is NOthing!!!!Don't make the same mistake as I did!!!Good luck!!!! <end>  not satisfied  I have sent the necklace back several weeks ago and I have not heard a reply, gotten my money back NOTHING!! I would like my money back please!!! <end>  white gold  yes the diamonds will be small--but are usually set in a way they look bigger...the white gold in itself is worth this price...go to a jewelry store and try to buy this at this price--can't be done---go ahead guys--nice gift for the lady in your life... <end>  diamonds -- where?  I hope anyone who buys this knows what .15 total carat weight means. Looks like a pretty enough necklace, though, and good for people are into the shape of the "journey" jewelry. Just don't expect a curvy row of big, shiny diamonds when you order this. <end>
 B000IXKZBI  Earrings Endless Hoop Small size - 14kt White Gold ||	  tiny and elegant  These earrings ARE small and very thin. I have 4-5 pairs of them, because I have my ears pierced multiple times, and do you know how HARD it is to find small earrings of HIGH quality, that you can leave in for years at a time, and which do not only NOT get tarnished or dirty, but are completely comfortable to sleep in? Most small hoops are too thick to be comfortable at the top of my ears, or have an annoying back. Anyway, if you have an infant, or if you have multiple ear piercings, these things are great to keep in for extended-wear. They look elegant and FEEL GREAT. And they never accidentally come off. Or cause the infections that can occur with silver earrings. I have these at the tops of my ears and I can't even feel them when I sleep. I usually forget I'm wearing earrings at all. I love these and want and endless supply of them. <end>  Fantastic!  Perfect, just what I was looking for. These are very tiny earrings and I never take them out, I always want my ears to be pierced, there was a while where I wouldn't want to wear earrings to sleep but then I'd be going to an event and trying to stick earrings back in my ears and it just wasn't worth it so I invested in earrings I could wear all the time to keep my ears pierced. These are very simple small hoops, I even wear these under sparring gear when I fight. Never had a problem with it, for those who don't know how to put these in, you need to bend it first and bend it back when it's in your ear and lock it in that tiny hole on the other side. <end>  Finally Found after a Long Search  Although these were a little smaller than I wanted, they are perfect. These are a replacement for some hoops that have been in my ears since 1996 and have literally fallen apart. These are small, yes, a little tricky to do the catch, yes, but once done, it's done. Perfect for earrings you put on and leave in. And yes, I have multiple piercings. Like I said, they're perfect. And I'm buying more as "back-up". <end>  Really Really Bad Earrings  The design is horrible. I could not get them to go into my ear at all. I was trying to use them for my cartilage piercing but the piece of metal that extends from the top to allow for it to lock onto the loop, makes it impossible for it to go through your piercing hole. It's ridiculous in design. The size was perfect, but since I can't even get it into my ear there's no reason to rate it higher than a one star since I have to return them. <end>  true review  small is an understatement more like micro, TINY, teeny, width of a human hair i have chain links in necklaces that are bigger in diameter and circumfrence <end>
 B000IXSZJM  Amazon.com  Aum (Om) Pendant  Clothing ||	  Beautiful  This is beautiful. The pendant arrived quickly, did not take long at all. Very good quality, I recommend it highly. <end>
 B000IY9UN6  Pugster Jewelry Orange Aventurine Jewelry Sets Earring Bead Fashion Chip Stone Bracelets Pendant Necklace ||	  Nice jewelry at great value  This set looks really great in person and the colors are nice for just about any neutral color outfit. I have bad it for about 2 months now and the quality is pretty good. None of the prices have worn or broke and I wear the set at least once a weak. Definitely would have paid more for this. It really was a great value at about $15 with shipping. <end>

 B000IZ69BG  8" Lumistick Glowsticks Glow Stick Bracelets BLUE (Tube of 100) ||	  Glow sticks review  The glowsticks did what they were supposed to! Nice bright blue glow!Well packaged and delivered very promptly and efficiently.Only concern is that since (once activated) they contain broken glass, they are potentially a liability with young kids who are intent on chewing and bending them beyond their limitations...!It would be helpful if the packaging could be labelled with clearer warnings of whether the glowsticks contain toxic chemicals and whether (if chewed till severed) ingestion of contents is likely to be dangerous (besides the risks of the broken glass)! <end>  Pretty good  They worked for about 5 hrs - not all sticks worked about 20-30 would not light up. Dollar store ones worked as well <end>  Wonderful!  I bought these for my son's birthday party. So far we have tested two of the glow sticks and they work great and last a long time. Very happy with them! <end>  Perfect  I purchesed these as well as orage for my wedding centerpieces. they worked great and stayed bright thoughout the entire reception, the kids ended up disasembaling my centerpieces, but i didnt mind, bc that brought on a whole new fun!!! <end>  Good value for parties!  These came in a tube, so they were secure in shipping. The shipping cost was ridiculous from the vendor. They were a good blue hue when they glowed + lasted all night. It came with a bag of bracelet connectors that were easy to use, but easy to lose/drop so had to be careful. Overall they were great for a large party + kids really liked them alot. Much cheaper than the store + would buy again if the shipping cost was more reasonable. <end>  Great for Parties  These are great for any party. I bought these to hand out at the club as we celebrated a birthday. All blue for male birthday. These probably last about 5 hours.If you want to let every one know who's part of your crew this is a good way of getting the attention you want. ;-) <end>  Synchronized Swimming  I ordered these for my classes Synchronized Swimming performance. They were wonderful, even though we had way to many for the first performance. We cracked them about an hour before the performance and they made it all the way through (this was for our last song).My only problem was that the connectors that were included had issues holding the sticks, not sure if it was the connector or our fault. Also some of the connectors ended up getting a slit in them making them useless.Over all wonderful product and made our performance so much better.(meant to put this on the green one as well) If frozen over night they can be used again but it should be within 24-48 hours, we pushed it a week and they did not reuse as well. <end>  Glowsticks  Used them for wedding send off - both adults and kids loved them whether as sticks to wave or bangles to wear. Kids showed adults how to use them. Not as blue in photos as I expected. In person, a beautiful effect for a low price. Do not handle before you are ready to use them, there is a possiblity of breaking/activating one or two before you need them. (Educational only if adult discusses atoms, energy, light etc.) <end>  Glowsticks  These work great, they last a long time, and the colors are very vibrant. The only issue I had was it took a week longer than I expected to get the order - be sure to give yourself extra time (a week or so) if you are buying these for a specific event. The order actually arrived on the end day of the "will arrive between X and Y", but that meant I got it almost 10 days after the earliest time that they indicated (X and Y were 10 days apart). <end>
 B000IZBI1W  Football Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  A must buy for your football loving spouse!  My husband loves his sports and football is one of those sports when everything comes alive. When I saw these I just had to get them for him. They go well with any type of shirt and look really sporty! He loves them! <end>  Great gift for a football fan!  I bought these for a friend of mine that LOVES football. They are nice and heavy, not cheap and hollow as I thought they may be. I think these would make a great gift for anyone that uses cufflinks and loves football! <end>
 B000IZCTRO  Wine Corkscrew Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Cheap and flimsy  I think the title says it all. These are little better than toys, and I do not expect them to last more than one or two uses. <end>
 B000IZEJOA  Black Enamel Masonic Compass & Set Gold-Tone Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  just beautiful  This was really worth the money. It is simple and beautiful. Bought it for my father who is a mason and I know he will like it. They are high quality and came in a really nice case. So it is perfect for gift giving. <end>
 B000IZEJRW  Gambler Deck of Cards Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Poker+Cufflings  It was one of the best love gift this past Chrismas. My husband was obsessed with poker at that time, and he loves cufflings. <end>
 B000IZEJY0  Ace of Spades Playing Cards Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Gravy baby...  I purchased these for a wedding. Cuff Daddy made me look like a big papa, thanks. i would recommend these and purchase from them again. <end>  Sweet Accent for the Card Players Suit!!!!  Love these cufflinks. Purchased them for my wedding as a little personal accent since I'm such a big poker player and they look great! <end>  Great cuff links  These cuff links worked perfectly for my husband on our wedding day. Great little touch of personality for the wedding. <end>  Nice  While I've only worn them once so far, they seem built well, nice looking, and functional. They come in a nice little box that's worth keeping for storage. <end>
 B000IZQM5O  Sardelli - 14kt Gold Polished Sand Dollar Post Earrings ||	  Very Small  These are nicely made but much smaller than I thought they would be. They almost disappear in your ear. Luckily the necklace I bought them to wear with is also smallish. <end>
 B000IZSLWQ  Sardelli - 14kt Gold Polished Thread Of Gold Tube Earrings ||	  Pretty, but small and fragile.  Pros  These earrings are very petite and pretty. They're highly polished so it sparkles in the light, and they're lightweight so you don't even feel them when they're on. They're in 14k gold, which is always a plus for me since all of my other jewelry is of that purity.Cons  They're EXTREMELY small. The listed 3.15 inches in the specs is actually the total length of the earrings when they're unfolded. The diameter of each tube is probably 1 mm. Also, the chain connecting the two tubes is very thin (much thinner than the tubes), where the first link starting from the tube is basically as thick as a strand of hair. Because it's so thin, it's easy to bend the link so the earrings look crooked. In fact, when I first pulled the earrings out of the box, they were already bent. Also, considering the amount of gold it has (.4 g), these earrings are pretty expensive.Overall, they're pretty, but I personally would not have purchased these if I had known their actual size. They'd be a good buy for a young teen but they seem too delicate for anyone older. <end>
 B000IZU46W  Mele Suede Jewelry Box Rose 545-22 ||	  Perfect!  This is exactly what I was looking for! Easy way to store my earrings. <end>
 B000IZV7CC  14K White Gold 1/2 ct. Diamond "Journey of Love" Curve Pendant with Chain ||	  Beautiful but small  It's a beautiful pendant but the picture provided makes it look deceptively bigger than it really is. <end>
 B000IZZ2AA  Sterling Silver Open Circle Drop Earrings ||	  Nice  I bought these earrings on sale and am very pleased with them. They're pretty and do not look cheap. Please note that Amazon has posted a poor photo on their product information page. In real life, the inner and outer circles are perfectly round. The angle of the photo makes the outer circles look like skewed ovals. The finish is polished (shiny), not matte. <end>  A good choice.  These earrings have been a big hit. My wife has recieved many compliments and as a result the earrings get lots of use. A great value for the price. <end>
 B000IZZ412  Full Metal Alchemist Earring Set ||	  All stars even though it's not a toy.  These earrings are great. Easy to put in, long enough to be noticeable but not too long to become annoying to the wearer. Excellent item for those who love FMA. I just don't understand why it asks me to rate a toy! <end>
 B000IZZ6ME  8g (8 Gauge) Surgical Steel Flesh Tunnel Plug Earlet ||	  Good quality, but pay attention.  The plug is good quality, but when ordering pay attention. Only one plug is included for the price. <end>
 B000J013BQ  Sterling Silver Open Circle Drop Earrings ||	  Nice Design!  A nice twist on a circle design. The quality is solid on these silver open circle drop earrings. I have received many compliments! <end>
 B000J02GVW  Sterling Silver Open Circle Flower Pendant ||	  Nice pendant, a little bigger than a quarter. Buy another silver or leather chain.  Pendant is nice, shining sterling silver. It just a teeny bit bigger than a quarter and is raised in the middle. Looks nice, not too funky but neither too traditional and can be worn with anything from casual jeans to business casual. The chain is light and totally useless for me as it doesn't seem to be more than 16". For a kid or a tween it would be the right length. I am going to wear it with my other silver chains. It also looks nice strung in a mauve or black leather chain that I have for more casual wear. I bought it on the 50 percent off sale in the gold box deals. I wouldn't have liked to pay more as I've seen really cool sterling silver pendants with chain at TJMaxx and wonders of wonders even Walmart for under fifteen dollars. <end>  What you see is what you get...  This piece is very difficult to review. You will open the pouch, and be neither disappointed nor excited. The design is lovely, and if the craftsmanship were a little better, I would have more to say. The groves in the flower are very shallow, giving the necklace an overall flat look. It is a nice piece, but something more appropriate for a young teenager than an adult. <end>  shinny and beautiful  the size of hte pendant is the same as a quater coin.Beatiful ! <end>  Very pretty  This is a very nice sized piece and I like that you can adjust the length of the chain a little. Very pleased with it. <end>  Great Silver Pendant  This is a beautiful pendant for the price, though I changed the chain (which is too slight for the size of the pendant). I get constant compliments on this lovely piece! <end>  Just Satisfied  The product looks exactly the same as it is in the picture. The quality is good, but the chain is very thin. <end>  flower pendant  This pendant is lovely! If you happen to be a flower lover (my #1 theme in the jewelry I buy with hearts coming in second) you will want to add this to your collection. The chain is sturdy enough and the price is very reasonable. Needless to say, I am very happy with this purchase. <end>  Cute  Pretty pendant for the price. The chain is very light but the pendant itself is nice and hangs well. <end>  Great buy!  This is one of my wife favorites. It has stood up well over the past 6 months or so. It is obviously a great value! <end>  Nice  Purchased this on the Gold Box sale. Pleased with the pendant. The chain is too light and too short for my tastes. Will replace with a sturdier, longer, chain. <end>  Gorgeous!  What a surprise when I opened the pretty blue velveteen bag! A shiny pendant that received many, many compliments when worn to a wedding! Thanks! <end>  Nice!  I love this necklace and I have received several compliments on it! I can't add any more to this review. <end>  smaller than I pictured  This is a pretty, small necklace. Only about 1 1/2" across in diameter, but very shiny. The chain was quite short too, but that was expected. <end>  Nice, affordable piece  For the price, this is a nice little addition to any collection. It's a decent size, and looks nice with just about anything. The chain is slightly lacking, but isn't too horrible considering the cost of the piece. I would recommend this as a gift to someone who loves sterling silver. <end>  Beautiful pendant!  I purchased this necklace for $9.99. I love the pendant. It is a nice weight and size. A friend loved it so much that she wanted one, too. However the $9.99 price was for only one day. (We're both frugal.) The chain was about what I expected after reading the reviews. It does seem to be shorter than the 18 inches advertised, and it is kind of fine. This is the only reason for four stars instead of five. I put the pendant on my own silver chain. <end>  chain to weak looks cheap  like the neckelace except for the chain on another chain it would look nice, but the chain is to weak and looks cheap <end>
 B000J03NKU  10k Yellow Gold Citrine & Diamond Circle Pendant, 18" ||	  Beutiful  I love it. This piece of jewelry will be worn frequently. I had it less then two days and have already had comments on it. <end>
 B000J0HPLS  Bold Emerald cut Citrine & Diamond Pendant - JewelryWeb ||	  AMAZING!  This pendant/necklace is even more beautiful than what the picture shows. The quality is beyond the price, which I consider well below it's value. Extremely happy! <end>
 B000J0PSYY  Chinese brocade jewelry roll with ring holder - assorted colors ||	  Pretty with mediocre zippers  I received a very pretty red brocade jewelry roll. I like having the large open pocket as well as the zip pockets, so this roll can handle several sizes of necklaces. The snap holding the ring bar is good, but the zippers are a bit sticky and have to be handled gently. <end>
 B000J1QROI  Clearly Charming December Blue Zircon Color Girl Child Baby Birthstone Italian Charm ||	  AWesome  Received this for my niece for a Christmas gift and it was perfect. She loved it and I had it in enought time for the holidays. <end>
 B000J27JLM  MEDICAL ID BRCLT-DIABETIC Size  ~ ||	  Disappointing  I bought this brand new bracelet to give away FREE to my indigent patients. But I was totally disappointed and I can't even show it to them,so embarrassing. I ordered 16 pcs. all the clasp were tarnished and the edges of the plate were rough. I guess this is what we pay for cheap price. <end>
 B000J2KWC0  Sterling Silver Blue CZ Vintage Style Ring ||	  I love this ring  This ring is awesome & very proportional. So many times when you buy rings online they are gaudy and way bigger than the picture. This ring is pretty and I love it. <end>
 B000J2KWHU  Sterling Silver Single-Row Turquoise Stone Ring ||	  Excellent for price  This is a solid, beautiful ring. The stones are a beautiful color & high quality. If I were to buy this ring in a store I would expect to pay at least 40.00. I would recommend this ring. The photo doesn't do it justice. <end>  i would buy if...  I would love to buy 2 or 3 of these rings and stack them together!! Too bad that would bring the total to $60. I would buy if they were less priced! <end>
 B000J2KXLU  Silver .925 Oval Red stone CZ Baguette Ring Size 10 ||	  Not quite as nice as expected...  I purchased this for my wife. She had purchased a peridot version of this ring in Santa Barbara on a weekend getaway with her aunt and LOVES IT! When she found this one in red online, she was very excited and asked for it for her birthday. When it arrived, she was disappointed. Even though it costs about the same as the one she purchased in Santa Barbara and the picture is practically identical (just a different color CZ), it looks a lot cheaper in person. Our daughter says it looks like something you'd get from a machine. The sizing runs big, too, so it slides around on her biggest finger. <end>
 B000J2KXRY  .925 Silver Midnight Black Enamel CZ Flower Ring S10 ||	  Love it!  This item having a black background really looks great. I wear a good deal of black, and it goes with everything. Good buy, good price, gets a very good rec from me. <end>
 B000J2KYGY  Silver .925 GENUINE PERIDOT oval Bali Bead Ring Size 6 ||	  FANTASTIC! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  I absolutely loved the ring I received as a gift so I went to their site and ordered several items from Silver Speck as gifts for my friends who are also August birthdays, hence the Peridot.Silver Speck offers high-quality jewelry a very low prices and has tremendous customer service. When I had a slight problem with an order, Silver Speck did not hesitate a second to rectify the problem and I am totally pleased with their products and their customer service. I highly recommend this vendor and this item.Sherri <end>  Peridot Ring  This ring is smaller than I thought it would be. The stone is pretty, but the silver is pretty thin and flimsy. I would not have bought this ring if I had known it would look as cheap as it does. <end>  Very Pretty!!  Sparkly, dainty, wear it with casual or dressy clothing, matches anything green. I love it. <end>  Nana  This ring represents itself well. It is of substantial weight and the stone is very pretty. It is just like the picture. I would reccommend you buy this ring if you like peridot. It is also at a fabulous price. <end>
 B000J2KYM8  Silver .925 Simulated CZ Mens Pave Ring Size 10 ||	  Not satisfied  This ring was tarnished within two weeks of my husband wearing it. Where it was once silver it is now brown. <end>
 B000J2L4OU  Sterling Silver Genuine Rose Quartz Chip Stretch Ring ||	  Rose Quartz Ring is Pretty but Does Not Contain Silver  When purchasing several (7) of these at an excellent price, the description contained "sterling silver," this product, however, is not strung with silver nor does it contain any sterling silver separators. The ring is attractive, but not very practical nor comfortable when worn as a ring. It is, however, quite versatile and can be used in a variety of ways to either glean the benefits of the stone (if you believe in such things,) or to simply add an attrative accent. I would not, however, had purchased so many if I had known that they did not contain silver as described.While I did not receive a response from SilverSpeck, in their defense, we all make mistakes and they do offer a variety of affordable and attractive products. <end>
 B000J2M3PE  Purple Enamel Silver Heart Ring Simulated Diamond S10 ||	  Not at all this color  the ring that I got doesn't look ANYTHING like this picture...the enamel portion is BEIGE..the stone in the middle is a flat brownish/pink color..there is nothing PURPLE on this ring and it looks NOTHING, NOTHING NOTHING like this picture...very disappointing as I purchased to wear w/ a bridesmaid dress and this certainly will not work....what a drag... <end>
 B000J2O5PK  Sterling Silver Pink & Clear CZ Ring ||	  Pink CZ  This ring was not the prettiest I have seen---the stone was dark and smaller than I expected and the ring was a small 10. Ir was a pretty well-made piece--- did not keep it---I gave it to a student. She liked it though. <end>
 B000J2O64A  Sterling Silver Three Stone Coral Ring ||	  pink coral inlay  i own this ring, would love it in different colors. am really please with it. <end>
 B000J2O668  Silver CITRINE YELLOW cz Simulated Diamond Ring Size 10 ||	  Gorgeous  Gorgeous design and very nicely made with nice coloring to the stones and good detail in the setting. Great value for the price and Definately recommend this ring to anyone who likes bigger rings. Seller shipped fast and packaged arrived early. <end>
 B000J2O6CM  Sterling Silver Tri color Flower Ring Size 7 ||	  ...  PRETTY LITTLE RING. LIGHT WEIGHT. WILL NOT MAKE A STATEMENT BUT EASY GOING. DOES NOT CATCH ON CLOTH AND CAN BE WORN WITH ANY METAL CAUSE HAS ALL 3 COLORS. IT IS WORTH THE PRICE. <end>
 B000J2O708  Silver DANGLING Heart Cross Coral Onyx Ring 7 ||	  This is not genuine Onyx!!!!  False advertising, this is not Onyx, I verified this with a jeweler and it even looks like some kind of plastic or epxy. I own Onyx and it looks and feels nothing like it very obvious. I guess I should not have expected mych for the price but again issue after issue with ordering jewelry thru Amazon from every single seller and vendor. In the photo the black looks inset into the cross, it's not. It's actually glued on the top of it.... another let down. <end>  LOVE THIS LITTLE RING  THIS IS A CUTE LITTLE RING FOR THE THUMB OR PINKIE STONES ARE VERY NICE WORTH THE PRICE!! <end>
 B000J2PZWW  Sterling Silver Multi Gemstone Stackable Ring Set ||	  LOVE THEM!  I love this ring set. They look great worn together, or seperately. The rings are feminine, but also incredibly durable. They have a very nice weight to them. I would definitly buy again from this seller. <end>  Heavy and beautiful, but....  I received these rings very quickly and I loved them IMMEDIATELY. They are very heavy, with a quality feel to them, and they are super comfortable to wear, very smooth. BUT, that evening (the first day!) I looked down at them and noticed a stone had already fallen out somewhere! I am hugely disappointed, to say the least. Not sure if I want to try again. Haven't contacted the company yet, but hopefully they will send me a refund or a new ring. <end>  pretty but, purple stone is very very light in color  it's ok. found something similar at red envelope but, they were out of stock. had hoped this would be a little "more." <end>
 B000J2PZXG  Sterilng Silver Blue Sapphire & CZ Ring ||	  awesome ring  this ring is amazingbought it for my girlfriend as a gift and she LOVES itsapphires a bit darker than shown in photo, but brilliant blue when held under a lightall around beautiful ring, arrived within 3 days, very pleased with this purchase <end>  Great ring at a great price!  This is a great product that was received quickly and was just as beautiful in person as in the picture. It's a Christmas gift and I was pleased that I chose this product. <end>  Beautiful  This ring came so quickly. It arrived 3 days after I purchased it and it fits perfectly (size 5 on my ring finger). The diamonds are slightly darker than the picture but walking around in the sun today made all of the gems sparkle. The pave setting is low and doesn't hit any surfaces or snag my clothes. It is so unique and different from any other ring I've seen and I've already fallen in love with it. Great service and a beautiful ring. <end>  absolutely stunning  I have been always hesitant to purchase jewelry via the net ---- checking to see what's available versus retail, I decided to give it a try trusting Amazon for reliability and convenience and safety of ordering. My husband has been wanting to buy me a ring for our 46th anniversary and we just couldn't find anything in our price range in stores.So, I searched and found this ring --- it is stunning. I feared the sapphires would be pale and artificial looking; they are just the opposite ----- the ring fit perfectly (size 8 - I usually need 7-1/2)and it reflects light beautifully. A perfect complement as a special ring. Silver Speck delivered the ring within a few days after ordering - I received it on Christmas Eve !! Thank you Silver Speck for elegance and fine design. <end>  lovely  I really love my blue sapphire ring. The color really stands out. I have gotten alot of compliments and i am very happy with this product. Also, I got a few blue sapphire earrings to match my ring. <end>  Beautiful ring  Beautiful ring, very sparkly and belivable. Stones are darker than on the picture. Love it! True to the size, matches with my earings <end>  It's ok  It was a little bit bulky and ornate for my style. The stones also seemed to be set rather precariously in the prongs, so I'm always worried about losing one. When I wear this, I feel like I'm wearing an out-of-date heirloom, only without the sweet backstory to go with it. <end>  disappointed  received this today. 2 prongs were completely broken off and 1 already cracked. stones were crooked. other than that, it was a beautiful ring, but i am returning as it is visably noticable of the damage to the ring with a great risk that the stones will soon fall out. don't know if this is due to shipping or company's standard control. <end>
 B000J2Q00I  Sterling Silver Turquoise Inlay Dome Shaped Ring ||	  Pretty  Very pretty piece. The design is a little large so be sure you know which finger it's going on before you buy it. I was going for a size 7 to go on my middle finger and while the size was correct the overall ring was kinda big for me. Made an awesome gift for a larger friend though. <end>
 B000J2Q0JY  Sterling Silver Blue & Clear CZ Ring ||	  Not what it seems  Although it is difficult to get a good picture of how this ring looks given that you can only see it from one angle, the blue color of the stone is much darker in real life, and it doesn't resemble any tanzanite stones I have seen. Plus it is an emerald cut not a princess cut, if that matters to you. I wouldn't buy this ring, unless you are sure you want it because no shipping costs are refunded. <end>
 B000J2Q18E  PINK Emerald cut Simulated Diamond Heart Silver Ring S7 ||	  This ring is so beautiful!  This pic does not do this ring justice, it is so beautiful! Mine has also seen it's share of getting hit against shelves at work, and has really held up well! I love mine! <end>
 B000J2Q1Z2  Silver GENUINE GARNET stone twist border Ring Size 6 ||	  Great Ring. Right Price  This was a gift for my daughter, her birthstone. The ring looks great, quality is very good and my daughter loves it. Shipping was inexpensive and it arrived in just a few days. <end>
 B000J2Q1ZM  Sterling Silver Genuine Lapis Oval Ring ||	  Packaged very poorly...  Unfortunately, when I received this ring in the mail, not only was the silver bent (so the ring was at a weird angle), but the lapis stone had fallen out. The ring was packaged very poorly and the ring suffered for the mistake that was made. <end>
 B000J2UO0U  Forzieri Florentine Fleur-de-Lis Silver Plated Cufflinks ||	  Love the Links!  These cuff links have a nice antiqued look to them, which is just what we wanted. The expedited shipping was fast, as requested, and the presentation boxes were great and really made the gift! <end>
 B000J34ECS  Sterling Silver Live Laugh Love Open Circle Inspirational Sentiment Pendant on 16in Shotbead Chain ||	  Pendant  It's okay. Not bad enough to return, but not what I was expecting. It's slightly bigger than I wanted. It's very thin. It looks cheap to me.One of the problems of shopping online for this type of item. You need to be able to see in person.The chain broke before it was even unwrapped. I was't planning on using that chain anyway, so no big deal. I would have been upset if I was planning on using - but it probably would have broke on the first wear!This pendant is going to my 10-year old niece. I don't care if she loses it. <end>  Better then expected  This was better then i expected, When u look at the chain here it looks like the crapy ones that comes w/ toys, but its not... its made from sterling silver and the little balls are not completely sphericle, they hv different faces which makes the chain shine alot !!! the "halo" thing is also made from sterling silver and it leeks better then on the picture... will recommend !!!! better product then i expected !!! <end>  A Tad Delicate  As usual, shipping from SkyeSterling was great. Never had a problem. The product is very beautiful but sadly a tad delicate and the chain snapped when it was grabbed at by a friend while around my neck. I would still very much recommend it but not for heavy use, as I'm sure it wasn't designed for in the first place. <end>  Liked it, but tarnished easily  I bought this necklace for myself a while ago....and I don't wear it anymore, because the silver "chipped off" and tarnished. It's really disappointing. I think I threw out the charm because it disappointed me so much!Is it worth your money? I don't think so. <end>  Not very good  I bought this, and it wasn't very good. The chain is incredibly cheap and the pendant looks cheap also. That said, it still carries a good message. <end>
 B000J36X7M  Sardelli - 14k Gold Cultured Pearl Drop Earrings ||	  Pearl Drop Earrings - Sardelli  The description for this earrings should say - Children's Jewelry. So tiny and I find the quality so poor. This must be made in either China or Thailand where most cheap jewelry nowadays come from. Will learn a lesson next time. <end>
 B000J388LG  Sterling Silver Wavy Cross Pendant with 18in Magic Chain Necklace 18in ||	  Beautiful cross  This is a beautiful cross and definitely worth the money. I ordered it for my daughter for her confirmation and would recommend. It's larger than expected so wouldn't recommend for a young person; but would definitely recommend to anyone who likes silver and crosses. <end>
 B000J38N70  Sardelli - 14k Gold Cultured Pearl Dangle Earrings ||	  I loved these!  I think these are adorable... rounder than as photographed. The size is dainty, but in a good way. They seem very secure and go well with most things.Customer service was great. <end>
 B000J40UIO  10k Yellow Gold Dyed Lavender Jade Pendant, 18" ||	  Nice necklace  All in all a very nice necklace for the price. The only complaint is that the cloth for the pendant will require you to tie it to length. It did make a good Valentine's gift, though. <end>
 B000J42UNW  14k Yellow Gold Ruby Pendant, 18" ||	  Nice size and the color is outstanding  I purchased this for a friend and i was very pleased with the size. It does stand out and she loved it. The color was a deep red. The chain is very delicate. <end>
 B000J44K8K  Small Stainless Steel Anchor Stud Earrings, 3/8 inch high ||	  Great!  I love these earrings! It's a great price and the earrings are a perfect size. <end>  Great buy for anchor lovers  This was a GREAT purchase!!! I ordered these earrings for my daughter as a birthday present. She loves anything with anchors and they are absolutely perfect! They are well made and the size is just right for wearing alone or with a double piercing. They were even shipped in a nice little box for gift giving. They also shipped quickly. My daughter was totally surprised that I found anchor earrings and is thrilled with them. We are both totally satified....and no I don't work for the company. Its really nice to get a great gift at a decent price! <end>  Picture is misleading  The picture of this product is misleading. What I received the posts were on the bottom instead of onto and they are more a greyish metal and not the pretty silver.The shape was even different. They looked horrible on the ears as well. <end>  Cute  These earrings are very cute and dainty. I have metal sensitivity, and these are perfect and a very cheap alternative to gold. <end>
 B000J4DCW0  Silver Pink Flower HEART CHARM Pendant ITALY ||	  CUTE CHARM  This charm is cuter in person than it is on the blurry pic that's posted for the item description. I purchased this charm to attach it to my charm bracelet. It's the first one of many. I am very happy with my purchase! <end>
 B000J4DDH4  Sterling Silver Filigree Marcasite Garnet Cross Necklace, 18" ||	  Garnet cross locket  The craftsmanship on the product is superb. It is very detailed and exquisate in design. However the picture on the site appears quite large, and in actual size the locket is smaller than the picture makes it out to be. It is still very beautiful though and worth the buy. <end>  lovely detailing  I fell in love with this locket the first time I saw it on Amazon months ago. I finally broke down and bought it for myself and am well pleased with the piece. It has a good weight to it and the detailing makes it look like something that has been handed down from generation to generation. I've gotten compliments on it from strangers. The only drawback I can possibly see is that the open filigree on the front of the locket would render it less than water resistant if you accidentally leave it on while showering or swimming. Any keepsake stored inside could possibly get wet. <end>  Beauty  I got this necklace for a friend's birthday and she LOVED it. Especially because it's a locket. It's kind of gothic-feminine, which is exactly what I was looking for. Craftmanship was great; no complaints here! <end>  My mom loved it  I gave this locket to my mom last christmas and she loved it. It looks much nicer in real life than in the picture.My aunt wants one now too. <end>  Beautiful locket  This locket is breathtaking! It's really intricate, and feels solid as well, nothing flimsy about it. It measures 32 x 19mm and if you look at it sideways it measures almost 1.5cm at the widest. Despite its size, it has a solid weight to it. It doesn't have a flat back, it's rounded so when you have it on a chain around your neck it can flip about quite often. The front too, is rounded. However, because of its design, it means that there is ample room inside for more than just a photo. I can fit a few small gemstone chips and a very small gemstone tumblestone inside. The garnet is really genuine. It does have an open filigree design so please be careful when you have a photograph inside because if you never take off your necklace when you shower or swim (like me) you'll get it wet. There's no latch to open the locket so you need to use your nail to open it.I truly adore it. It has an old world feel to it, like an antique jewelry my grandmother passed down to me. I saw another review on another site that described this locket as gothic feminine and it describes this locket perfectly! Love it... I actually find myself working around my wardrobe to show off this necklace!As a side note, the photos on this website isn't very accurate. It is FAR more beautiful in person. Definitely get this, you won't regret it. <end>  A great piece of jewelry.  I purchased this item for my mother for christmas. I took baby pictures of myself and my little sister, I am 25 she is 21, and placed them into the locket. It was a beautiful piece and holds a very nice sized face shot. My mother loved it. The top protion is see through. I backed one of the photos with a purple colored page and the stone looked really nice and it hid the white backside of the picture. It also arrived in perfect timing. <end>  Just what the doctor ordered  I bought this for my wife's birthday. She loves the locket and enjoys the garnet setting (her birthstone). The seller shipped this product within a day or two, also included a pouch and plastic bag for protection. I would buy from the seller again, that's for sure. <end>  Beautiful Vintage Style Locket  This was my second purchase from this company and it was another good one.Their lockets are of good quality for the money. This locket is no exception andis truly lovely, it really captures the spirit of vintage detail and craftsmanship.The locket is sturdy and has a heavy weight to it. It is not a cheap peice of jewelryand is sure to delight any fan of this style of vintage. A beautiful locket at a reasonableprice. The chain is somewhat comical and fragile. I put mine on a 16 inch box chainfor a much better look and support (a 16 or 18 inch box chain looks much better than whatit comes with). As long as your willing to use a nicer chain this is a win, win purchase.You really are just buying the locket from this company as one reviewer so accuratelystated. <end>  Beautiful  My brother's mother in-law LOVES marcasite, and with her being a first time grandmother, this was the perfect gift since it is a locket. The picture does not do this piece justice. It is gorgeous and the locket hinge is sturdy and easy to open. I highly recommend this necklace. She loves it! <end>  I love my new Locket  I am very glad I decided on this locket. I just recieved it in the mail and I am in love with it. It is very pretty and isn't cheap feeling. It is a heavier locket and I think that is great, it feels like I actually have something on my neck. The only thing I noticed is that the garnet on the front sticks out a little farther than I thought it would but that isn't a complaint as much as something I have just noticed. All in all I love this locket and I think that anyone looking into this locket would be glad to wear it. I most definately recoment this as a presant to someone special or just a gift to ones self. You will love it! Also I am glad it came with a chain, I wasn't sure it would. <end>   )  The chain that comes with the locket is of a very poor quality. Make sure that you have your own chain to put it on. The locket itself is beautiful. It feels heavy in your hand. I have not noticed any opening/shutting issues that were mentioned in other reviews. The back of this locket is not as decorative as the front, it is very smooth and shiny on the back. That doesn't bother me, but I thought it might bother some of you. Overall I am very satisfied. <end>  LOVE IT!!  I absolutely loved the garnet locket! My birth stone is garnet and I was looking for something that had it. The vintage looking locket looks great with so many things and I love this purchase. <end>  Nice necklace for the money.  You get what you pay for. This is a decent necklace. The chain is very cheap and the locket feels a little loose when you open it. Other than that it looks nice on. All in all it's decent for the price. I bought it as a gift for someone and it (of course) looks much better here then when I got it in person but it will still nice enough. It's only $30, and I'd say it's worth that. <end>  Antique looking simple locket  I love it so much; it's simple, eye catchy and has an antique look. It delivered within very short time. <end>  marcasite locket  the locket is nice very pretty. the cheap necklace it comes on is bad. <end>  No Subject  Very beautiful locket, my cousin liked it so much she cried when I gave it to her. The only fault I see with it is that it has a hard time staying closed. Other than that - Very happy. <end>  very pleased  The locket arrived within one week, instead of the 2-3 estimated, so it was a pleasant surprise in the mail. Nicely packaged in a plastic slip and small bag. The locket has a nice weight to it - just enough so you know it's there. I was very pleased to see it looks just like the picture shows. Comes with a basic chain tht you may eventually want to replace. If you're looking for something with an old, almost medieval feel, than this locket is well worth it. <end>  The chain was broken when it arrived, otherwise the pendant was beautiful.  Although the pendant itself if very pretty, the chain was broken when it arrived. The chain is very delicate (cheap), so it was a good thing I ordered it because of the pendant and not the chain. Would I purchase it again, probably not. I'd rather pay for a good piece than receive a cheap chain - I can get my own chain if necessary. <end>  Nice necklace  I sent this to my mom in Florida. She loves it and has enjoyed showing it off to her friends! <end>  wrong stone  The medal work is very nice but the stone is pink not red. I was going to give it as a birthday gift to a January birthday but the fact that it isn't a garnet I don't know what yo do with it. <end>  Beautiful Locket  I am so happy with this locket. It is beautiful. It is just what I needed to hold something very important to me. <end>  Love it!  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she mentioned that she wanted a locket. This is a beautiful locket that she loved! I did buy a longer silver chain for it because she wanted more than an 18&#34; chain but definitely worth the money. <end>  Good Deal!  Girlfriend loved it! Thanks for the fast service too! Just in time for Christmas and was suprisingly simple to do. <end>  Very pretty, good product for the money  The locket itself is very pretty. It's a good weight and looks a bit vintage. The chain is cheap and does not match very well with the locket like some of the other reviews stated. Also just FYI, both the front and the back of the locket are see through. Neither side is solid so in order to put a photo in it, you would need some sort of backing. Its still a very pretty piece and I am satisfied with it. I would suggest purchasing a better chain and consider using the locket for small trinkets rather than photos. <end>  Beautiful  It is polished, and catches the light well. Very pretty locket. I bought this locket for my daughter. I also have another one coming in another color for my other daughter. I am excited to give them to them for Christmas. This one is a little different then the one in the picture. The one that arrived has the open back design. I did want the closed back for more protection of the picture I place inside. However, it is so pretty I do not mind the switch. <end>  cross necklace 9gift)  it is just as it appears in picture , it is a Christmas gift so we have not worn it yet <end>  Pleased the wife!  My wife loves this necklace. Personally, I am completely ignorant about such things, but this was definitely a lucky guess. <end>  Very pretty locket  This is a very nice locket. The clasp is nice and secure. The chain was rather flimsy, so I had to purchase a new one, but overall, I am very pleased with this item. It comes in a nice pouch as well. <end>  Beautiful locket; exceeded expectations  I purchased this locket as a gift for a family member and after opening it, had second thoughts about keeping it for myself.  ) It has a lovely weight to it and is distinctive enough to be eye-catching without being overly flashy. The size is perfect and the chain it comes with was better quality than I was expecting. The recipient loves it and now wears it daily. <end>  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED  IT WAS VERY INEXPENSIVE LOOKING AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID. I DID NOT GIVE IT AS A GIFT. IT WAS REALLY THAT BAD. <end>
 B000J4DIDI  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Filigree Cross Pendant ||	  Absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!  This cross is incredibly pretty. The tiny diamonds and diamond-cutting of the silver catch the light so amazingly. To put it simply, when I wore it to my mom's house, she said, "I know what I'd like for Mother's Day." When I very innocently asked what, she said, "THAT!" and pointed to my cross. I was worried that it might be too large, based on the picture, but it wasn't. The cross is almost exactly one inch long (a little over an inch and a quarter with the bale). It looks like I paid more than the $19.99 I paid for it. It's absolutely beautiful. <end>
 B000J4DIQK  Sterling Silver Past Present and Future Genuine Sapphire Pendant ||	  Fantastic gift  I bought this birthstone pendant for one of our Granddaughters and intend to write a letter to go with this gift.This way we can tell her 1. The Past, when she was born,how proud we were,2. The Present, how smart and beautiful she is, and,3. The future, letting her know that she is to follow her heart,remembering what she was taught, love her family, and she willsucceed in all her endeavors. <end>
 B000J4DKHM  Sterling Silver White and Black Stone Lady Cameo Pendant ||	  Georgous pendant!!  This necklace will quickly become one of my favorite jewelry pieces. It is well-made and the stone work is beautiful. Nice weight, but not too heavy. The included chain is a good length, as the cameo may be worn with other longer pieces. <end>
 B000J4DKP4  Sterling Silver Genuine Azurite Stone Bali Beaded Circle Pendant ||	  Petite, Tasteful, Mysterious  What I saw was what I got! The sample pendant was beautifully presented in an antique-looking base. The azurite was the prevalent mineral with swirls of turquoise. The finish was shiny and protective. Didn't care for the chain, but I was after the pendant and wasn't disappointed. <end>
 B000J4DKSQ  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Lace Agate Stone Beaded Oval Pendant ||	  very pretty  This pendant is very pretty. And heavier than I expected. I have worn it with everything from a t-shirt to a dressy suit. <end>  Jewelrified  I was surprised by the color of this necklace when I got it. Instead of the moonstone-looking color it has a light purple color to it. The stone itself has lines across it that is typical of blue lace agate. I love how unusual the silver around it is too. This pendant comes with the necklace included. It is light enough in weight to be worn comfortably all day. Blue lace agate is useful in spiritual work by helping to protect you, improve optimism, positive thinking, hope, patience, and peace just to name a few. This is a great necklace but don't judge the stone color based on the picture. <end>
 B000J4DL3A  Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Genuine Blue Topaz Elephant Pendant ||	  BEAUTIFUL  this product was better than i expected. it was perfect because i was looking exactly for an elephant pendant with a topaz stone. i gave it as a gift and the person loved it. definitely recommend this. <end>
 B000J4DL8K  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Heart Filigree Locket Pendant ||	  Excellent Quality  I purchased this as a gift till this day about three years later it is in perfect condition as it arrrived. Has not chnaged color. The filigree is beautiful. <end>
 B000J4DMS4  Sterling Silver 4mm Genuine Smokey Quartz Stone Bead Beaded Dangle Hook Earrings Stretch Bracelet Necklace 15-19" Jewelry Set ||	  Very Nice  This was a pretty set. Would have liked it to come in a box but it came in a little ziplock baggie. Kind of lame. But I wrapped it up nicely and she liked it <end>
 B000J4DN10  Sterling Silver Murano Glass Red Oval Millefiori Bracelet Earrings and Necklace Jewelry Set ||	  Cute, but beads are flat not round like a ball  This set is cute, but the beads are flat like a nickel, not round like a ball. I was expecting beads shaped like a ball so I was a little disappointed when I saw they were flat. <end>
 B000J4DNA6  Sterling Silver and Dark Blue Bead Toe Ring ||	  Sterling Silver?  This toe ring is exactly as pictured and fits beautifully on your toes with one draw back, I found that this particular toe ring is NOT sterling silver as listed. Most sterling silver is 925 grade but this toe ring is NOT.In fact after just one day of wearing, by night I found the toe ring had turned my skin a green-blue color, resembling a bruise. This only happens when the metal is not genuine sterling silver.Buyer beware! <end>
 B000J4DPK4  Sterling Silver Designer Venetian Link Bracelet 7 ||	  Thanks but no thanks  The bracelet is nice, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I was trying to replace a stolen Venetian Link Bracelet and the links are a little bigger than I had thought. Not a big deal, I'll get used to it, trying to replace something can be hard. The length was a little weird too, I never thought I'd need the 8 inch since I don't feel like I have big wrists. I was wrong. Oops. It's a little tight, but I can deal with that.The issue I had was that when I initiated a return I got NO response. That made me MAD. I would have exchanged it for the larger one, but I never got contacted and frankly I'm a bit of a bum and missed my deadlines with Amazon to fix it. All that did is leave me annoyed and bitter that I didn't follow up. All in all, it's a pretty bracelet, but the lack of service means I won't buy from them again. <end>  BEAUTIFUL Bracelet  I bought this gorgeous venetian link bracelet several months ago and wore it everyday, bathing in it and washing dishes. It is shiny sterling silver .925 stamped and looks much prettier than its Tiffany counterpart. <end>
 B000J4DPO0  Sterling Silver .925 Five Strand Chain Bracelet 7 inch ||	  Didn't Look Right  I like the idea of this bracelet, and it looked pretty in the box, but I didn't like the way it looked on my wrist. To get it to look right I had to twist it before the clasp was fastened and it was just too hard to do. Also one of the chains was longer than the others and the excess stuck out. I returned it. <end>
 B000J4DPUO  18K Gold Over Sterling Silver 1mm Snake Chain Necklace 14" 16" 18" 20" 24" 30" ||	  beautiful chain, great price  Bought it for my graduation class pin, which can also be a pendant. Lovely, and I can get it in just the right length for dir cheap! <end>  Nice heavy chain  This is a heavy chain so will hold a relatively large pendant. I would definitely consider buying from this company again. <end>  dnt buy!!!  I will keep the review simple and straight to the point...the chain is not worth buying. I bought it and it turned grey in a week and a half. It looks great but tarnishes quickly. Purchase it at your own expense. <end>  Nice chain for a cheap price.  This chain is pretty nice for the price that you are paying and it definitely feels like it won't break with daily use. It's kind of a darker shade of yellow gold than I expected, but great overall.One unfortunate thing is that if you fold the chain in half for easier storage, the chain kind of keeps that curvature, but not too much. If that's confusing, think of in-ear wires and how they're always tangled and curled up. And again, it's not as bad as it may seem. Once you wear it, you don't notice it. <end>  Love it  I love the neckless thanks I have already ordered another thanks for such a easy sale. <end>  Pretty but catches hair  I like the price, and the chain looks lovely, but my hair gets caught and tangled in it, so until I find some solution for that, I can't really wear it very often. I have had it for months now and it has not turned green or black, and the gold did not fall off, and it did not get kinked up. It still looks as beautiful as the day I got it. It just yanks my hair out when I wear it  ( <end>  You Get What You Pay For...  The chain looked really nice.... for about a couple of weeks...Now it looks like crap! It's like the gold fell off in an instant and now it's black and silver.Don't waste your money on this one... <end>  perry  absolutely beautiful worth every penny I went and purchased one in silver great buyStunning looks very expensive I love the silver and the gold <end>  Jewelry  The chain looks like solid gold. The catch is small enough to use with smaller pendants, as well as your larger ones. <end>  Quick shipment ... less than ideal packaging  The chain's shipment was received quickly, as for the packaging to ensure a quality arrival ... well that was lacking. I had purchased two chains from this vendor and both have "bends" in them that cannot be straightened. Needless to say, I am less than thrilled with the purchases. <end>  They look good  The price was really cheap, My GF said it began to tarnish when she left it on the bathtub, and the pawn shop wouldnt give her any money for it, so its a good thing I didnt spend too much on her. Shes history. <end>  OK Necklace  First of all, don't be thinking of anything big and fancy when you get this. It comes in very thin, alomst looking like gold string. But for as thin as it is it feels very durable. The description also says it's plated over sterling silver, that means there might be possibility of it chipping later, but if you take good care of your jewerly that shouldn't happen. The quality of the gold might turn your neck green, because it is so cheap, but I don't believe it will do that.I bought this for work, needed something cheap and durable that wasn't long and couldn't snag. I like it and am buying a tiny dragon pendant to go with it.For those who do want gold but want to take the cheap route I would highly recommend this product. <end>  Necklace  Ordered a 30" necklace. Received a 30" necklace. Looks good. Was reasonably priced. Took a little longer to receive than told. Was not in a rush so that was OK. <end>  to easely bent  i took it out to look at itthen put it back in its packagingthe next time it was looked at it had started to have some small bendswhen worn it&#34;s hardly noticabletobe attractive <end>  Cheap  Necklace broke just after a day, not repairable. Wore with a locket on the end, when I bent over the necklace broke near the clasp but not the clasp itself. <end>  Excellent Customer Service  This gold chain was exactly as advertised. Unfortunately, there was a shipping problem, and when this chain arrived, it was the wrong length. There had been many problems with finally receiving the item (I was told it was in the order department), and it took twice as long to receive it. When I advised that the shipment had arrived, but was the wrong length, the company worked with me and was prompt in issuing a refund. They worked to resolve the issues and I am pleased with the final result. This chain is very pretty and if I had needed this length, I would have kept it. <end>  KInks too easily  This chain kinks (permanently) too easily, which makes it sit funny. I originally bought it to replace another chain, but I am very dissatisfied with this chain. I would not recommend this product. <end>
 B000J4DRIO  Light Blue Cats Eye Beaded Power Bracelet ||	  Quality not that great..........  I ordered from them and received the items pretty quickly. One of the bracelets I ordered was so tiny---for someone with a size 6 wrist and the beads were put on sloppily. I emailed them about it and they have not gotten back to me. I will not order from them again. Prices are great but quality is not. <end>
 B000J4DRN4  Rare Cancer Awareness Purple Genuine Swarovski Crystal Bracelet ||	  great for the price  Although simple...this bracelet is great for the price and I received the order so quickly! <end>
 B000J4DRNY  Sterling Silver Rose Link Bracelet ||	  very very small roses  This bracelet is very very small. A shame, as it is quite cute. You probably need a few to make an impact or use it with other rose bracelets or amber ones. <end>  so beautiful and delicate  I bought this for my 19 year old daughter for Christmas, she loves it! It is so beautiful and delicate, she wears it everyday and says it is her favorite piece of jewelry and she has a lot! I think I will buy it for myself also. It is well made, the only complaint I have is the lock is a little hard to put on, but on the upside it doesn't accidentally fall off either. <end>
 B000J4DRX4  Sterling Silver Genuine Diamond Accent Heart Tennis Bracelet ||	  a disappointment.  1st  the bracelet that came to me was small. 2nd  the stones in the hearts looked plastic.a friend of mine was here the day it arrived and she liked it and her wrist fit it so she took it. <end>  Cute, Dainty, Great for the price!  I was very pleased when I received this cute item...And the Price was Excellent. Not to mention it was a gift and they really enjoyed it. Thanks. <end>
 B000J4DRZW  Genuine Green Turquoise Nugget and Chip Sterling Silver Bali Bead Bracelet ||	  bitter sweet  it broke in a day. it was gorgeous and it shipped fast. it was the perfect weight but i guess not the perfect length. it was a birthday gift for a close friend and after working with it on for few hrs it broke. im so embarrassed. i wish they had posted the item with the length in addition to width. <end>  Fantastic ! SilverSpeck is amazing.  I've gotten several pieces of jewelry from SilverSpeck. I have never, never been disappointed...and at first I thought I would be! How could the items be so inexpensive and still be beautiful? Well, believe me they are!! I know I will be back at SilverSpeck many times...for myself and family! (okay,okay...mostly for myself ;)) <end>
 B000J4FCSW  Sterling Silver slide w/ bezel set round shaped Green Agate Stone ||	  pretty cool - a little modern  This is a nice green color. It's fairly modern-looking so I wouldn't recommend it if you generally wear informal stuff. It's a very nice piece for the price! <end>
 B000J4FDD6  Sterling Silver Trendy Pink, Red Coral & Turquoise Mosaic Pendant ||	  trendy sterling silver pendant  very pretty, really like it. Glad I bought it. Have had lots of comments on it. <end>  good design and good made  I was surprise, this one is good made, comparing to the similar red one.I like it. <end>
 B000J4FJH6  Joe Cool Snoopy Peanuts Italian Charm Dog Animal Theme Bracelet Link ||	  Joe Cool Snoopy Peanuts Italian Charm  Great item! I love this little charm. Snoopy is my favorite, and items of this quality with him on them are difficult to find anymore. This is one of my favorite charms. <end>
 B000J4FJPI  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Clear & Blue CZ Square Men's Cufflinks ||	  Just fabulous  these were a gift for my boyfriend and let me say I am very impressed. These cufflinks look so good on. Everyone will notice them and love them <end>  Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Simulated Diamond cz and Blue cz Pave Square Filigree Cuff Links Cufflink (Purchased on  There isn't a stockingMy sum is recovered <end>
 B000J4FK52  Sterling Silver Marcasite & Turquoise Diamond Shaped Locket ||	  Sterling silver locket  This locked was on a wish list and purchased as a gift for my daughter. It is as described and I am sure she will not be disappointed. <end>  She loved it.  I got this for my girlfriend for our anniversary. She loves torquise and silver. I was going to get her a traditional heart shaped locket, but after seeing this I actually changed my order. <end>  My girlfriend loved it  Very nice looking piece. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's hard to tell from the front, but it's rather fat in profile. It could have been a little slimmer and still held a photograph. Also, the chain provided it rather small for the size of the locket. Otherwise it's a great peice. My girlfriend loved it! <end>
 B000J4FK66  Sterling Silver Simulated Emerald & CZ Dragonfly Pendant ||	  Just right  Great value for the price. Well made with really nice color stones. Lots of sparkle and a nice size. Not to small and not to big.... Just right. <end>
 B000J4FM8W  Sterling Silver Genuine Diamond Accent Garnet Stone Cross Pendant ||	  Lovely!  I bought this for my roommate whose birthstone is garnet. She loves garnets, so she actually wears this necklace practically every day, and as far as I know, it has never broken or chipped or anything. She's had it for almost two months now.It's a nice color of deep garnet, and the shape is nice, too. The diamonds are very small, as you can see in the picture, but they still look nice. The whole necklace is slightly smaller than I anticipated, but it is the correct listed dimensions--it's just the slightly blown up picture threw me off. Very nice piece of jewelry! <end>
 B000J4FMWS  Sterling Silver Twisted Silver Border Genuine Azurite Stone Oval Pendant ||	  TINY!  I personally do not like large pieces, but my goodness, this pendant is small!! To make matters worse, the accompanying chain looks tacky and cheap. Oh and by the way the stone I got was blue, I am not versed on azurite, but I had hoped for a green stone. <end>
 B000J4FN6I  Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Genuine Amethyst Frog Pendant ||	  Cute!  This is a beautiful little necklace. I got it for my best friend who not only loves the colour purple, but she loves frogs as well!It was delivered quickly and is exactly as described. <end>
 B000J4FP7A  Sterling Silver 8mm Genuine Onyx Stone Bead Beaded Dangle Hook Earrings Stretch Bracelet Necklace 16-19" Jewelry Set ||	  Not what it seems...  Bead size is smaller than 8mm. Took 2 months to get response from seller about how to return them. <end>
 B000J4FPG6  Sterling Silver Flower Toe Ring with Simulated Aquamarine CZ ||	  DONT BUY  A real bad buy - even if it cost as low as it cost - Still wont last for more than a month- bad experience <end>
 B000J4FRRI  Celebrity Sterling Silver Simulated Diamond CZ Classy Tennis Bracelet ||	  Beautiful Bracelet  I wanted more than a basic one row line bracelet, and this was exactly what I was looking for. The bracelet is very substantial, and the stones really sparkle. I love it. <end>
 B000J4FRXW  Sterling Silver Snake Chain Necklace 16 inch ||	  hard to fasten  This is a very pretty, standard snake chain. I love how it looks, but I think I'm going to have to hire a personal assistant just to fasten it for me. The ring just barely passes through the clasp...it actually scrapes both sides as you push it in...yeah, PUSH. At least it's an exercise in dexterity...and maybe in Zen-like patience, too. <end>  Gift for a young man (13)  This purchase was a gift. It arrived quickly, and even came in a gift pouch. I was very pleased with the chain. <end>
 B000J4FS7M  Sterling Silver X & Heart Bracelet with Genuine Diamond accents ||	  X's & hearts  I bought this to replace a bracelet that I use to own that broke. It's beautiful, and I love it! So glad I looked on Amazonand found it. I couldn't believe my luck in the beauty or the price. Thanks! <end>
 B000J4FSMW  Sterling Silver CZ Tennis Bracelet ||	  Horrible!  Though this beautiful braclet does look amazing it was made horribly!I wore this one day and by the next day it broke right in half! if you want to get a braclet like this go to Kohls because I gotA new braclet just like it from there and it's ten MILLOIN times better than this one! <end>
 B000J4FT0S  Sterling Silver Multi Color Stone Cuff Bangle Bracelet ||	  Not very good quality  I hate to give bad reviews, but I feel like I need to warn others. One of the rocks/beads fell off shortly after I got it. I'm sorry to say, it just wasn't what I expected. <end>
 B000J4FT5S  Sterling Silver Pink Coral Bali Beaded Bracelet ||	  Sterling Silver Pink Coral Bali Beaded Bracelet  This is a beautiful coral bracelet. It is very delicate looking yet it has some weight to it. There is excellent workmanship apparent on this bracelet. I am very happy with it. <end>  Ripped Off!  The bracelet I received doesn't even have a clasp on it. It's a cheap stretch bracelet! I just realized it looking for another coral bracelet! Is this even real coral? I'm going to find out! <end>  Love this one!  Very well made and delicate. Not overpowering, and looks exceptional for an elastic-type bracelet.I love it! <end>
 B000J4FTEY  Sterling Silver CZ Pave Link Necklace ||	  Love it!  Love this necklace. It is actually shorter then I thought though, it also is less blingy too. None the less , it's beautifully on me and I recommend it to my friends who always ask about it , <end>
 B000J4FTWQ  Genuine Mother of Pearl Beaded Power Bracelet ||	  Mother of Pearl bracelet  The bracelet is okay. It isn't as shiny as the one pictured in the photo. I guess I got $5 worth. It did arrive in a reasonable amount of time. <end>
 B000J4FU3Y  Sterling Silver Created Pink Sapphire and Genuine Diamond Accent San Marco Bracelet ||	  Horrible Clasp! Beautiful Bracelet  I picked this out as a gift and I loved it! I got multiple compliments on it but my biggest concern was the clasp. It easily would break open and the bracelet would just fall off (changing clothes, sleeping). Maybe I was too rough with it but it's great for the price. If they found a more reliable way to close it it'd be a five stars. <end>
 B000J4FUEI  Vintage-look Sterling Silver Created Pink Sapphire Bracelet with Genuine Diamond Accents ||	  Gorgeous!  I received this bracelet for my birthday and it is amazing! I've gotten so many compliments while wearing it and often find myself admiring it. <end>  Awesome!  Nicer than I expected. Looks like good carat weight on the stones, its heavy, not cheap. Very pleased. And I never review things, lol. <end>
 B000J4FULQ  Genuine Freshwater Cultured White Pearl 4mm Stretch Bracelet ||	  Quick, Inexpensive, and Great for Grad Presents!  The last reviewer noted how expensive it was to ship her item. I suggest purchasing a larger amount of these bracelets (they have different colors which look GREAT when worn together) so that the cost of the shipping is worth your while.Overall, this product is great. I haven't had any of mine break (yet), but with the cheap cost, even if it did break I could use these beautiful little pearls in a homemade project. The shipping time was SUPERB. I got these a day ahead of the earliest estimate.I chose to buy these as a nice graduation present for all the girls in my class, and the price was just right. But now, I'm thinking I might buy a few more just for the pearls!Hope you do to, these are great. <end>  Nice Bracelet  This is a very easy nice bracelet to own.It slips on and off when you are in a hurry.So much easier then trying to close a clasp on a bracelet!! <end>  Great until it broke!  I got this bracelet and was very excited. It came in the cutest baby blue bag. It was very pretty and the first day I wore it I got so many compliments. The next day I was in a meeting just sitting there and all of a sudden the bracelet broke and the beads went everywhere. I was very upset. Though it was not a lot of money the shipping price is unbelievable. I did not find that out until after I bought it. It is very pretty but I would not reccomend this product. <end>  teeny tiny  I recomend this for a childs gift. Its much smaller than it looks in the picture. On the plus side $8.44 ($2.49 + $5.95 shipping) for a genuine pearl bracelet isnt bad! Beware its very tiny. <end>  It's Cute  It's cute and it does go with the earrings I had planned to match them with. I don't know why the list price is $15 as it's all plastic and thin elastic. So far the elastic hasn't popped even though I've worn it many times. As several people said, the ship price is higher than the price of the item. <end>  Tiny disappointment!  I ordered several of these bracelets for gifts; but, only one bracelet had pearls that were anywhere near 4mm. The pearls were so tiny that they looked like seeds instead of pearls. I decided to return them and look for something else. Don't waste your money. <end>  Perfect little touch of class  This bracelet is small but even on a plus sized person it is more than adequate and it looks perfectly dainty and darling. I will be wearing one and my 12 year old junior bride will be wearing one and they will look great on both of us. I'm very pleased. <end>
 B000J4FUPW  Sterling Silver Genuine Sapphire Diamond Accent Tennis Bracelet ||	  Pretty, but not as high quality as expected  This bracelet is very pretty, but the metal isn't as nice or as heavy as I expected. It's an okay purchase for the price. <end>  Lovely  Took a while to arrive but when it did, it proved to be a lovely bracelet which met all my expectations <end>
 B000J4FUSE  Sterling Silver Oval Link Cable Chain Bracelet ||	  Quality - Qualit&eacute;  Much more beautiful than the picture. A nice surprise when I opened the package. A small price for great quality. Silver Speck I will recommend to my friends. I will surely make other purchases. Very good.Beaucoup plus beau que sur la photo. Une belle surprise quand j'ai ouvert le paquet. Un petit prix pour une grande qualit&eacute;. Je vais recommander Silver Speck &agrave; mes amis. Je vais srement faire d'autres achats. Tr&egrave;s bon. <end>
 B000J4FV06  Genuine Onyx Stone Chip Stretch Bracelet ||	  Black Onyx  All black, shiny stones. A nice bracelet for a few $$$. At this price, you can buy several. <end>  Affordable for the Eccentric  Looking for a cheap but interesting gift for my eccentric friend, I decided to purchase two types of stone chip stretch bracelets. The Genuine Onyx being one.It compliments my friend's wide array of trinkets, giving her another simple but interesting piece to collaborate with the others. A bit of polished stone is timelessly classy.A good purchase for the price; the shipping is more expensive than the item. Buy it on Amazon though, as other sites and stores charge a bit more for such a plain piece. <end>  REACTION  I showed these bracelets to some of the gals I work with, the onyx, the tiger eye, the lapis...end results....I just ordered 16 more for those gals. <end>  Great Gift Idea  These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit. Since they were so inexpensive, I was able to give everyone a gift. <end>  Not my favorite  I have very small wrists and the bracelet was very large. It wasn't as cute as I thought it would be and it fit awkwardly. I returned this product. I do not suggest if you have small wrists. <end>  Lovely  I'm very happy with this gemstone bracelet. I feel as though negativity is pushed away because of the gemstones!  ) it's an awesome and quite fashionable bracelet. I am one happy camper. <end>  Dull Stones  This is a nice bracelet, but the stones are very dull, not shiny like most onyx stones I have. I would actually question if it's onyx or just some kind of black chip bead. I really don't know, but I don't really care for the dullness of the stone because it doesn't match my true onyx jewelry when I try to wear them together. <end>  Beautiful Onyx stretch bracelet  Beautiful onxy stretch bracelet and fits a size 7 1/2 size wrist. Recommend to all. <end>  Nice  Chips are beautiful but it doesn't seem like it's made to wear everday. The band seems like it has streched and can break at any moment. It's still going strong but it feels like I need to wear with care. <end>  Nice compliment to the matching earrings  Purchased this with the matching earrings. Nice color, shinny stones, delicate looking and looks expensive. Comes in a nice blue pouch. <end>
 B000J4FYNU  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Peridot & Diamond Accent Rectangle Link Bracelet ||	  beautiful bracelet  I thought this was a very beautiful bracelet, gave it as a gift the recipient was very happy, looks exspensive. <end>  Lots of compliments  24k Gold Genuine Peridot with Genuine Diamond Accent BraceletThis is a beautiful bracelet. I've gotten many compliments on it. The clasp could be a little better, but so far it hasn't fallen off. I would recommend it to anyone with an August birthday.;-) <end>  Beautiful but not right size  The bracelet I received is beautiful but I ordered a size 7 and received a 7.5. I will have to pay to have it sized. <end>  I love this bracelent  I bought the other one, siler, but i need the gold because i wear a gold ring...I love this sooo very much. it is soo pretty. <end>
 B000J4FYSA  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Created Opal & Diamond Accent Vintage Bracelet ||	  Simulated Opal Bracelet  This is an absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry. The opals are simulated but look REAL. I have been complimented several times, even by my jeweler! Very well made. Good clasp. Easily worth the money it cost. Thank you. <end>  Cjay  I love it. It's heavy and feels great on the wrist. It drapes just right on me. I'm getting compliments on it. Even though they are not real opals but created, they are colorful and beautiful, and it's great fashion jewelry. This is one of my favorite bracelets now as I also love how I can wear it with gold and/or silver. Good for everyday or dressup. This is my second purchase from Silverspeck thru Amazon and love the other bracelet too. Don't hesitate. <end>  christmas gift  She was quite taken by this. It will go well with her Mother of the Bride dress for the March wedding. Thank you-- <end>  PennyinCanada  We purchased the bracelet as a gift for our daughter, to go with a opal drop earring set we bought her a couple of years ago. They look really well together & she is very happy. <end>  Great Bracelet  I love this bracelet. It has a great weight to it and the opals have more fire and color than I thought possible. I love the look and feel of vintage pieces and this has quickly become a favorite in my collection. <end>  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Created Opal & Diamond Accent Vintage Bracelet  This item was a bit of a surprise. I thought for the price that it might have been kind of tacky. Actually it looks very nice and the person I purchased it for likes it very much. I had to adjust the clasp because it would open very easily by accident. <end>  NIce Look and Feel  The bracelet has a nice heft to it and a great appearance. The only down side is that in the descriptive photo it appear neutral or to the blue spectrum and the reality is that it has a distinct green cast. Not bad just green not blue. <end>
 B000J4FZ5M  18K Gold Plated Hip Hop Iced CZ Bling Bling Men's Bracelet ||	  Good bracelet  Very good product for the money. It arrived on time as promised and I can hardly tell the difference between this and my real gold jewelry. <end>

 B000J4FZI4  Simulated Blue Turquoise Chip Heart Toggle Necklace ||	  not what it seems  The necklace is so short it barely fits around your neck and feels like its going to choke you. If it was an inch longer it would be much better. The color and style are very attractive but just too small. I gave it to my 11 year old neice and it fits her fine. <end>
 B000J4FZIO  Sterling Silver Pink Coral Bali Beaded Necklace ||	  Perfect  This necklace is beautiful, classy and simple. The color also blends nicely with many colors. I'm hoping it comes back in stock so that I can purchase another one. <end>  Pretty but small  I was surprised when I received this necklace--I totally thought the beads were larger in diameter! Although the coral beads are not as big as I had hoped, the necklace is well made and worth the money. <end>  Beautiful necklace  I gave this as a gift to my wife last Christmas, and it is as described, and even nicer looking than the picture. My wife loves the color of the coral contrasting with the silver. It seems very durable and goes well with lots of her work clothes. Not a long necklace, it's more like a choker. Definitely a good buy and great gift, especially if you have to get back in her good graces. <end>

I love Amazon....I did find a ring to match on the other site as on here i only found one with pink CZ's. So yes...great buy not to be disapointed <end>  Very Beautiful  This is a very beautiful piece of jewelry. I am surprised at the price because it is so well made and solid, I don't think anyone will ever know that the sparkly stones are CZ's. <end>  I Absolutely Love It!  This necklace is simply beautiful! Not only do I love the "key to my heart" concept, but the quality, too, is very nice. It's definitely shiny / sparkly, but it's not too overwhelming, and the dainty size is perfect for dressy or casual wear. The customer submitted image really doesn't do the necklace justice. I'm very pleased with this purchase. I wear it everyday! <end>  great gift  purchased as a gift and my daughter and she loves it. The chain was tangled upon receiving it but was able to get it untangled <end>  very disappointed  The charm itself was acceptable, however, due to the lack of care involved when packaging this item, the chain arrived to me knots and broken beyond repair. The chain arrives coiled up in a little pouch. For such a fragile chain, this is definitely a necklace that needs to be secured in a box, not coiled up in a small pouch where it will likely get in knots. The chain was broken and useless, i had to return it, and just purchase a new chain locally, as this was suppose to be a Christmas gift. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful!  I just received my sterling silver cz heart/key necklace today, 12/19/12. In a word...BEAUTIFUL! It's small, but not too small. Im an adult...a thick girl, and it doesnt get lost on my neck. Nice sparkle. I love it. Oh, I received it within days after ordering it. <end>  M13  I love this necklace. The charm is absolutely beautiful. The necklace is a little thin for me and I will replace it for another one a little thicker. Overall it's worth buying especially for the price. It's great. I wear it every day, and love it. <end>  Very cheap  Bought this knecklace, but it was very cheap looking. One of the "diamonds" fell out of the heart already and has started to turn colors. Only a month old. <end>
 B000J4GFCY  Silver *DUCKY CHARM* Duckling Duck Cute ||	  misleading  this is misleading because i thought i was getting the necklass with it so i wasnt happy  ( they should not have the actuall necklass in the pic of the product they were trying to sell . <end>  Just Ducky  I got this at a gift for a lady who keeps her "ducks in a row." It's very cute, looks exactly as shown. <end>  BEST CHARM EVER!!!  wow....this is such an adorable charm. i got this for a gift and it is just such great quality and it even comes in its own little baggy...its a great unforgettable gift!!! <end>
 B000J4GFJC  Cancer Awareness 925 Silver * RIBBON CHARM * Show SUPPORT ||	  Very cute, just what I wanted  I am very happy with this purchase. I wear it every day and have no complaints. I bought a black satin chain also on Amazon to wear it on. <end>  Charms  Perfect size for my medical alert bracelet. I am a small person and am always looking for small charms and this find was great. <end>
 B000J4GLOQ  Jewelry Care Cleaning For Sterling Silver, Gold, and Most Other Metals ||	  Adequate  The cleaning cloth was much smaller than I was anticipating - when comparing to those sold by other companies. It does, however, do a good job cleaning silver so it does what it is supposed to do. <end>  ok product  Cleans gold and silver well. The only complain - it also "cleans off" comletely 18K gold overlay, although it suppose to be safe to use on gold 14K & 18K <end>  Good  It is 2 cloths sewn together like a book. One cloth is approx 4 x 6, the other is about 1/2 inch smaller. it was centered onto the larger cloth then folded in half and sewn down the middle, so it is like 4 small cloths. You can polish both sides of your jewelry at same time without leaving finger prints. It also comes with care instructions. <end>
 B000J4GLXW  Sterling Silver CZ Moon Crescent Pendant ||	  Silver CZ moon pendant  The pendant was what i was looking for. It's nice...turns a bit when wearing it...but overall, Im pleased with my purchase. <end>
 B000J4GM36  Sterling Silver CZ Filigree Cross Locket Necklace, 18" ||	  Didn't close  This locket looked very nice for the price. That is why it got 2 stars, but it didn't close and didn't appear to have any mechanism for closing. It was useless and unwearable so I returned it. <end>  Sterling silver CZ filigree cross locket necklace  I recently purchased three of these lockets (one for myself and the other two for members of my family) and am extremely pleased with the quality and price! They were shipped promptly and I had absolutely no problem with the condition in which they were received, contrary to what some of the other reviews have stated. I was happy to find a locket that also had a cross, as the religious significance was an important aspect in this purchase. This is a beautiful piece of jewelry at an exceptional value! <end>  Good for the Price  For the price, this was a very good item. The picture you would use does have to be rather small and the chain quality could be better, but overall not a bad purchase. It does look very lovely in person and the hinges on the lock didn't seem very flimsy, which is something I was worried about. I would recommend! <end>  Worth the price!  Definitely worth the price! Mine strangely came a little bent, and it didn't sit straight on my chest. I had to take out my father's tools and straighten the top link part. It hangs straight now, and it's very pretty. I use it as a scent locket. <end>  A little delicate peace for an elegant and sensible woman  It is a very wonderful locket that you could use with as charm with a bracelet or as a loket and put photos inside too. I recommend this seller because they have many items with a low price, the work is sensacional looks a real jewerly.L&eacute;ia A. PavlovskySo Paulo - BrazilSilver Filigree Marcasite Genuine Amethyst Cross Locket <end>  Good - wife loved it  Locket was a little hard to open at first  but my nails suck. Wife has no problem with it. She loves having a locket with a picture of her baby and cat in it. prodcut came quickly too. <end>  Excellent  She loved it! Wasn't sure if it comes with a neckless, but it does. Very neat locket. <end>  Sterling Silver Simulated Diamond CZ Filigree Cross Locket  I wear this all the time - love it. Great product for the money. <end>
 B000J4GM72  Sterling Silver Cabochon Genuine Onyx Stone Bali Pendant ||	  So - So.........  This pendant was cute, but much smaller than the picture portrayed it. The quality was good, but not what I was looking for. Would not have bought it if I knew how small it really was. <end>
 B000J4GOM0  Sterling Silver White and Red Stone Lady Cameo Pendant ||	  Do Not Buy  Sterling Silver White and Red Stone Lady Cameo PendantBate and switch should be the name of this cameo. The one in the picture is beautiful the one I recieved is not. The lady is very poorly carved. If they had shown the one on line that I recieved I never would have ordered it. <end>  I never received anything  Frankly, I'm angry. I never received the item ever. The company won't return my emails or calls. The only time they responded they told me it was already delivered, which it clearly was not.DO. NOT. BUY from this vendor. <end>
 B000J4GOZW  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz Stone Filigree Oval Pendant ||	  Best for a child or teen  It's way smaller than the picture suggests. It's too girly-looking for a senior although if it was larger, I might have worn it. It seems to be more fit for a teenager. It's a very pretty blue and the pendant is nicely crafted but the chain is too flimsy and short. <end>
 B000J4GRG8  Sterling Silver 6mm Genuine Lapis Stone Bead Beaded Dangle Hook Earrings Stretch Bracelet Necklace 15-19" Jewelry Set ||	  Lapis stone earring/necklace/bracelet set  This is another replacement for items lost in our Feb 2012 housefire. I have utilized this company for other colors--very good craftmanship and I feel confident wearing them at work in a busy Day Surgery Department; I do not feel they will break and fall on my patients. Well wrapped and arrived early. Thank you to the vendor and Amazon. <end>
 B000J4GRPE  Sterling Silver Multi Color Cats Eye Pink Blue Beaded Bracelet Set ||	  Pretty but not well made  These bracelets are pretty but not very well made. The wire was sticking out at the ends which scratched my wrist. I re-strung the beads, which solved the problem. It was a lot of hassle for a couple of bracelets. <end>
 B000J4GVIC  Sterling Silver Bracelet with Simulated Amethyst (CZ) ||	  Amethyst Sparkler  The stones in this bracelet are much lighter than in the picture. I would describe them as pale amethyst. The faceting, which I believe is called checkerboard, really catches the light. 7 1/4" in length, 5mm wide. <end>
 B000J4GVRS  Sterling Silver Cuff Bangle Turquoise Flower Bracelet ||	  thank you  thank you for your excellant service. i am giving this bracelet for a birthday present. she will like it very much. happy trails <end>  sterling silver cuff bangle turquiose flower bracelet  Awesome item!

 B000J4GVSC  Sterling Silver Denim Lapis, Mother of Pearl, and Turquoise Cuff Bracelet ||	  lovely bracelet  Got this bracelet two or three years ago and I'm still wearing it! It is exceptionally well priced, durable, quality appearance, and the size is fine for me- average to tall height female. I am so attached to this and it is so versatile, that I almost bought a second one when I thought I had lost this last week. Fortunately, I found it adorning my 2 yr. old grandaughter! <end>  very small - for a child  more for a child/ teenager/young girl than adult- i returned it for that reason. the return service was very effective. <end>
 B000J4GW1I  Sterling Silver Red Coral Beaded Bracelet ||	  Sterling Silver Red Coral Beaded Bracelet, necklace & earrings  My daughter-in-law had asked me about red coral jewelry, necklace in particular, was on Amazon, clicked jewelry just to check, and wala, here were the bracelet, necklace and earrings - purchased one of each of them, received them, looked great, told my son, so he wanted them for Mother's Day gifts for him, his daughter, and son, and MOM loves them!!!! It was perfect - 3 pieces made a gift from each of them!! Thanks Amazon!! <end>
 B000J4GWI6  Sterling Silver Red Sqaure and Simulated CZ Circle Bracelet ||	  DISPLEASED  i WILL NEVER ORDER ANOTHER PIECE OF JEWELRY FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN. I NEVER REICEIVED MY BRACELET AND IT WAS FOR AN IMPORTANT DAY. I DID NOT GET MY MONEY REFUNDED AND I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER BACK ON HOW I CAN GET IT REFUNDED. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND I'M STILL UPSET. <end>  It's a Keeper!  The colored stones are a very dark pink red as opposed to a blue or orange red. Just as sparkly and pretty as the pink,Sterling Silver Square and Circle Pink CZ and Simulated Diamond CZ Tennis Bracelet, and the black,Sterling Silver Black Sqaure and Simulated Diamond CZ Circle Bracelet. 7 1/4" in length. 1/4" wide. I've communicated with this company by phone and e-mail and have had no problems with returns and exchanges. <end>
 B000J4GWNG  Sterling Silver Elephant Bracelet ||	  Sterling silver elephant bracelet  This bracelet was for my granddaughter who loves elephants and it is a very nice bracelet and of quality.

I shipped it to my cousin who is a Delta and she love this bracelet. <end>  Very Pleased  Bought this for my girlfriend. She loves it, says it's "very cute". Better than I was even expecting and very good price. <end>
 B000J4GWS6  Genuine Denim Lapis Chip Stretch Bracelet ||	  T  These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit. Since they were so inexpensive, I was able to give everyone a gift. <end>  Chips of Fun  This denim lapis chip stretch bracelet and matching earrings are a fun way to liven up a casual outfit. I love wearing them with my jeans! <end>  Subjective Disappointment  The bracelet was a great price. It arrived promptly. It looks pretty much as represented in the picture (much more gray, though). I shoud be pleased --- but I'm not. The problem is I also bought the earrings and they are much more royal blue than the bracelet, with virtually no gray. The bracelet just looks lifeless and dull in comparison. But it is only in comparison to the earrings -- an objective review would have resulted in 5 stars  I started with 3, then adjusted to 4 in an attempt to be fair.I think if you are looking for a well-matched set you should order more than one bracelet and choose the one that best matches the earrings (or vice versa). <end>  Quality at a Good Price  This bracelet is very nice. I love precious stones. Here I have the quality stones at a very good price. I agree with what another purchaser said; this item will make a great stocking stuffer. <end>  Pretty bracelet with a comfy fit!  This was a gift for my step daughter. She never takes it off and says it is comfy to wear. The stones are pretty! Good gift! Thanks! <end>  christmas gift  My co-worker loved this gift and matching earring that came with the gift. It was reasonable and helped me to stay on budget. <end>  Attractive  Great value for Lapis chips. Stones are nice colored and look nice.Delicate with small chips. Inexpensive little gift for someone or yourself. <end>  Great for the price  I have ordered several stretch bracelets from this company and I like everyone of them. You can not beat the price. I love to stack them, mixing with different gemstones and sterling silver. I live on the beach in FL, so these are perfect for me. And they ship them quickly. Great Buy! <end>  cute. The chips are a not that big, good for a casual day.  The chips are a not that big, good for a casual day.i wish the bracelet was with a clasp instead of a stretch. <end>
 B000J4GX8K  Genuine Lapis Stone 6mm Bead Silver Heart Charm Bracelet ||	  Beautiful Bracelet  This bracelet is really beautiful. It looks much more expensive than it was. Silverspeck has lovely jewelry at a wonderful price. <end>  Beautiful  It feels very light and looks very pretty but is a little overpriced to be honest. It could be a little bit cheaper than for its sold on amazon but I would still buy it again because it feels very light and looks great. <end>
 B000J4GX9Y  Genuine Amethyst Stone 4mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Pretty and appropriate size beads  I use these inexpensive stretch bracelets for their healing properties. I absolutely love the 4 mm size beads because they look like they are for adults and not for a little girls wrist. The larger beads seem to look so cheap to me. I recommend these 4 mm varieties of semi-precious stones - quite a good deal too. <end>  Cute Bracelet  This bracelet is really cute and just perfect for summer. The beads arevery uniform and have a beautiful purple color - unlike some amethystbeads that are pale and washed out.I wear this bracelet with several gold bangles and it adds just the rightamount of color to make the look POP. I'm a happy girl!  ) <end>  Great bracelet  Great color in the amethyst and the bracelet was actually a comfortable size whereas I often have problems with the too-small ones. <end>
 B000J4GXAI  Genuine Lapis Stone 4mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Did not receive  Though I paid for it, it never arrived with my other stretch bracelets. I contacted the seller, SilverSpeck, and advised them of this omission. A week has gone by and it is still MIA.Will not order from this company again. <end>  Pretty & Not Cheap Looking  Surprizingly pretty. Does not like cheap and I love the 4mm size beads. I would recomment this bracelet. Can;t beat the price. <end>
 B000J4GXD0  Genuine Amethyst Stone 6mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Purple Bracelet  This is a nice bracelet. The beads are shiny and uniform in size. The color is much darker than the online picture. In fact, the color of this bracelet matches the 8mm bracelet by SilverSpeck,Genuine Amethyst Stone 8mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet. Inside unstretched measurement is six inches. <end>  amethyst beaded bracelet  The bracelet matches the amethyst beaded necklace & I love it. Great buy for the money. <end>
 B000J4H19A  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Created Multi Opal & Diamond Accent Rectangle Link Bracelet ||	  be careful  The product name is misleading....it says 24K gold it is NOT SOLID it is PLATED!!!! But I have no complaints about the company. They were quick to send it out in the first place and I had NO problems what so ever in sending it back and getting a refund. They stand by their products and YOUR satisfaction. I'd buy from them again but this time I KNOW the jewelry is silver plated. Just a little disappointed the item description wasn't a more up front about it. <end>  Boke within a week.  Very pretty but don't get used to it.It broke in 2 places and I take very good care of and am careful withmy jewelry. Very disappointed. <end>  I would buy it again.  This is a very pretty, delicate yet colorful bracelet. When reviewing, I always ask my self if I would buy an item again  Yes I would.I receive many compliments on it. The fastener is actually easier to operate ring types. <end>
 B000J4H1EA  18k Gold over Sterling Silver CZ Channel-Set Tennis Bracelet ||	  Excellent bracelet!  I got this for my girlfriend, for Christmas, and she has worn it every single day since then. She absolutely loves it! It has not faded or degraded in quality in any way after consistent use for 4 months. I highly recommend this! <end>  Love it!!!  I love this bracelet so much I am buying another one. The gold does wear off if you wear it everyday which I do but it still looks nice. <end>  Good buy  Beautiful bracelet and has not changed in color or oxidized during the times that I have worn it. Would definitely buy again from this seller. <end>
 B000J4H2TY  Sterling Silver 6mm Simulated Red Coral Stone Bead Beaded Chain 15-19" Necklace ||	  Very Pretty  The necklace is beautiful, tasteful, and very elegant. The stones are on the petite side and that is exactly what I wanted with a red colored jewel...the price is excellent! <end>  not describe well  I received this necklace and it was barely long enough for a 3 yr old child. I could not even get it around my neck. I will use the beads for something else. disappointed <end>
 B000J4H30M  Genuine Honey Brown Amber Silver Chip Necklace ||	  amber chip necklace  Nice little piece just as described and great for the price! I use it to hang a larger pendant off it and it makes for an unusual combination that I get many compliments on. It was very shipped quickly. <end>
 B000J4H30W  7-8mm Round Hand Knotted Genuine Freshwater Cultured White Pearl 14k Gold Filigree Clasp Necklace 18" ||	  Great product!  I ordered 4 of these necklaces. They are all very nice, although the color of the pearls differs SLIGHTLY between the necklaces. (The individual necklaces have very slight if any differentiation in color of the pearls).This is a great item, and I am actually ordering one more for myself! <end>  Great Price!!  Although not quite round pearls, they are a great price, color, luster, quality and size. I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it if you are looking for a great deal. <end>
 B000J4H6FY  Sterling Silver Pink & Clear CZ Hoop Earrings ||	  Beautiful Earrings  I bought these earrings for my 2 year old daughter. She kept pulling out regular earrings because they were too tight on her ears and bothered her. I started looking for a pair of hoops with a latch back that would be comfortable. I found a pair at a store for $65, which I think is too much to pay for a pair of earrings that could need to be replaced if an earrings gets lost. These are perfect with a perfect price. My daughter loves wearing "earrings like mommy" These do not bother her and I have had no more problems with her taking them off. <end>  nice  Nice earrings, I purchased these for my niece. However they irritated hear ears, i think its because of the weight and she's only had her piercing for a year. She can wear them for a day only. They are very nice though! <end>
 B000J4H6GI  Sterling Silver Pink Coral Bead LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Simple, pretty earrings  Loved the colour. The colour turned out to be a prettier pink colour than shown. The proportions of the earrings were also much better than expected.On the whole a great buy at a great price. <end>
 B000J4H6RW  Celebrity Inspired Silver Simulated CZ Round Bezel Set Leverback Lever Back Earrings ||	  very poorly made  i got the earrings in the mail today. The stones are not put in nicely. it looks poorly made, nothing at all like the photo. Where the stones hang, it was bend and when I tried to bend it in place, it broke off. So now, I have to go to a jeweler and get a new earpiece. They're definetely not worth the price. <end>
 B000J4H7S0  Sterling Silver 20mm Polished Hoop Earrings ||	  Smaller  Product was nice, just thought it was smaller. I was getting them for my 4 yr old daughter and when received realized that they were too big for her little ears - so I got them! <end>
 B000J4H80C  Sterling Silver Red Cubic Zirconia Square Stud Earrings 6 mm ||	  The best Bang for your Dollar.  I bought these match a ring I gave my girlfriend. They look great and she loves them. She wears the ring and ear rings all the time now. She told me the backs are a little long and the clasp has fallen off one time. So she is thinking about getting a different clasp for them. They seem to be holding up great because she has worn them for over a month straight now. <end>  red earrings  I love this earrings. I was looking for some red jewelry to go with my gameday outfits (go UGA!) and these are great. The color is actually a deeper red than the picture, but they're pretty big and shiny. I love them. <end>
 B000J4H8AW  Ruby Red Cubic Zirconia Triangle Studs Silver Earrings ||	  Impressive!  These ruby CZ studs look rich. They are of high quality. The recipient talked about how hard it is to find red earrings - period. She was pleased with the beauty and quality of her gift. <end>
 B000J4H8BG  Sterling Silver Cobra Snake Earrings ||	  Disappointed  In person, the earrings look kind of like sperm, and they don't hang nicely. They twist, so the faces are in back. Also, they are on the heavier side and are uncomfortable for people with sensitive ears. I'm thinking of reworking them into a necklace or something. <end>
 B000J4HA00  Sterling Silver Pink , Dark Blue, Green, Red, Green, and Light Blue Crystal Flower Earrings ||	  Sterling Silver Pink , Dark Blue, Green, Red, Green, and Light Blue Crystal Flower Earrings  I'm not sure if it's silver <end>
 B000J4HCL2  Sterling Silver 6mm Simulated Orange Cats Eye Stone Bead Beaded Dangle Hook Earrings ||	  Not orange  These earrings are very pretty, but they are NOT orange as described. They are yellow. I was very disappointed when I got them because I had gotten them as a surprise for my daughter who wanted orange earrings, and these are definitely yellow not orange! <end>
 B000J4HD66  Sterling Silver Small Jewish Star of David Mini Kid Stud Dangle Earrings ||	  Excelent!!!  Thank you very much for your product. It is a good material. My doughter is very happy with the earrings.Excelent !!! <end>
 B000J4HD84  Sterling Silver 6mm Genuine Onyx Stone Bead Beaded Dangle Hook Earrings ||	  Simple yet nice  The earrings are very simple and small but at the same time elegant and nice. The black onyx stone is matte in color but still compliments the silver hook and bottom bead elegantly. <end>
 B000J4HDHK  Simulated Honey Brown Amber Silver Chip Dangle Earrings ||	  great for Fall wardrobes  I would have given these a five star rating, but I still think that they are smaller than I expected them to be, which is my pet pieve with all the "chip" earrings in general. However, having said all that, I must say that the colors are very close to the picture. If you wear smaller, less than an inch-size earrings, I think you will be happy with these. <end>
 B000J4HDPW  Sterling Silver & Gold Overlay Two Tone Puffed Heart Earrings ||	  EARRINGS  Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) and Silver Two Tone Heart EarringsLOOK REALLY NICE WITH TWO OF MY NECKLACES <end>
 B000J4HDR0  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Genuine Green Jade Oval Leverback Earrings ||	  Great Gift!  I bought this as a last minute gift for my grandmother because she loves jade. It was shipped to my dad's house very quickly and they looked very good. My grandmother loved them which is really all that matters because she is so hard to shop for! Great pick if you get these. <end>  broken  I recived these earrings and one was broken, they looked lovely but was broken and had to return. <end>  bad earrings  These earrings were a scam.l sent them right back. The jade stones were about a quarter of an inch and the clasps did not work. Don't get taken in by their add. <end>  Jade earrings  I thought the earrings were pretty on the order page. But, when I recieved them I thought the pictute did not do them justice. They are really a beautiful pair of earrings and I have had a lot of complements when wearing them. <end>
 B000J4HDVG  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Antique Filigree Chandelier Earrings ||	  Nice weight and NOT dainty!  These are definetly NOT dainty! YAY! They arent BIG but they surely arent small. Id say a Medium size. The weight is just right.not so light you dont know they are there, not so heavy your ear hurts...PERFECT weight. You know theyre on, but they are not at all bothersome. Very noticeable, very pretty. And they arent flimsy either like alot of other filigree jewelry! Very beautiful. I love em! They are fit for a Maharani Princess! <end>  Beautiful earrings  Loved these earrings so much bought two pair. Bedautiful detail size a bit big but I like it. I would recommend them to anyone. And a great deal. <end>
 B000J4HGFY  14k Gold Gold Polished Reversible 4mm Ball Earrings ||	  Sorry I purchased these earrings  I purchased these earrings for my two granddaughters (9 and 7) for Christmas. Thinking that the srew backs would make changing clothes much easier and all children earrings come with screw backs these would be perfect. They didn't have them in but a few days and the backs started coming off in their sleep, at first their mother could find the backs in bed in the morning but shortly after re-screwing the backs on almost daily one has come up missing. I have tried calling the store, emailing and going through Amazon to get to talk with these people and no one will respond. It was a big waste of money on two pair. Buyer beware! <end>
 B000J4HWB2  Sardelli - 14k White Gold 4mm Bezel Set Cubic Zirconia Post Earrings ||	  goof quality posts, fake looking stones  The 14k gold posts seemed to be good quality, comfortable for me to wear for weeks without causing any skin reaction on my super sensitive earlobes. The stones are lacking the sparkles, looks more like acrylic beads compared to the Amazon collection CZ stud earrings I've purchased. <end>
 B000J4IBW6  Silver * DIVER CHARM * Scuba Sea Sport ||	  Cutest Charm  Bought this for my stepdaughter who is into scuba diving "big time"!! She just loves it!! <end>
 B000J4IC34  Murano Round Glass Millefiori Pendant ||	  Glass Pendant (small!)  This is a nice necklace for the price, but it is much smaller than I was expecting (&lt;1 inch). The chain is fairly cheap, but you get what you pay for. <end>
 B000J4IHVG  Sterling Silver bali pendant with Genuine Peridot stone ||	  peridot pendant  A very pretty piece, many compliments. The chain is very delicate, so I will be making a change, but otherwise I love this necklace. <end>  Sparkly just begins to describe this one!  I had read other reviews on Silverspeck products but was amazed when this one arrived at my home. The peridot is very sparkly and the silver is pristine. The chain is small but is the right size for the piece. I feel that these items are the right size for the price, however I have only had one bad experience, where what I ordered was not what I received. Be careful if you order something that says it's garnet and it arrives as amathyst. If you don't think the picture looks right..you are probably right. I ordered a garnet necklace and received an amathyst. Good thing I like amathyst. <end>  Peridot pendant  I love the pendant. I did put it on a different necklace. The chain that it came with gave me a rash ;(. I have gotten so many compliments on the pendant. <end>  beautiful  I bought two of them. One for me and one for my friend. They are beautiful and elegant.Recommand it to you all. <end>  Too Small  Very pretty & sparkly pendant but too small. The chain is extremely thin and would easily break. I gave it away. <end>
 B000J4IK8Q  Sterling Silver White Cubic Zirconia and Pink Cubic Zirconia Pave Flower Pendant ||	  CUTE!!!!  It looks even cuter in person! I thought it was going to be bigger actually but it's pretty small (about from the tip of my index finger to my 1st knuckle). I think that makes it look even better though. It's very sparkly and will go great with my prom dress ^^It took about 5 days to get from NY to FL though but I didn't need it immediately so it's fine I was just impatient because I wanted it really bad T_T <end>  Just Like the Real Thing  This pendant ROCKS! It sparkles with as much brilliance as real gem stones. It is a perfect size for my 10 year old daughter whom I plan to give it to at Christmas. Also, because it is reasonably priced, there is not so much worry in regard to her breaking or losing it. The seller, Silver Speck always delivers in a timely fashion and in attractive packaging. <end>
 B000J4IKQI  Genuine Tiger Eye Stone Twisted Sterling Silver Border Oval Pendant ||	  Good value for the money  The chain is a little flimsy, but the tiger eye pendant itself has good color, and is a nice size--my wife liked it, and that's good enough for me. <end>
 B000J4IKZY  Sterling Silver Etched Flower Design Heart 4-Way Locket Necklace, 18" ||	  Nice Pendant. Worthless Chain.  Pros  I have seen nicer sterling silver pieces before, but overall, this is a nice pendant for the price. I especially love the fact that it has 4 spots for photos. It's also a nice size - not too huge that it looks awkward, and not so small that you can't even see the pictures you put in it.Cons  They might as well have not even included a chain because it's a piece of junk. I docked it 1 star because of this and almost docked it 2 stars, but I figured most people would buy this item assuming they had to replace the chain anyways. But, be sure to consider that additional expense when weighing the cost of this item. Would have been nice if the locket was more like $25 considering you'll spend another $10 bucks to get a decent chain. <end>  Beautiful Locket!  This locket is beautiful! Very cool on how it opens up! Not sure how Im going to put pictures in there, but will figure it out! Definitely worth buying! However it is a little heavy for the chain so I bought one that works better. <end>  cheap but shic!  Very pretty locket. Lots of complements so far. I love it! the embellisments are beautiful. <end>  Nice Locket  Not to pricy!!! And a sweet deal for someone you care about. Mom a friend. <end>  Exactly what I asked for!  I bought this as a gift and it arrived in a timely fashion. It was exactly what I was looking for and I can't wait to give it to that person! <end>  Nice quality  I gave this to my granddaughter for her birthday and she really liked it. It is real pretty but the chain is really thin. <end>  Wish I actually got a necklace!  I ordered this for my three year old so for her first day of preschool she could have a necklace with a picture of her mommy, daddy, baby brother and doggy inside. Instead I got a ridiculously cheap pair of earrings - I'm pretty sure they're plastic! I was so dissappointed and had to scramble to find another locket for my daughter. And now I have to deal with the whole process of returning the earrings and getting a refund. Nightmare!! <end>
 B000J4INBA  Sterling Silver Stylish Interchangeable 7 Round Cats Eye Stone Filigree Ring Set Size 7 ||	  good ring  gems are a good size, they don't come out easy. Putting them in requires some force, but this is a good thing. Good value. <end>  Great ring - great price  I love this ring and the quality of the ring. Also, the stones (marbles) are beautiful. The price is really amazing because my friend bought a similar ring from an art fair and paid almost 90.00! I love it! <end>
 B000J4INCY  Murano Glass Millefiori Flower Sterling Silver Earrings Set ||	  Fantastic  The product was very nice it was what I expect and more I would definitely buy from this vendor in the future <end>  Good value for the money  These were a great find. The colors I got were exactly as pictured and are varied enough to match any outfit. The quality is good. I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with these so they must be real sterling silver. They are light, comfortable, small enough to look professional and dangle enough to catch the eye. In short -perfect. They came on time and I would definitely buy again from this seller. <end>
 B000J4IQMQ  Sterling Silver Polished San Marco Bracelet - 7 Inch ||	  More Than I Expected  I wasn't expecting much for $20, but I was pleasantly surprised. Highly polished, sturdy construction. Weighty looking without being heavy. FYI  Because of the nature of Marco bracelets, when it's clasped it still has some give in it, but it takes on characteristics of a bangle, but that doesn't detract from it's beauty. Highly polished. 7 1/4" length, 5/16" width. <end>  Buyer Be Ware!  I purchased five of these bracelets to give as gifts. I wondered how the bracelet that was pictured could be sold so inexpensively. Now I know - the bracelets that I received are nothing like the bracelet this company represents in its pictures. The photos show an actual San Marco bracelet with fully formed, individual links. What I received should be called an "Illusion San Marco bracelet". There are tiny "links" that are actually only about 1/3 of a true San Marco link - just the side of a link. Think of cutting a length-wise piece off an elbow macaroni so that the piece is rounded on the outside and hollowed out on the inside, and you'll get the idea. Plus, they packaged the bracelets in such short, narrow little plastic bags that each of the bracelets has an odd bend or kink in it. Of course these are going back, and they have left an extremely poor impression. <end>
 B000J4IR6G  Sterling Silver Turquoise Shapes Bangle Bracelet ||	  small item  I am satisfied with this product in all aspects, except for the size of the bracelet. I will let the person who receives this gift be the judge on the size. <end>
 B000J4ISFQ  Genuine Amethyst, Aventurine, Rose Quartz, and Crystal Chip Bracelet ||	  fast shipping; great product!  Beautiful braclets, and you can't deny the energy of the stone combination. I bought 6 of them to give as gifts for Christmas..and of course one for myself  ) LOVE it! <end>  So cute  This is a great little bracelet... natural and nice looking. I think it's very comfortable. <end>  Very pretty  I bought this to match an outfit and it looks great. For me the bracelet was itchy but I don't think this would be the case for everyone. For the price it looks great. I am enjoying wearing it and have received several compliments on it. <end>  Dainty and cute  The reason I bought this bracelet was because of what each gem represented. You may or may not believe in the seemingly hokey beliefs of gemstones BUT I do. I don't treat this bracelet as a good luck charm but as an affirmation to myself, to keep my mind focused on what is important, and to focus on the big picture.So far this bracelet is doing its job by looking cute and reminding me to keep calm. I recall another reviewer saying this bracelet is made for those with slender wrists and I agree. I do like this bracelet and I think it would make a wonderful gift to a friend who may or may not need a reassuring affirmation in her life. <end>  Small and delicate, nice design!  I purchased this gemstone bracelet months ago, as I have saved it as a gift. It is small, most suited for a younger girl, I think... but the design is lovely, the colors very nice. I would wear it with something simple, to set off the color of something I wear, but for now, I want to send it to my friend, who is much younger than I.  ) <end>
 B000J4ISOC  Sterling Silver Venetian Murano Glass Beaded Millefiori Flower Stretch Bracelet ||	  Beautiful glass beads--smaller fit  I confess to purchasing this lovely bracelet for the reason most others don't  the diameter is smaller than many stretch bracelets. Internal circumference=6.25"; internal diameter=2". This may be small for a medium or larger wrist, but it is very difficult to find stretch bracelets that fit a smaller wrist. (A stretch bracelet shouldn't fit like a bangle.)The bracelet I received is exactly as depicted  14 colorful Murano-style glass beads with silver-colored plastic bead spacers. The beads are definitely glass; however, they appear to be machine-made rather than genuine Venetian Murano millefiori beads, and lack the precise design of hand-made Murano beads.Still, the bracelet is a colorful, festive addition to my bracelet collection, and one that I find wearing almost every day for its versatile colors. For the price, I would definitely recommend! <end>  Pretty Bracelet  This bracelet is very pretty. However, the beads do not look or feel like Murano glass; I am sure that they are plastic. Also, the bracelet is not very stretchy. My wrists and hands are small, so I didn't have trouble getting in on and off, but someone with a larger build might. <end>  Disappointing  The image shows 14 glass beads however the bracelet I received had only 13.If you have a medium + size wrist this bracelet will be a tight fit.Disappointed I was 'short changed'! <end>  Beautiful!  Bought this for my mom - she loves it! I also bought the pendant and the watch... the set looks great together! <end>  beaded stretch bracelet  This is very beautiful and fits my small wrist nicely. The colors are very beautiful & vibrant. Would recommend to anyone. <end>  MURANO GLASS STRETCH BRACELET  I JUST LOVE STRETCH BRACELETS, THEY ARE SO EASY.I LIKE THE COLORS, BUT IT'S A LITTLE TIGHT, NOT A LOSEPIECE. <end>  Lovely bracelet!  I just received three of these bracelets and they are lovely. I have all 14 beads the size is perfect for my wrist and the beads are glass! When I compare the bracelets to a Millefiori necklace I bought in Venice you can't tell them apart, except the beads are a little larger on the bracelet, otherwise a perfect match! Great costume jewelry! <end>  Small in size and beads  Good thing I have small wrists, because it is small and the glass beads are also very small. This would be good for a pre-teen girl, but not for an adult. Not happy with my purchase. <end>  So Pretty  This bracelet is so pretty. I love wearing it. It also comes with a very nice pouch for storing it. <end>  Bracelet a hit with the giftee  Bought as a gift. Person to whom I gifted it was extremely satisfied. LOVED it. Quality is excellent and a great buy for the price. I am considering one for myself. <end>
 B000J4ISQA  Genuine Hematite, Onyx, Carnelian, and Sterling Silver Beaded Bracelet ||	  Lovely bracelet  I love the colors of the gem stones. This bracelet is really pretty and even nicer than the picture. I love wearing it! <end>
 B000J4ISXI  Simulated Light Orange Cats Eye Stone 6mm Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  Orange Cats  I had an excellent experience with this seller. My merchandise came earlier than scheduled and in brand new condition. I would definitely do business with this seller again. <end>
 B000J4ISYW  Genuine Tiger Eye, Aventurine, Amethyst, Rose Quartz, Smokey Quartz, and Carnelian Stone Silver Bali Bead Beaded Stretch Bracelet ||	  colors make it very wearable  This is a pretty little bracelet with lots of colors so it goes with lots of different clothes. <end>  Pretty and Lucky Gem Stones  This bracelet is very pretty. Looks like the picture. I looked up what the meanings of the stones mean. They are very lucky stones. Amethyst  Power, Protection, and Healing. Rose Quartz  Love. Genuine Tiger Eye  Luck, Protection, and Healing. Aventurine  Luck, Money, and Healing. Smokey Quartz  Power, Money, and Healing. Carnelian  Power and Healing. It is held together by a stretchy string. I hope it doesn't break. It is very pretty. <end>  Beautiful  I absolutely loved this bracelet. Unfortunately, while at the Celtic Festival in Belfast, I lost it. It was exquiste and just what I wanted. Not to worry, however, as with Amazon I can certaily order it again!Thank you so much for such a beautiful piece at such an affordable price. <end>
 B000J4IWFW  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Created Pink Opal & Diamond Accent Rectangle Link Bracelet ||	  very pretty bracelet  This bracelet was a Christmas gift for my son's girlfriend. She loves everything pink. The bracelet is delicate, but very well made. It is a solid, pretty bracelet with a good clasp to prevent loss. I was very satisfied with the bracelet. The gift was received with delight! <end>
 B000J4IWUW  Designer Vermeil (24kt Gold over Silver) Tri Color Designer Heart Bracelet ||	  perfect  This is a Christmas present and I know my sister will love it! VERY pretty and great price! <end>
 B000J4IWWK  Two Toned Floating Bezel Set Simulated Diamond CZ Bracelet. ||	  Silver Speck  The bracelet is beautiful and for the money it is top quality. I am 100% satisfied and would definitely order from Silver Speck again. Great quality at reasonable price. What more could you ask for? <end>
 B000J4IX8I  Sterling Silver Beaded Turquoise Necklace ||	  Much smaller than the picture suggests  The picture gives the impression that these beads are much larger than they are---they are actually very tiny. That must be a doll-sized neck they are using in the picture. I would return them, but the company's policy is that they don't refund shipping costs ($5.95 even though it was sent by first class parcel post mail and is extremely light weight). Rather that be out nearly $6 for that, I'll keep this, and find some future use for it--stocking stuffer, maybe--but I certainly won't do business with this company again. If I could find a way to rate it with minus stars, I would. <end>  Exactly what I wanted!  I am very pleased with the workmanship, color of the turquoise, and the speed with which I received it. <end>
 B000J4J18E  Sterling Silver multicolor inlay earrings with Genuine onyx center ||	  They're as cute as they want to be, but...  These earrings are cute and they look pretty much as they are pictured. The only problem that I have with them, is that the wire part of the earrings--you know the part that drops into your lobe? One of the wires is about a quarter longer than the other one. Making one of the earrings somewhat longer than the other one.I don't know if this was some kind of manufacturing glitch or what? But it is very apparent to me.Because they are fairly casual looking, I won't really worry about returning them. I just wish that the people who are in charge of sending their products out, would inspect them to the point where something like this doesn't happen.In the end, it makes me nervous about ordering from this company in the future. <end>
 B000J4J1B6  Sterling Silver .925 Vintage Genuine Amber Stone Bali Bead LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Not as advertised  I am disappointed with this pair of earrings. The silver doesn't look real even though the 925 signature is present. The amber is also not very attractive as shown online. <end>
 B000J4J1IY  Sterling Silver Clear & Blue CZ Chandelier Earrings ||	  Very pretty, but dull stones  These are lovely earrings that look far more expensive than they are ... except for the "Blue CZ" stones. They look and feel just like plastic. It's a terrible detriment to the set. I may have to have them replaced by a jeweler (if I can) in order for them to be appropriate for my brother-in-law's wedding. However, they look good enough that I'm looking for a matching necklace. <end>
 B000J4J20Q  Simulated Simulated CZ and Simulated Tanzanite Blue CZ Row Omega Silver Earrings ||	  Gorgeous!  So, my really good friend is getting married - at a casino. My dress is classic vintage 50's - think Lauren Bacall - perfect. These earrings are the pefect compliment and everything I was looking for! They are stunning, and arrived safely in a little ziploc jewelry bag, inside a velvet jewelry bag - nice detail. I was a little nervous about buying earrings online, and am really excited that I'm not disappointed. Definitely will consider this vendor for future earring purchases. <end>
 B000J4J292  Sterling Silver Sapphire and Ruby with Diamond Accent Open Heart MOM Earrings ||	  Happy Birthday  I told a dear friend about how pretty I thought these earrings were in a conversation with no real intention, she then asked if it was a "hint" about my birthday? I jokingly said it hadn't started that way but it was now  ) then forgetting about the conversation i was very pleasantly surprised a few weeks later when I got these earrings they are very pretty and a good size they are not too big. I love them  ) <end>
 B000J4J29M  Silver Drop Amazonite Bead Dangling Earrings ||	  Amazonite  This is a beautiful shade of Amazonite and receives many compliments. The size of the bead makes them stand out without being overpowering. Another beautiful product from SilverSpeck. <end>
 B000J4J2II  Dangling Reconstituted Turquoise & Genuine Amber Stone Beaded Earrings ||	  I like these earrings very much !  Cute earrings, stay easily in the ear. Great quality and value. I would like to have others earrings like that ! I am satisfied ! <end>
 B000J4J332  Silver Yellow Smiley Face stud Earrings ||	  piece of junk  I purchased the smiley face earrings for my daughter and after wearing them one time I was disappointed to find out that the smiley face was a sticker that came off! I tried putting the sticker back on but in the process it ripped. I was going to return the earrings for a credit but decided by the time I pay shipping it wasn't worth it. I can't believe they think their sticker is actually going to stay on. <end>
 B000J4J34Q  Silver Vintage style Bali Flower Earrings ||	  TOTAL [...]!!!  Do not even waste your money on these cheap piece of crap earrings! They are total crap, and because the shipping cost was just as much as the earrings themselves, it isn't even worth it to ship them back for a refund! I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased these, but found out quickly that you get what you pay for! When I opened the small bubble mailer that they arrived in, the posts were bent, and I found that I could easily bend the earring themselves as well! They are very light weight and there is nothing to them. Buyer beware of these earrings - when it comes to jewelery, it just pays to spend the extra money! <end>
 B000J4J3IM  Sterling Silver Bali Beaded Genuine Amber Stone LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  wrong picture  I get that the description says "amber", and it is not usually red,so the earrings I received are of a light orange color, a bit dispointed, because I would have loved it to be more cherry amber.and also, the shape of the earrings is not as shown on the picture, it's more a simple oval shapenot bad, but not as expected <end>
 B000J4J3LY  Sterling Silver Lavender Tear Drop Cats Eye LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  beautiful an dperfect for every occassion  These earrings are one of the most versatile ones i have...I can wear them to a casual evening, a party or to work and they look equally appropriate.... they reflect the color of the dress/top a bit so they go well with a range of colors from white to pink to grey....and i have received many compliments for these too! <end>
 B000J4J3Y6  Sterling Silver Funky Triangle Earrings ||	  Beautiful Earrings!  These Sterling Silver Funky Triangle Earrings are beautiful! They were purchased for my teenage daughter. She loves them! <end>
 B000J4J468  Sterling Silver Orange cz Square Stud Earrings ||	  Orange!  I love the color on the earrings. I have been looking forever for a pair of orange earrings! It's a very-well made earring too. Don't buy your earrings from Claire's! My favorite pair so far.  ] <end>  LOVE  I LOVE these earrings! They look just like the photo. They are a perfect size and a really unique color, plus I like the box-shaped setting. Great purchase! <end>
 B000J4J4MC  Sterling Silver Infinity Design Earrings ||	  Unique and interesting  These are really unique sterling silver earrings. They are a longer length earring, which is what I was looking for. Very pleased. <end>
 B000J4J5MG  Sterling Silver Genuine Garnet Stone Teardrop LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Well made; beautiful stones  The heavier guage wire and leverbacks make these earrings feel very substantial and well made. The garnets have a very clear red tone (sometimes garnets are so black that you can't tell they're garnets). The wires are a bit long in the front, making the stone angle downward somewhat. <end>  Garnet Earrings  These are a wonderful gift for anyone with pierced ears. I bought these earrings for my 4-yr old and she loves them. They stay closed and do not catch on thinngs like some earrings. I would definetly by another pair for anyone. <end>  tiny and cheap  the only way the picture is accurate is to say that the earrings are lever backs with garnet tear drops.the setting was larger with the stones set poorly and significantly lower on the earring than pictured additionally the stones were significantly paler [almost brown in color] and smaller than the picture.i sent these back for a return which they provided but i had to cover both shipping and return shipping.dont bother, these are cheap. <end>  pretty but tiny  These are very pretty, and the quality of the stones seems good to my untrained eye. However, the picture is a little deceptive. The stones are tiny, and the earrings probably better suited for a child or preteen. <end>  not very well made  The color of the stones is really pretty but the earrings aren't very well made. The posts that hold the stone are different sizes on each earring, one sits down farther on the stone than the other. You can really notice it, but for the price I'm not going to replace them. I just hope my friend doesn't notice since they're a gift for her. <end>
 B000J4J7QA  Sterling Silver Filigree 34mm Hoop Earrings ||	  Love em!  I bought these because they were similar to a pair I bought in Mexico (and lost). They are simple and beautiful. Very lightweight so they don't pull on your ears. They are between the size of a quarter and a silver dollar. love them! <end>
 B000J4J814  Genuine Freshwater Cultured Peach Coin Pearl LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Horrible, unmatching leverbacks.  If I could give zero stars, I would. The leverback hooks for the earrings are different, very noticeably DIFFERENT. One is so much larger than the other, as to be very noticeable when worn. When I put them on, one earring hangs lower than the other. Even looking at them, the other hook is wider. It would be so much money to send them back that it isn't worth it, since they were 8.50 on sale. I will likely just throw them into the trash. I don't know how much a jeweler would charge me to get a leverbacks matching in size. The pearls actually match fine..., though.Not sure I will ever purchase from this seller again, unless it is an item that does not come as a pair.--an update  This seller sent another pair and they match this time, but they are NOT the dainty leverbacks you see in the picture. They are rather large, and bulky and not at all the way picutred here. Save your money. <end>
 B000J4J85U  18K Gold over Sterling Silver 4mm Round Created Fiery White Opal Stud Earrings ||	  Disappointing craftsmanship  Let me compliment these earrings first  the gems are quite beautiful - definitely fire opals despite being created stones. The gems have a rich depth of color and the gold complements the stones well. My problem with these earrings is that of workmanship. The first (and only) time I tried to wear these, one of the posts broke off. I pulled (gently) the back off the post to put them on and the post snapped off at the earring. I haven't been able to wear them at all. I wanted to return these but can't because I have misplaced the receipt. Other items on Amazon can be returned from the order online, but this isn't one of them. I've had good luck with SilverSpeck before but in this case I was disappointed. <end>  Nice Inexpensive Faux Opal Earrings  These earrings look exactly as shown in the picture. I have worn mine several times and they have shown no signs of tarnish. Hopefully they are actually 24k gold and will remain bright and shiny. The stones are a lovely iridescent blue/green/white color. So far I like them a lot and am glad I purchased them. Great price for these earrings! <end>  Lovely little earrings!  These little earrings are charming. They're obviously not mined opals, but they are pretty, "opal-y", and certainly a good value for the price. Altho I bought these for myself, they would be a nice first "good" set of earrings for a little girl. <end>  LOVE  I love these.. right price love opals.. Arrived on time or if not sooner... Have not lost them yet, bad habit of loosing ear rings.. <end>  WOW! What a deal  These little gems are fantastic. The gem stones had a lot of fire. They were shipped quickly. I ordered another pair of earrings from a different vendor at significantly more more money. These out shined the others by a long shot. My October-birthday sisters are pleased too. <end>  Perfect! Cute and believable!  I love opals and wanted some small and simple white opal yellow gold studs to match an opal pendant. These filled the bill perfectly! The gold overlay is very believable and it doesn't bother my ears at all. I love these for everday wear to the office or with a crisp white shirt and jeans. <end>
 B000J4J864  18K Gold over Sterling Silver CZ Teardrop Leverback Earrings ||	  I felt pretty  I was pleased when I received them, they were as pretty as I thought they would be, even better, and best of all, I felt pretty when I wore these. I wore them everyday til my scarf tore one off...lol, the ONE is still pretty!! I plan to get another pair, as I thought the price was reasonable <end>
 B000J4J86Y  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Celebrity Inspired CZ & Pink CZ Beads Chandelier Earrings ||	  Dainty Yet Noticeable Beauties!  I was expecting them to be a tad bigger, but they are dainty. After staring at them and admiring how well made and pretty they were, I put them on...got compliments ALL day, they glittered and gleamed and looked pretty against my dark hair. They are SO unique and expensive looking! Really beautiful and I am really pleased! And Im usually a BIG earrings girl! These are my dainties! Lovely! <end>
 B000J4J8FU  Large Silver Diamond Cut Hoop Earrings ||	  Silver earrings  Very nice diamond cut hoops, sparkle in the light. Lightweight so they don't damage the ear lobe. <end>  thick posts  I tried to leave a review before but amazon wont let me. These posts are so thick you cant possibly get them into your ears. <end>
 B000J4J8IC  Sterling Silver 25mm Twisted Hoop Earrings ||	  Awesome Earrings  Love these earrings. Nice and solid and beautiful silver. You won't be disappointed. <end>

 B000J4KB5Q  24k Gold Vermeil and Silver Tri Color Three Bangle Set ||	  Not very good vermeil  After wearing them twice the "rose gold" turned gunmetal gray and now the "yellow gold" is slowly disappearing. <end>
 B000J4KB6A  18K Gold over Sterling Silver CZ Square Tennis Bracelet ||	  Bracelet  Given as a gift. The recipient likes it. Shipped on time. I would have been mice if it came in a small box. <end>
 B000J4KBTW  Genuine Rose Quartz Stone Chip One Strand Layer Necklace 32" ||	  Lovely pink quartz necklace indeed !  Pink quartz is a beautiful although modest gemstone and I am grateful for this necklace, quality and color are really worth the transaction. Thank you very much. <end>
 B000J4KC4G  Genuine Swarovski Crystal Necklace ||	  Beautiful as expected but the crystals are VERY small!  I love crystal, and I love Swarovski! But, I have to admit I was disapointed when I received the necklace. The crystals are VERY small. The picture advertised is magnified. I ended up puting the necklace on the rear view mirror in my car. Where I was once disapointed, I am now happy to catch all the beautiful colors, good crystal can bring, whenever I drive. <end>  Love this Necklace!  This necklace is truly beautiful. The crystals aren't tiny, nor are they enormous. That's perfect for me, because I am very short and of an average build; anything larger would overwhelm me. The necklace is easily adjustable to several lengths; I like having it nestled around the base of my neck. The crystals catch the light like tiny prisms and they look especially radiant in sunlight. Even my boyfriend commented on how pretty the necklace is. This great piece of jewelry will attract all kinds of positive attention. <end>  great necklace  Beautiful low priced quality Swarovski crystal necklace. Crystals alone are worth more than the price of the piece. <end>  Tiny and scratchy.  I did not like this necklace. The crystal beads are tiny and they are scratchy. I would not recommend it. It is not worth the money. <end>
 B000J4KCE6  Sterling Silver 4mm Simulated Red Coral Stone Bead Beaded Chain 15-19" Necklace ||	  Great quality  This is a high-quality basic necklace for a great price! The simulated coral has a very striking color and the simple choker style is great for everyday wear. <end>  Beautiful Product  Very inexpensive and fits me nice. I bought one for my daughter as well. She looks beautiful in it. The price is right and Red Coral color is amazing. <end>  This and three others perfect!  I bought four of the 15-19" necklaces from Amazon--two genuine stones and two simulated stones--and all four came just as pictured and described (beautifully vivid colors). The necklaces hang even, the beading is secure, and the lobster clasps are easy to use. They are exactly what I wanted. Thank you SilverSpeck and Amazon! <end>
 B000J4KCEQ  Sterling Silver 4mm Genuine Amethyst Stone Beaded Chain 15-19" Necklace ||	  This and three others perfect!  I bought four of the 15-19" necklaces from Amazon--two genuine stones and two simulated stones--and all four came just as pictured and described (beautifully vivid colors). The necklaces hang even, the beading is secure, and the lobster clasps are easy to use. They are exactly what I wanted. Thank you SilverSpeck and Amazon! <end>  Quality  My niece is spoilt,she loves good quality,but doesn't wannaspend so much so this is at a reasonable price and very pretty.It lasts for a long time,though. <end>
 B000J4KCT6  Sterling Silver 6mm Genuine Onyx Stone Bead Beaded Chain 15-19" Necklace ||	  Necklace  The beads are a bit smaller than I expected, but I am very impressed with the quality-excellent buy! <end>  Very Nice  This necklace was very nice and the beads were of a nice size as well. I will be shopping for the braclet to match. <end>
 B000J4KCZA  Sterling Silver Murano Red Beaded Millefiori Necklace ||	  Murano Necklace  Simply amazing! i feel in love with this piece of jewellery! It is worth all its money. Elegant and can be worn in any occasion. <end>  Sterling Silver Murano Red Beaded Millefiori Necklace  The beads are pretty, but the chain at the top broke the second time I wore it. It was easy to fix, however <end>  murano glass jewelry  i thought this necklace was going to have bigger beads somehow, but it's stil a pretty piece. <end>
 B000J4KFZC  Sterling Silver Square Pink Coral Post Earrings ||	  Square Pink Coral Posts  Absolutely loved 'em, until the second time I wore them, the post broke off. I now attach it with an old earring back. <end>
 B000J4KGE2  Sterling Silver Freshwater Cultured White Pearl Hoop Earrings ||	  Better than pictured.  These earrings are really pretty and a great price. Be gentle with them though. A pearl came off and I put it back on. Then one of my cats got ahold of them and lost half the pieces. I like them enough I'm ordering another pair! I'll keep away from the cat this time! <end>

 B000J4KHSW  Sterling Silver Genuine Amber Stone Disc Bar Bead Dangling Earrings ||	  not real amber?  I love the design of this earrings but I would question the amber part, looks and feels like plastic. This is why I gave only 1 star. Design is great, they look really nice and they add a little spice to Your outfit but what I appreciate the most in jewelry I buy is quality. The amber part in my opinion is not amber and I don't like being cheated. Seller advertises this earrings as amber... i wouldn't be so sure about it. <end>

In fact, I love it now. <end>
 B000J4KMC8  Sterling Silver Puffed 3-D Star Tube Earrings ||	  great for teenager  I bought these for my 16 year old niece and they are now here favorite! <end>
 B000J4KMEG  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Genuine Ruby and Diamond Accent Hoop Earrings ||	  You definitely get what you pay for.  I purchased these earrings from this company directly through Amazon. I was surprised at how quickly they got here, but upon further inspection of the product, I wish they would have spent more time assuring the quality before sending it out.PROS From a distance, the earrings look great.The quality and durability of the gold loop and ear wire is above what I expected -- the ear wire latches into the rest of the loop nicely without bending time after time.The price was unbelievably affordable for a genuine product, even given that it's only Vermeil.CONS On close inspection, one of the rubies has a small chip in front and center of the stone.The rubies aren't as vibrantly red as they are in the item picture -- they are a bit cloudy and have more of a pink hue in real life.The hoops are very petite. Although this is the size that I wanted, I know that some prefer a larger hoops. If you are one of these people, you will be disappointed with this product.In short, the product looks very nice from a distance. No one is going to have their face a foot away from your ear to inspect the earrings, so I'm happy to settle with the slight imperfections. This is a picture perfect example of "you get what you pay for". If you're looking for a lavish, genuine set of earrings guaranteed to be flawless, then this is the wrong set for you. If you're looking for a petite, fun pair of earrings and are willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of quality for price, then I suggest you look into buying this pair. <end>  Vermeil(24ktGoldover Silver) Genuine Ruby and Diamond Hoop Earrings  I just love these earrings, I have had so many comments about them. I wear them with my ring that matches. I never thought I'd find a pair of earrings to go with my ring. I now own 2 different sets of earrings that match 2 different rings. Maybe someday I'll have all matching rings and earrings! I would highly recommend theses to eveyone, except in your own birth stone of course! Didin't really need to know anything about this product before I purchased it, the picture describes it exact. <end>
 B000J4KMUA  14K Gold Dolphin Hoop Earrings ||	  Excellent Quality  The earrings were just what I was looking for. I would like another pair a little larger if that is available. <end>
 B000J4KMVO  Sterling Silver Heart Hoop Earrings ||	  Beautiful earrings  I love these earrings and get compliments all the time on them. They're not too big, not too small and have very strong clasps. (I lost one from a similar pair that wasn't as well made). When I first got mine, one was severly bent and the other was slightly bent, which surprised me because the silver is not flimsy at all. In fact, I couldn't unbend it in the slightest. Not sure if it was mail damage or came that way from the factory, but I returned them and got great service and a replacement pair mailed out within days. <end>  Not enough of a heart shape  I ordered these as a christmas gift for my mom because she loves hoop earrings. They look well made as hoops, but they barely look like hearts at all, if you want something that will stand out these are not it. They are a very subtle heart, too subtle for me. <end>
 B000J4KMYQ  Sterling Silver & Gold Overlay Garnet Filigree Earrings ||	  Pretty garnets  These earrings are quite sturdy, and the contrast between the silver and gold gives them a spark. The garnets are a good size and a pretty wine color. <end>
 B000J4KN0Y  Rose Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Hoop Earrings ||	  VERY THIN  These hoop earrings came nicely packaged but when removed from the baggie, they smelled overwhelmingly like fake metal not at all like sterling silver. The "rose" gold color is almost a copper color rather than the typical rose gold. I own several 14K rose gold pieces of jewelry and hoped these hoop earrings would make a good match. But most of all, these hoops are very very thin and bend very easily. Think very thin copper wires shaped as hoops. The hoops bend as you pull up the post to insert in your ear and bend again as you remove them. Luckily, they bend right back into shape. I think $15 is way too much to spend on these but I will keep them as returning them would be too much of a hassle. <end>  Hoop Earrings  very nice standard hoop earrings, not too small, not too bigh, just fine. The rose color gives it a special chiqueVery prompt shipment. <end>  They look great.  They are a little large but they look great with my hair down. They peak through my hair just enough to tell I'm wearing earrings. <end>  CHEAP  These earrings are so thin and fragile that I don't wear them very often PLUS they are really big. Not very happy with these. <end>  Larger than expected  I could not find a size in the description of these earrings. For the price, I figured they would be an inch or less. They are very thin and over an inch, almost two. I do not care for them, but for the price, will suffice. I only have one rose gold necklace to wear them with. <end>
 B000J4KN18  14K Gold Large Oval Tube Hoop Earrings ||	  14K Gold Large Oval Tubal Hoops Earrings  The product was a LOT smaller than I expected, based on the description. They are definitely NOT Large by any standards. I was highly disappointed in this product. <end>
 B000J4KN22  14K Gold Curved Hoop Earrings ||	  Unsatisfied Customer  When I received the earrings, they were 14K gold, but the size where much smaller than the photo I saw on Amazon.com. Since they stated they regularly retail for $100.00 I expected a much larger size. I will not purchase anything else from Silver Speck again. <end>  Small hoop earrings  The earrings were very nice, but way smaller than advertised. I initially bought them for myself, but ended up giving them to my little girl. The price didn't match the size of what you were buying. These should had been advertised as extra small or for little girls. <end>
 B000J4MJ74  Sterling Silver Simulated Cubic Zirconia Omega Back Earrings ||	  omega back earrings  I specifically purchased these because of the backs. They are exactly what I expected. The weight of the earrings keeps me from wearing them more often. My ears are not used to wearing anything this heavy. The seller is a five star merchant. But I'm going to give the product four stars for no reason other then the weight. <end>  Love these earings!  Ordered these for a wedding...they are great and I am now back to order a second pair for a friend. <end>
 B000J4MJ7E  Sterling silver Genuine Tiger Eye Chandelier Hoop Earrings ||	  Tiger Eye Earrings  These earrings are lovely and my daughter loved them! I bought them for her for Christmas. Both of us were very pleased with them. They were well made and just the right size.I would buy from this seller again. There were no problems at all with this purchase.~S~ <end>
 B000J4MJGA  Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst Chip Earrings ||	  Purchased this to go with braclet  Nice colored stones and it complimented the braclet well. My friend loved it. She likes anything purple and the stones are her birthstones. <end>  They look a little cheap  These are really small and look like a craft project that my niece would make at school. I wouldn't recommend them. <end>  Great Gift  Product arrived earlier than expected and are prettier than the picture. Will be a terrific Christmas gift. Will order again <end>  pretty, comfortable  These earrings are beautiful and they compliment a lot of my outfits. They are comfortable and lightweight and don't irritate my ears. I'd recommend them! <end>  Lavendar very powerful color in the Spirit.  Thank you so much for this product. It is a beautiful color of Lavendar and it is great. So glad I took time to look it up on line and to purchase it. Take care. <end>  Excellent value for the money.  I just wore this pair the other day, everyone that saw them loved them. The color is so delicate; and, looks like real amethyst. I certainly will be buying more of these earrings. The price is definitely right, and they look good, too! <end>  LadyBugReview  I got these for a gift and the receiver loved them and now she will order the bracelet and necklace soon. <end>  Cute and simple  Sometimes I just want a splash of color instead of gold or silver and these earings do the trick. I really enjoy them. <end>  Moms awesome birthday  I bought this item as a part of a 3pc set for my mothers birthday......While she loved the earrings, I myself was a little disappointed with the look to the earrings on two fronts. First off the earrings look stiff, I expected them to dangle a bit but they're straight and stiffer then a stiff on in the morn -_-. and secondly, the color of the chips were really light compared to the other 2 pieces.But all in all my mother didn't mind, and she was quite moved by the gift. <end>  Nice gift  I gifted these to my friend. Luckily for me, she loves purple, so she loved it. Its delicate and very pretty. Would go nicely with a dress or even jeans. Hopefully it wont break easily, cant tell. <end>  Very pretty earrings  These earrings are very nicely made. I bought them for my 12 year old niece for Christmas. They look very cute on her! <end>  delightful  I am absolutely delighted by the Amethyst earings, they go very well with my amethyst necklace that cost considerably more when costed by # of stones. <end>  Excellent for the price!  I bought a pair of these earrings for myself about 5 months ago. They are still in excellent condition, despite multiple wearings, and I am very pleased with them; the silver is still bright and untarnished. I bought three more pairs to give to relatives this Christmas, and they are also delighted with the earrings.The reason I did not give five stars is that the earrings do not look like the picture. Like another reviewer commented, the earrings I received are all the darkest purple; there is not the lovely gradation of tones shown in the photo. Furthermore, the earrings I received do not have the variation in stone shape shown in the photo. It may be that each pair is different, and I just received several similar pairs by coincidence.However, like I said, I am pleased with the product nonetheless, and the price is unbeatable! I would buy more of these. <end>  Nice  nice earings, like the color and the size. happy with the product. would recommend customer to buy this product for young girls <end>  comfortable amethysts  long enough to be jaunty without dragging on my shoulder. comfortable enough to leave in for several days, not heavy. a good purchase! <end>  Cute and inexpensive  Received these as a gift. Love them. They are my birthstone and go with many outfits. Great buy and super cute. <end>  Purple Beauties  I hadn't even gotten 10 feet in the door at work before I received the first of many compliments on my 'gorgeous earrings'. They are indeed stunning - stacked amethysts on a sterling silver wire. They are light on your ears but heavy on the compliments. I would recommend them to anyone. <end>  Amethyst Chip Earrings  I received as a gift the Amethyst Chip necklace and bracelet and I was looking for the earrings. I am always on Amazon.com and I receive emails on any recommendations they send. I received the email for the Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst Chip Earrings and I couldn't have been more surprised and delighted to have found what I was looking for without actually looking. Thanks to Amazon.com and the wonderful company Silverspeck.com I am perfectly satisfied with the product, price and the company. I have already recommended several of my friends to shop there. <end>  very satisfied  Stocking stuffer for my teen age daughter who likes purple -- just as pictured--good color;consistent throughout - a little sparkle from the polished chips -- any bigger and I think they would be too big -- as to breaking, I won't know unitl after Xmas -- got the bracelet also and a very good match--$2.00  how could you miss? <end>  Sturdy, Uniform Color Great Price!  I got these to go with the bracelet, thinking it would make a nice set, and it does. With the low price, I has reservations about quality. I had no reason to worry! The color was uniform, the earrings sturdy, and they matched the bracelet exactly. I would shop with SilverSpeck again! <end>  purple predicament  Yes, they are smaller than pictured, but my pair of earrings have no variation at all. Pick the darkest of the stones and that is the color I got times six. I guess I shouldn't complain considering the cost, but I'd rather pay more and get what is pictured, than a cheap copy. <end>  Lovely Earrings!  I purchased these earings as a gift for a friend of mine and she absolutely adores them! She wears them as often as she can! I can't say enough about how simply beautiful and well-made these earrings are. Silverspeck.com is a great supplier of well-made gorgeous natural stone chip jewelry that is affordable and looks great. If you like purple, get these earings! <end>  Amethyst Crystal Chip stones Earrings  I love these earrings because it looks good on. It's a very nice amethyst. And together with the amethyst crystal chip necklace and bracelet I purchased separately, but as a set, it is a very classy combination. It's also very COLD to the skin when you put it on. Precious stones are cold when you touch them. <end>  Beautiful  I wear these earrings all the time. They are lightweight and really quite beautiful. They seems to be well made. <end>  Looks great in the picture  In reality it looks just like a bunch of cheep stones strung together quickly. Have doubts that it will hold up over time. <end>  Came a Little Late  I ordered these for my mom's birthday last year. The expected delivery date was on her birthday, but they ended up coming a few days after. Other than that, they're very pretty and my mom loves to wear them. The stone color definitely varies. <end>  Nice quality, good size.  Nice medium purple color, not too dark, not too light. Unlike the necklace that looks similar, there is no discomfort caused by these earrings. <end>  A++  Very well made, beautiful, and very affordable. These earrings are a great addition to my jewelry collection. I recommend this purchase. <end>  It's Okay.  I ordered it and I'll wear them sometime, but I'm not in love with them. It's rough looking and cheapish. <end>  Great  Exactly what I wanted. Fast shipping, good packaging.This was a gift, and so far we have had no issues.Great purple color, she loves them <end>  Pretty, But Delicate  I really like these earrings because they have matching bracelets. However, the earrings break very easily. My adult daughter quickly broke two pair. The first pair came apart when she tried to put them in her ears. <end>  Color not Consistent  I know it's the nature of natural stones not to have consistent color, but I didn't like the way these earrings went from light at the top to dark at the bottom. If the bracelet can be made with matching stones, I would think they could make the earrings the same way. <end>
 B000J4MJMY  Sterling Silver X and Oval Genuine Sapphire and Genuine Diamond Accent Earrings ||	  Pretty  Not super impressive in reality. Very pretty, but much smaller than the pictures make you think. The stones are dulled a bit as well. <end>  Great Ship, Nice Gift  Nice item, saved me at Christmas--shippping and tracking allowed me to find this quick, I thought it might have been accidently locked away by the landlord--tracking said go to mailbox, there it was <end>
 B000J4MLFE  Cute .925 Silver Blue Purple HOOP Earrings NR ||	  These are for children  I was mistaken in thinking these were adult size earrings. Evidently the term "cute" in a Silver Speck product name means child's size. I bent the hoop on the one I tried on, and feel sure that it will break soon if I continue to use them. So, while these would be nice understated earrings for a child, they are not for us big people. <end>
 B000J4MLLS  Dangling Simulated Pink Rose Quartz Tear Drop Dangle LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Lovely earrings!  I purchased these earrings to go with a necklace my wife received from her mother at Christmas (eight months prior). My wife says these are lovely earrings and are the perfect length for lever-backs. The rose quartz stones match her necklace even though they came from very different places at different times.Edited on 5/12/11 My wife still loves these earrings. However, she wanted me to note that one of the leverbacks doesn't stay closed all the way anymore. The earrings stay in her ears, but she wonders how secure they are now. She loves them and will be disappointed if she loses one. <end>  Dangling Simulated Pink Rose Quartz Tear Drop Dangle LeverBack Lever Back Earrings  I like the earrings very much and I would buy them again. They also match the necklace that I ordered. <end>
 B000J4MMTE  Sterling Silver Genuine Peridot Earrings ||	  Sterling Silver Genuiune Peridot Earrings  Service was excellent, product is very high quality, I will purchase from this seller again in the future. <end>
 B000J4MN66  Sterling Silver Genuine Diamond Accent and Emerald Stone Flower Earrings ||	  Earring Review  The earrings got in there in time and were packaged just fine. I was disappointed in the quality in that the green stones were very light not dark like in the picture. My daughter still likes them but, I would not purchase from this company again. <end>  Come on they're $20 emeralds!  Yes they are small, yes they are light, but come on they're $20 emeralds?! You can't beat that. MEN  Do NOT I repeat do NOT think you can buy these as a gift and get any credit. But if you're buying them for yourself or a child... they'll work. Still pretty and delicate and like I said, emeralds. <end>  just OK  The stones in the ones I recieved were not uniform, but they were a darker color for the most part. You do get what you pay for, however. I purchased these at half the retail price listed, and would probably do it again at that price. <end>
 B000J4MN6G  Sterling Silver Genuine Diamond Accent and Ruby Stone Flower Earrings ||	  Beautiful studs  These are ideal for an everyday look or if you want a simpler look. Small but noticeable. They are worth the price for sure. <end>  Very nice earrings  They are very pretty earrings. Low cost but it was nice to see that the diamonds and rubies don't look like cheap and plastic-like. <end>  very pretty  I love them. They are very pretty in real life. They are a gift for Christmas, I think my Mom will love them, they are very pretty, not to small, not to big. Nice. <end>
 B000J4MNBQ  Sterling Silver Round Prong Set Simulated Amethyst cz LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  good buy  This is the third pair of earrings that I have bought from this seller, and I have been satisfied with each purchase. I was looking for dark purple amethyst. While I prefer a real stone I wanted to make sure that I got a dark purple stone to match a AA amethyst stone in a pendant I own. The stone is a nice dark purple and is sparkly. The silver is good quality and is sturdy. This was true of the other two pairs of earrings I bought as well. The price is definitely fair. <end>
 B000J4MNUM  Sterling Silver Simulated Brown Cats Eye Tear Drop LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Earrings  Purchase was smooth, easy to find with description. I had been searching for these type of earrings for a long time. <end>
 B000J4MPVY  Sterling Silver Etched Antique Filigree Chandelier Earrings ||	  Pretty, but not as nice as I thought they'd be  My husband bought these for me for Christmas and they are not what I expected based on the product description and photo.The description reads  "Royalty and Elegance emanate from these extravagant sparkling etched Chandelier Earrings." I expected the etching to be on both sides, not just on one, so you have to be careful which earring you put in which ear so that the etching side will face out and not the "back side". The words "royalty", "elegance", and "antique" give the impression that the overall appearance would be consistent with a piece of jewelry that could easily be worn to a prestigious occasion or suitable to wear to your own wedding and that is just not the case. Additionally, the word "chandelier" gives the impression that the two separate tiers are articulated and would hang and move independently (this is elegant), but they are fixed which makes these earrings look cheap and hang awkwardly; they are too large to be fixed. If they were they half the size they are, then a "fixed" chandelier would be acceptable. Admittedly, I couldn't really tell this from the photo, but the language led me to believe that this would be the case. <end>  Real Quality  I just love these earrings, its hard to see the details of the filigree they are a quality earring. <end>
 B000J4MQ04  Sterling Silver 4mm Genuine Soda Lite Stone 6 Bead Beaded Dangle Hook Earrings ||	  Pretty with pricey shipping  I didn't pay enough attention to the shipping costs while checking out, yeaouch. Not nearly as great a deal as it seemed. Product arrived pretty much exactly as pictured. Was properly packed. Pretty little earrings. <end>  Beautiful Sodalite  Another beautiful item from SilverSpeck. I wondered about how fragile they would be with six beads, but they aren't loose at all. The pair I have shows all the beautiful shades of Sodalite. I was so glad to find this style and in one of my favorite stones. <end>
 B000J4MQA4  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Blue Topaz 4mm Round Stud Earrings ||	  Great Birthstone Studs!!  I totally loved these earrings and almost kept them for myself. I purchased as a Christmas gift for my niece whose birthday is in December (topaz birthstone) - Not too big or too small. The color and clarity and shine were all beautiful. They weren't packaged very well - earrings were placed individually in a small plastic zip-lock type bag. The jewelry bag included wasn't very nice so I didn't use it and had to purchase a separate box for presentation and gift wrapping. <end>
 B000J4MQIQ  18K Gold over Sterling Silver CZ Rectangle Filigree Leverback Earrings ||	  lacking in details  On line the earrings look as though they had small beads circling the stones and it looked well defined. With the actual earrings the details were less than crisp and precise. The stones look smaller on the earrings and the actual earrings are slightly over sized for my taste. <end>
 B000J4MQQ8  Sterling Silver Thick C Shape Sleek Hoop Earrings ||	  change of heart  When these arrived I was disappointed to see that they were smaller than I had imagined. I thought of sending them back but decided to try them out. I have since fallen in love with them. They actually have a great look on the ear and show up much better than I anticipated. Very pleased. <end>
 B000J4MQSG  14K Gold Unique Twisted Earrings ||	  liked it but lost it.  well i thought these looked interesting, and they were.I expected a little bit more of effect than what i got, but that;s not saying it's bad. they were cute.I say were cause the very first day i wore it one side snagged on my clothing and was lost ( be very careful with the snaps )....still hope i find it back, never wore it out so don't know what others thought. Wish they were a little thicker but at the same time they are not flimsy...just think they would have had a bigger WOW factor if they were. <end>
 B000J4MTGU  Sardelli - 14k Gold Polished Reversible Cubic Zirconia & 3mm Ball Earrings ||	  Best Ever  I lost one of the earrings so i purchased another set. I have 4 piercings on my ear and these look elegant, can be worn as zircon or gold studs, and have remained securely on my ear for 3 years now. <end>
 B000J4WQLI  Genuine Gemstone 5-Stone Peridot, Amethyst, Blue Topaz, Garnet, and Citrine 10K Yellow Gold Ring Size 8.5 ||	  very disappointed  I used gift cards from family to purchase this ring. I had it on for one day & the Citrine stone fell out. I just think the quality of this ring is poor, rough edges on the gold, and stones that were not set right. <end>
 B000J5OW6E  Genuine Gemstone 5-Stone 2.4cttw Peridot 10K White Gold Ring Size 8.5 ||	  pretty ring, terrible band  The stones on this ring are a nice size and color. Unfortunately, the band is so narrow and so thin that it bends just putting it over your knuckle. The people were very nice and prompt issuing the refund when I returned it, but the band was so flimsy that you couldn't do anything to fix it. <end>  Horribly thin band, beautiful ring otherwise  As the previous reviewer stated, the band on this ring is just intolerably thin. The first ring I received was so beautiful that I hoped the crumpled band was an aberration, so I contacted the company and sent it back for a replacement. They were very courteous and prompt in all communications. Unfortunately, the second ring also had a hair-thin band, but at least it wasn't already crumpled in the box! I'm afraid to wear it; it's so thin. But it's so beautiful and relatively inexpensive that I decided to keep it, and maybe look into getting the band reinforced -- although that will likely cost more than the ring did. <end>
 B000J5PZMO  Kathy's Modern Design Garnet and Peridot Earrings ||	  SherryB  I love these. A little small, but they match a bracelet that a friend gave me so I wore it for Christmas. Well made and nice seller. <end>
 B000J5ZE84  Celtic Symbol Belly Button Ring ||	  Cool, but . . .  My wife really liked this gift, it looked very cool, but the little swirley dangely thing broke off after a month or two. <end>
 B000J61RTI  Sterling Silver Black Genuine Sapphire and Genuine Diamond Accent X and Oval Pendant ||	  nice  nice pendant, larger then i expected but a good size still. Nice addition to my collection <end>
 B000J6BSM4  14KWG Diamond Hoop Earrings ||	  Very nice earrings  I was very pleased with this purchase.These earrings are very simple yet elegant.They could be worn with jeans or to a more dressed up occasion.A good choice for the price. <end>
 B000J6DGOW  Silver Amethyst Cross Pendant ||	  Great birthday present  I bought two of the silver amethyst cross pendants for birthday presents for friends with February birthdays--theur birthstone is amethyst. Both friends were thrilled with the crosses. They were at a good price, and made my friends happy. What more could I ask for? <end>
 B000J6E79K  XY1183 14k White Gold Polished 1.50mm Tube Endless Hoop Earrings 20mm Diameter ||	  so disappointed and it was a gift i requested  When the item came they were soo tiny and thin, i thought they were too childs pinky rings. I couldn't believe how the image is soo misleading to you. I would prefer all jewelry be described by inches not mm. <end>  Too Big  I under-estimated the size of these earrings. I was looking for very small hoops so I returned them. The company was great about the return. I would buy from them again. <end>
 B000J6F938  Silver Diamond Circle Bracelet ||	  A gorgeous bracelet, but measure your wrist  I loved this bracelet so much after receiving it for Mother's Day, that I bought a second one when the first fell off in a parking lot somewhere. It turns out it fell off because it was too long for my wrist, but the seller was willing to have it shortened for a small fee.I'm so happy to have the bracelet again, and I always get wonderful compliments on it. <end>
 B000J9Z3KO  Pugster 316l Surgical Steel Belly Navel Ring Orange Crystal Marijuana Leaf Fashion November Belly Navel Ring Body Jewelry ||	  Awesome product  SI wore this belly ring every single day for about 6 months. It never turned colors or broke. It is gorgeous and I received many compliments. <end>
 B000JBZI6Q  Pugster Heart Red Fringe Pattern Earrings For Women ||	  Pugster Blue Freshwater pearl titanium chandeliergrey  I for myself, was abit disappointed that on the earring- there was no titanium label- but other than that the pearl was lovely and delicate. the party i bought the sets of earring s for - is happy- i do hope that they are titanium -that she does not have a reaction. she only can use titanium- <end>
 B000JCANUQ  Goldtone Metal Curb-Link Necklace and Pierced Earring Set ||	  BEAUTIFUL!  I PURCHASED THIS GOLDTONE METAL CURB-LINK NECKLACE AND PIERCED EARRING SET FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS. I THINK THEY LOOK GREAT FOR THE PRICE. <end>
 B000JCHECQ  PalmBeach Jewelry Smoky Quartz 18k Gold Over Sterling Silver Dangle Earrings ||	  Too Big  The earrings are as it looks at the picture. And the size was as indicated. I bought it for the price per carat weights, and it is as expected. But it was bigger & bulkier than I thought, and it is not suitable for every day use. It will work for suit or dress on special occasion, but the earrings are too heavy so it hurts my ear if I wear it for any extended period of time. In addition, I had to change the back as the small friction back cannot hold the earrings weight. <end>
 B000JCHHQO  Pink Topaz Bracelet W/ Diamond 10K White Gold Links ||	  Beautiful bracelet  I bought this bracelet to match my earrings and pendat for my sister's wedding and it was everything I hoped. The clasp I sturdy, workmanshinp is beautiful and the stones are a clear sparkly pink. I love it!! <end>
 B000JCLKYE  14K White Gold 1/10 ct. Diamond Initial "C" Pendant with Chain ||	  Beautiful necklace, great price!  I couldn't be more pleased with this necklace. The diamonds shine and it is absolutely stunning. Love the way it was packaged. This seller is the BEST!!!! <end>
 B000JD264G  Sterling Silver Black Onyx Checker Cut Pendant, 18" ||	  It grows on you  The other reviewer was very right in that the size is HUGE. And I mean HUGE. I'm only 5' and barely 100lbs and when I opened this up, I was so hesitate and undececeive about returning it or not. The thing is huge both length wise and width wise.As I was debating it, for Christmas eve, which also happened to be my birthday, I wore a black knee length dress that had a deep V neck with a black cardigan on top, and decided to give the necklace a try. It worked well. I didnt really go out, just family coming over, but I received plenty of compliments from members of my family who hardly gives 'em....and one who even asked me for it! lol So I guess it's a good buy!It really is unique though and you wont be finding the same pendent on someone else! lolBut again as the other reviewer state, besides a v-neck shirt/dress, I wouldnt know what else to wear it with...I also wish the chain was a bit shorter... as I'm a petite person myself and would rather have the pendent sit further up my neck...Otherwise though, I'm glad I purchased it as it is unique. <end>  very big!!  This is a nice pendant if you are looking for a "piece" like no other. If you are looking for a little black pendant that you can wear with everything, this isn't for you.I like it so far with plain black low v neck shirts or a turtleneck. <end>
 B000JD2664  Sterling Silver Flower Link Bracelet, 7.5" ||	  This bracelet is ugly - nothing like the picture  The flowers on this bracelet are quite large - the picture doesn't accurately depict it. There is nothing dainty about this piece. I would NOT pay the full price listed on Amazon, and I don't feel it is worth the price I paid either ($49). The other thing I don't like about this bracelet is the large gap between the flowers, where the clasp attaches. There are needless links that create this space and make it quite unattractive. <end>
 B000JDWSJE  7.5" or 8" Heavy 47gram Sterling Silver Large Blue Chalcedony Cabochon Gemstone Toggle Bracelet Gift Boxed ||	  it is large as described  The bracelet is large the stone on either end of the bracelet is a lighter colour, which some people might find slightly irritating, but it is still good value. I thought it had foxtail chains on either end, but it hasn't, it has silver rings. It is nice though. <end>
 B000JE7EF6  Antique Beaded Style Diamond (.05 ctw) Cross Pendant in White Gold ||	  Pretty and delicate but small  My husband bought this for me for Christmas. The detail on this piece is very beautiful and delicate, but it is also small in size. As a result, you have to be very close to see its beauty. It seemed bigger in the picture. <end>
 B000JEA7PA  Diamond (.10 ctw) Jewish Chai Pendant in 14K Yellow Gold with 16in. chain ||	  Service is Slow!  Took longer than projected by vendor to ship it. I had to send an email inquiry to get them moving. <end>
 B000JEC3ZM  Diamond Love-Knot Pendant in 14K White Gold ||	  My daughter loved the diamond love-knot pendant  My daughter had seen this pendant and my husband and I tried to discourage her from wanting it because we didn't know that it would be what she really wanted. We were afraid it would be really tiny and she'd be unhappy with it. However, she loved it and it was perfect! <end>
 B000JEIOMS  10k Yellow Gold Heart Drop Necklace, 17" ||	  THIS ITEM REALLY SURPRISE ME!  THIS NECKLACE IS DIAMOND CUT AND VERY PRETTY. I BROUGHT SEVERAL OF THEM FOR GIFTS AND NOW I MIGHT KEEP ONE FOR MYSELF. THE HEART REALLY ISN'T THAT BIG BUT THE DROP OF THE NECKLACE IS JUST RIGHT, IT'S VERY CUTE NOT TO FLASHY AND COULD BE WORN TO THE OFFICE OR FOR NIGHT ON THE TOWN. I THINK THIS IS A NICE LITTLE NECKLACE IF YOU DECIDE TO GET THIS ONE YOU WILL BE SURPRISE ALSO. <end>  left much to be desired  To be honest, it is a cut chain.But the chain is very fine, and it came VERY tangled,i spent about half an hour trying to get it right...and it being so fine made it even more frail and annoying to untangle. But it is pretty and very feminine. Would give 3.5 stars but option not available. So if you don't mind a thin chain go for it it's lovely. <end>  Delicate or flimsy, subtle or microscopic, take your pick  This is pretty, but really, really small. I bought it as a gift for someone who can pull off dainty, and it's not like I *didn't* expect delicate, but I didn't process what the given dimensions meant when I ordered it. (Okay, so maybe I was also in a Christmas present-buying panic. I didn't say it wasn't my fault.)Anyway, pull out a ruler and see just how small 12 millimeters really is, just so you know what you're getting. <end>
 B000JEJSNW  Sterling Silver Citrine Ring, Size 7 ||	  Gorgeous!  This is a really nice piece for the price. It doesn't look like junk jewelry at all. <end>
 B000JF4GKG  13th Birthday Gift - Thirteen Wishes Birthday Bracelet ||	  Happy 13th  This bracelet was an extra touch to a special girls's 13th birthday gift. I like it so much, I'm about to buy another for the next teen-ager in our family. <end>
 B000JFHITC  Southern Enterprises VM5062C WallMount Mirror Jewelry Armoire ||	  LOVE this ...mad I waited so long to order it  I have just received this piece last week and I must say it's much bigger in person than I thought it would be. I am so excited to hang this piece. Waiting for the hubby to hang it. The inside is so nice. I can't wait to place all my jewelry in it. I thought the quality was much better than I expected and would definitely recommend. <end>  Very Happy with Purchase  I love this armoire. I wish it had more room for earrings, but I knew it didn't have a ton of earring space from the photo. Most of my jewelry fits in here and I like how there are a lot of hooks. This fits on the wall behind my bedroom door and is thin enough that the door still opens all the way. This was a little difficult to hang up- you really need two people- 1 to hold it and one to drill it. I used my own anchors because I thought they were stronger than the ones that were included. The armoire locks, too, which is something I didn't realize, so that's cool too- keeps kiddie hands out of your jewelry! <end>  Handy  I gave this item four stars because the finishing inside was a little rough and the mounted strips for hanging earrings look warped. All in all, though, it is a great piece for the price. I have mounted it inside a walk-in closet.The cabinet holds a lot of jewelry efficiently, and the mirrored door closes well. I like it that it can be locked, too, and comes with two keys. I did not receive instructions with the unit as described by another buyer. I mounted it with the hardware included with the piece and although the three screws and anchors seem a little lightweight for the piece, it seems to be holding okay. <end>  Nice and big  If you want something with a lot of storage for necklaces this it it! Take the door off to hang it. The door with the mirror is most of the weight. The finish could have been better and thats why I gave it 4 stars. Its not bad but it I don't see 178 dollars worth of a product. This is definitely a supply and demand price point. Seriously... how many people do you know with something like this? If they have a big jewelry box its on the floor, and a smaller one is on the dresser or table. Wall mount is a smaller niche and they make up for that in price I guess. <end>  Space saver and convenient!  I wanted something like this for years. Great to have all my jewelry in one place and the mirror for one last glance before I'm out the door. Not much earring space so I removed the ring holders and put small dowell rods in the space to accommodate my long earrings. It is just perfect! Great gift for any woman! <end>  Simple and elegant  I was looking for a wall mirror and came across this jewelry armoire. I'm glad I purchase this. It's blends nicely with my contemporary style and holds more than enough of my jewelry with the slots and hooks inside. It even comes with two sets of keys for locking purposes. I definitely recommend this! No longer do I have to dig through my jewelry box and untangle my necklaces. This holds them very nicely and I can easily browse through my selection of jewelry. <end>  beaware of the nail tip scratch your wall and not matching wall anchor  While I was trying to mount the Jewelry mirror on the wall (doing some leveling and adjusting work), one of the tip of the nail which located at the edge and the back of the box made a lot of scratches on the wall. It is not supposed to be stick out from the box - badly quality control. After mounting the mirror on the wall, I found the two screws with the wall anchor is not really matched because the mirror was very loose on this two screws (no problem on the third screw because it was on the wall stud). I can easily take out the wall anchor after taking out the jewelry mirror and now I need to replace a better wall anchor and/or screw!! Finally, I made a call and nicely complain to the SEI and they hand up on me!!! Okay, the jewelry mirror may still good to use but just be aware the above problem. <end>  Wife loves it! with one exception...  Got this for my wife for Christmas. I actually purchased the surface wall mount but installed it inset into the wall quite easily behind the bedroom door. just located the edge of the two studs, traced the outline on the wall board, cut it out with a razor knife, shimed it between the studs as needed and attached it to the studs with four screws. My wife actually asked for it to be out from the wall because of her nails, so I remounted it protruding 1.5 inches and put a spackle bead around the cut edge. Looks great and its hidden when the bedroom door is open. NOW the exception, I'm currently searching for some type of earring holder that will display her earrings inside. Otherwise, very pleased with the product, good construction, nice interior work, and it makes my wife happy. <end>  Fantastic  It was a Christmas present for my wife and she's ecstatic about it. So, when she's happy, I'm happy.The packaging it came in was great. The product is of good quality. The installation was easy. It took me about 30 minutes at most. That was to relocate a picture, towel bar and then mount the cabinet. One person on here advised to remove the door prior to mounting. I did that and it made it a whole lot easier. The door is pretty heavy because of the mirror. Good product. I'd do it again. <end>  Love this one  I think this is a well made jewelry armoire. I finally have a place to put things where I can easily find them. <end>  She loves it!  Bought this armoire for my wife for her b-day and hung it on the wall and she is loving it! Seems to be very sturdy and well made! And she loves the fact that she can lock it if she wants to keep the kids out of it! <end>  Great jewelry organizer  I really like this item. It has lots of room and hooks in it to keep necklaces untangled. It is very heavy and sturdy. I used a few extra screws to mount it to the wall as I wasn't sure the three that came with it would support the weight. I wish it had more spaces for hanging earrings but was able to add my own to make enough room. This is a nice looking product and a great way to keep jewelry organized! <end>
 B000JI7HCC  Ultrasonic Cleaner ||	  Squeaky Clean jewelry  Works so well that it CAN shake the diamonds right out of the setting!... Be sure to use the plastic basket...I had a baguette fall out of my wedding ring ($130 repair, cause I saw the stone and took it with me)...and a marquee diamond loosened from another band...($65 repair).... Very expensive to have jeweller repair your items... So far, my diamond earrings, 2 sets of two, have no incidence or loosening...Cleans chrome razor handles, hairbrushes, watch bands, and almost any other sturdy item that is difficultly crudded up, long as it will fit in the basin tub... Uses plain water to clean, if desired add one tiny drop of shampoo...rinse after use, wipe clean with a dry towel...I would buy again, but stress the importance of stoned settings being placed in the plastic basket that comes with it...I use the device once every two months on average <end>  Why is this so fragile??  I give two stars out of kindness. The cleaner does clean well, however, minutes after opening it and taking it out of the box, the plastic on the lid cracked. I've used it possibly 10 times now and every time the crack on the lid webbed out more and more. Today, on the 11th use, the lid broke off completely. Now, before accuse me of manhandling the machine in order to break it, you should know that I store it under the sink and gently lift it out from under the sink with each use (realizing how fragile it was with the first use). So now it's completely unusable. <end>  Works great!  I was nervous about these things because people have said that it can vibrate the diamonds/loose on a ring....but after using it I love it. I use it on my wedding band and engagement ring which has pave diamonds all the time and never had any problems. I would definately recommend this product!!! <end>  Sparkling!  Excellent product - does just what it says it will do if you follow the instructions. My jewellery is clean and sparkly and keeps clean as long as it did when professionally cleaned by a jeweller! My jewellery looks like new again and a weekly or fortnightly clean keeps it that way - Brilliant! <end>  ultrasonic cleaner  Item was purchased as a gift for my wife. She is very happy with this product. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive sonic cleaner. <end>  mrsgong  I like my jewelry cleaner. It is worth the money I paid for it as my jewelry looks much better today than it did before Christmas. Also, it is an unusual, but practical gift. <end>  I love this product.  My husband added princess cut diamonds to my solitare and he was constantly having to take it to the jeweler's because I'm obsessive about the shininess. With this product, the only time I get it cleaned by the jeweler is when I take it in for them to check the prongs and stones. <end>  Very good jewelry cleaner.  Just got this cleaner for my wife's bday. Have already cleaned her ring and earings several times-they look great after each use. Threw my watch in there and the cleaning solution looked like mud afterwards--really cleans the hell outa that jewelry. Unit is durable, easy to operate, and fairly small. Highly recommend. <end>
 B000JIHJD4  Personalized Egyptian Sterling Silver Cartouche - Solid Style ||	  A beautiful piece of jewelry  I bought this for my granddaughter and am truly delighted. I have never dealt with a better company than Discoveries. They bent over backwards to insure prompt delivery and they could not have been nicer. The quality is teriffic, the price is fair, the shipping is prompt and the customer service was excellent. What more could you ask for? <end>  This was a gift from my boyfriend...  I love this pendant. Everyone who has seen it thinks it very unusual and pretty. My boyfriend was upset at first when he realized it didn't ship with a chain but I had saw it didn't list that when I put it on my wishlist months ago. So be aware if you buy it- no chain, just the pendant. The fact that it's actually made in Eygpt just makes it even more special. It's one of my favorite pieces of jewelry. <end>  Perfect!  I bought these the first week of December as a birthday present for a co-worker. Her birthday was the last week of December so I was very worried that I wouldn't receive this item in time! Boy was I wrong! The cartouche arrived in a couple weeks, beautifully packaged and quite well made! The best part was the price (around $40) which was significantly cheaper than other vendors were offering at the time. Again, I was a bit concerned, but I have to say I was extremely pleased with the vendor and this purchase! I would definitely order from them again...if I only knew someone else looking for a silver cartouche! <end>  Customer for life!  First off, I just wanted to say THANK YOU! To the wonderful lady from Discoveries. I ordered a pendant for my mother-in-law about a week before x-mas knowing that it would not get here until some time in Jan. The next morning I received a phone call from the lady from discoveries informing me that the pendant wouldn't make it until x-mas (which of course I already knew.) She then told me that she did have the name I wanted available in another design. (Which turned out to be the design I wanted in the first place. I had ordered wrong!) She shipped it out the day we spoke and I received the pendant the very next day! Talk about fast shipping! The pendant and chain were beautiful and my mother-in-law loved it. She has called us 3 times so far to thank us! After seeing the work and dealing with the company, I am absolutely going to buy from them again. <end>  As discribed!  The product shipped & arrived way before it was excpected to which was a nice surprise! It is very well made, polished & the individual characters are easy to see/read .... i'm happy with my purchase! Thank you! <end>  Great purchase!  The item is just as described. The characters are carefully wrought and the cartouche is beautiful. They sent it in a small box with a pouch and a tiny pampleth explaining what a cartouche was, explaining the hyeroglyphic alphabet and finally, giving you the alphabet. What surprised me was that the item got here before I thought it would! I definitely recommend ordering. I didn't contact the seller, but they were quick! <end>  Beautiful cartouche and excellent service  )  I knew I wanted to give my daughter something special for her 8th grade graduation, something she would have forever. She wants to be an Egyptologist, and when I found Discoveries on Amazon, I knew I had found exactly the right gift. I ordered a personalized silver cartouche for her, but waited a little too long to order it to get it in time for graduation. I contacted Discoveries and they could not have been nicer to work with. I was advised that they would do everything they could to get it to me in time. Guess what arrived two days early???? My daughter LOVES her cartouche and wears it EVERY day. Some of the other kids were bragging about getting an iPh*ne for graduation, but how many of them will still have their graduation gift in a few years? My girl will have her cartouche forever, and couldn't be happier. <end>  love it  I love my necklace! I am very satisfied with it and wear it almost everyday! Thank you so much for making it and sending it to me! <end>  Beautiful piece  As a guy who is not really into any jewelry.. I figured I'd buy something just for nights on the town but I find myself wearing this every day. It's a real eye catcher and it's very unique. Just be advised that this does not come with a chain which is not a big deal for me because I'd rather they not Include one Anyway and save us the $20+ so we could actually go to a jewelry store and invest in a nice chain. Very satisfied with my order. Shipping was fast too. <end>  sexy  Wonderful cartouche, looks sexy, feels sexy, looks GREAT on my beau and glad that it came from Egypt.....Pray for peace !!!Great customer service at the company <end>  Excellent  Excellent service and a beautiful product. We ordered this necklace for our daughter a couple of weeks before Christmas and didn't expect to recieve it until after the New Year. It arrived on Dec. 23rd! Our daughter LOVES it only removing it when necessary. <end>  Great company - nice service and responses  I was very pleased with the service I received from Discoveries Egyptian Imports. I was concerned about the name going on the pendant but they responded a couple of times and made the cartouche the way I wanted. The piece seems well made and I am happy with it. It came within 2 weeks of ordering it, as well, ahead of schedule. I will definitely consider ordering again from this company. <end>
 B000JIJTNW  10k White Gold Emerald and Diamond Ring, Size 7 ||	  pretty ring  The ring came in a timely manner. It is very comparable to rings found in retail stores. I only wish it had come in more sizes. I had to go get the ring sized up and that took about two weeks but now I wear it every day.  ) <end>
 B000JIMZ56  10k White Gold Ruby and Diamond Ring, Size 6 ||	  Looks good  looks like the picture, gems on smaller size but I expected it and thought it would look well on dainty finger and it did <end>  Lovely ring!  Very nicely created ring with beautiful gems that have alot of sparkle. I purchased it to replace my wedding band (rubies are for my baby boy born in July) and it has worked very nicely. Great buy for your money! <end>
 B000JJDWA2  14k White Gold Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings ||	  14k White gold CZ earrings  The earrings are very pretty. My only negative comment is that the backings that hold on the earrings are entirely too small. We will have to replace them with larger backings. It is ashame to buy a product; then to have to go back to a jewlery store to to replace parts that are inferior. <end>
 B000JJJCQA  18k White Gold Princess Cut Diamond Solitaire Pendant (3/4ct , H-I, SI2) ||	  Problems with Amazon  It's disheartening when one orders a product from Amazon, and then finds that the order is cancelled. Seems that Amazon dangles enticing deals and prices as a form of loss-leader to get people to use the site - but this is foolish - it only upsets customers who may begin looking elsewhere for their ecommerce needs. <end>
 B000JJLGHI  Boma Rectangle Mother of Pearl Ring (size  8) ||	  Really love this ring!  This ring is true to size and is really well made. The mother of pearl is a good quality and the stone stands a little higher than the silver. It is a great value for the price! <end>
 B000JJLKB0  14K Flag Graduation Cap Pend - GH15173 ||	  A pretty little thing  I think I thought this might be a bit bigger, but it was quite a nice little piece. It works well on a chain I got a while ago. This is quite a nice little gift for any graduate. But not for everyone. <end>
 B000JJQM4A  3 Diamond Men's Ring 1/2 ct. in 14K White Gold ||	  Outstanding service.  I purchased this item and the item was delivered promptly and sized to my specifications. Upon recieving this item I had it appraised and it appraised 4 approximately what it was advertized to appraise 4. Thank you and sorry about the delay on the feed back!!! <end>
 B000JJUWXW  14K White Gold 1 1/4 ct. Diamond Fashion Ring ||	  Gorgeous ring  Great size, great sparkle. The outer lines of the actual ring are a bit more irregular than in the picture but I think that is beautiful. I am very happy with it. <end>  This is my wedding ring!!!  I shopped around for months trying to find the perfect diamond wedding band. I settled on this one because the width of the band was just right and the price was good. I was worried that the price was "too good"... until I had my ring appraised at my local jewelry store. It appraised at $2500.00 and that says it all! <end>
 B000JJUZ4I  3 Diamond Princess Cut Men's Ring 1/4 ct. in 14K White Gold ||	  Excellent  My husband is ecstatic with his wedding ring. It's masculine with a little bit of "something" without being too flashy. <end>
 B000JK2RG6  16 Inch Long 2.0mm Diameter Black Leather Cord Necklace w/Sterling Silver Clasp ||	  silver was tarnish  they send me a piece of junk. The silver part of the cord was so tarnish and it was rusted,how can they send me one looking like this? i ended up throwing it out. i have no time to send it back. i don't think i will be ordering from this vendor again. <end>
 B000JKEBG0  Gold Religious Four-Way Cross Pendant Necklace 24" ||	  gold Laura Ingrham cross  I hate giving two stars to a religious item, but i bought 5 of these thinking I would give them to some of my grandkids. I wore one for a month, it started to wear where the cross touched my body. I am totally surprised and decided not to give them out. I recommend finding a solid gold cross, something with real value. <end>
 B000JKKOMK  Turquoise and Coral Inlaid Bear Paw Ring, Size 7.5, #10519 ||	  looks cool...  this product looks amazing, but if you look closely you'll see that it's cracked and actually looks like it's been pieced back together...whats going on here? <end>
 B000JKMSTM  Southwestern Style Wolf Paw Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise and Coral Chip Inlay for Men or Women, Size 8, #10519 ||	  Wonderful Present  I purchased this ring for my sweetheart for Valentine's day. He loved it! The paw-prints are very small, but that makes them all the more noticeable, and makes the ring much nicer to wear... subtle, rather than gaudy. I highly recommend it. <end>  Bear Paw Ring  The ring is wonderful!!!!!!! It is a little heavier than I expected, but I'm extremely pleased it is. It is GORGEOUS!! I have gotten dozens of compliments in the short time I've had the ring. <end>  well  well,I received this ring and love it. However, it is not exactly like the one I thought it should be ~~~~However, it is fine I think~ <end>
 B000JL7AWG  Duck Charm - XCH207 ||	  Rubber Duck Charm  I ordered this charm to give as a gift. Unfortunately, the charm was a smaller then anticipated and smaller than the photo so I felt a little cheezy and got an additional gift. Otherwise the product is as described. I had o problems with the seller and would order from the seller again. Delivery was quick and well packaged. <end>
 B000JLHME2  Amazon.com  Tuxedo Cufflinks and Studs - Silver Basket Weave  Clothing ||	  Not satisfy  Not satisfyItems that I bought was not the same that I saw in the website, the cufflink should be all one color which is silver and new, what I received its used and tow color. I am sorry to say that but I am not satisfied.Thanks, <end>
 B000JLNIH2  Avon Sterling Silver Lavender Chalcedony and CZ Earrings ||	  Stunning little Earrings!  I was more than pleased when I saw these earrings in person.....they are smaller earrings but you can notice them because they are so stunning and the colors are wonderful together. <end>
 B000JM6J6S  Stainless Steel Belt Buckle Mesh Bracelet, 7.5 inch long ||	  7.5" Surgical Steel Belt Buckle Bracelet  Wow. This is one of my all-time favorite bracelets. I wear it every single day. The bracelet itself is very flexible, and you don't feel that you have to struggle to put it on. It has a watch feel but without the face. I love it. <end>  Great bracelet! Fast receipt!  I purchased 2 of these bracelets; one for a gift and the other for myself. My friend's BD isn't until May, but I'm not going to hold off giving it to her. I want to wear mine now. As another review or two mentioned, the bracelet looks much more expensive than it is. It feels very comfortable to wear (very important to me) and can be adjusted because it's a true buckle...6 different settings. The smaller settings would even fit a little girl. The mesh doesn't have any sharp points like some mesh can. I'm thinking of ordering some more; this may be my go-to gift for 2013. Also, I ordered this on a Friday at 8 PM Eastern and received it on Monday via standard (free!) shipping. Thanks, Sabrina Silver! <end>  Love it.  You'd think the item would be fragile but it's actually surprisingly flexible. This is a must buy if you like this. <end>  Great looking...  I really wanted to keep this bracelet. I normally wear 7.5" bracelets but since this one is a little thicker than usual...it was too small and I have to reluctantly return it. Sabrina Silver were very accommodating and answered the email re  returning it very quickly and professionally. I found no issues with the clasp or the bands keeping the bracelet held down but again, that could be because it was too small. Recommended if you normally wear a sz 7.0" bracelet. <end>  AWESOME!!!!!!  this bracelet is an awesome gift. at such a low price with an expensive look, you cant fo wrong!! i bought this for myself to match my tiffany mesh ring and it goes perfect!! everyone thinks its from tiffany! couldnt be happier.. low price, high end appearance & fast delivery. cant go wrong  ) <end>  Just as it looks!  I love it! I have another bracelet that I had for about four years that unfortunately broke, so I was looking for something like an upgrade. I liked that this bracelet was simple and clean like sterling silver tends to be, but still has the unique belt-buckle touch that adds a nice addition to it. It's stylish without being obnoxious and it fits very well. Plus, I ordered it on Friday and got it on Monday, which is saying something considering the Holiday Rush I ordered it during. Even Amazon didn't realize it shipped so soon!? <end>  Love this bracelet!  This bracelet came today, and it's very pretty. Feels sturdy and well-made. I'm considering buying a few more as gifts. I didn't know this before purchasing, but the bracelet has two clear "bands" on it that hold the guides in place. You can set them wherever you want so the strap part doesn't come out from under the guides and flap around on you. Even better, Sabrina Silver got the bracelet to me very quickly--I ordered on Friday, and received it on Monday. <end>  Great Gift Idea!  I bought this as a gift for a woman who has a collection of buckle style jewelry. It's a great gift, looks nice and a good product. <end>  Really sharp little item!  I got this as to give as a little present. It is a really nice item, especiallyfor the price. It looks great on my Lady! She says it is comfortable andhas gotten several compliments on it at the office. <end>  Buckle won't work  I like the looks of it, but once I tried wearing it the buckle would continue to open and the end would stick up/out. The little brackets used to hold down the end that is pulled through the buckle kept sliding as well, so it wouldn't stay put. I think I have to return it! <end>
 B000JN6BQU  Stunning! 14k White-gold Pair 05.00MM= (1 CT TW) Solitaire Lever Back Earrings ||	  Classy  I have been wanting leverback earrings for awhile now and these hit the mark. The only reason for 4 stars is I'm not sure how to clean them and they hang a little low. I'm nervous about putting them in cleaning solution because of the leverback mechanism. All in all they are pretty and a good value considering they are in white gold and not silver. Now I just need some hoops? <end>
 B000JP09FW  Sterling Silver Celtic Triskele Knot on Deep Forest Green Glass Disc Slide Pendant ||	  Protection  I really like this pendent as I use it as a shield, and I wear a cross with it, and I don't do any where without it. It suits me. <end>

 B000JRAHBG  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot cut-out Men's Ring Flawless Quality 5/16 inch wide, sizes 9 to 14 ||	  Great Gift!  I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. The ring is sturdy and very nicely made, especially for this price. I was impressed as soon as I opened the package. Plus, my boyfriend loved the ring and has worn it every day since Christmas. <end>  Love it!  It's hard to find a size 14 ring and I am so glad that I found this one! It's a heavy weight and my boyfriend wears it all the time. My only wish is that the pattern went all the way around. It's hard to see but the knot work is in 3 separate parts to make the complete ring. <end>  very nice  It's a very nice and heavy ring, and the cut out design is very cool. Because it's silver the details on the lines aren't as sharp as they could be, but it gives it a hand made feel. <end>
 B000JRDANI  Sterling silver braided bracelet, 'Dragon Art' ||	  Beautiful!  this bracelet is my absolute favorite. so far! i plan on buying more. i first saw them in Nat Geo magazine and was drawn in automatically. its hand made in Thailand and is very good quality. and purchasing this bracelet or anything from Novica helps support the people who made it. <end>
 B000JRG864  Sterling Silver Chain Link cut-out Men's Ring Flawless Quality finish 3/8 inch wide, sizes 9 to 14 ||	  Heavy and Durable  This ring just arrived-When I took it out of the box I was pleasantly surprised on much weight this ring has.Very shiny and well made. I think due to its thickness its a bit tight- I would suggest ordering a size up. Another thing to note is that the underside of the ring- the side that touches your finder- is not completely smoothed. Therefore rotating the ring is not perfectly smooth and it does catch ur finger, though not painful.I bought two of these rings as a present for my S.O. to express our link to each other. <end>
 B000JRG8PK  Sterling Silver Flawless Quality Celtic Knot Men's Ring 5/16 inch wide, sizes 9 to 14 ||	  Beautiful Ring!!

I will certainly use Sabrina Silver again! <end>
 B000JRM6KG  Three Stone Princess Cut Diamond Ring 1/4ctw in White Gold - Size 8 ||	  Great Ring!  I purchased this as an engagement ring for my girlfriend. The ring arrived very quickly and was very beautiful. It is not a big ring but then again I didn't expect it to be. It is perfect for what I wanted it for. Quality of the ring looks great, no visible problems what-so-ever. I would recommend this ring to anyone looking for a great gift or engagement ring that won't break the bank. <end>  beautiful  I love it! it is really so beautiful. I got it almost a week sooner than the estimate they gave me and it is gorgeous. I would highly recomend them to anyone. Thank you! <end>  Diamond-Me  Anybody measured the weight of ring? I happened to do so several months later after I got it.

 B000JRM6LK  Three Stone Princess Cut Diamond Ring 1/4ctw in White Gold - Size 5 ||	  Great Ring!  I purchased this as an engagement ring for my girlfriend. The ring arrived very quickly and was very beautiful. It is not a big ring but then again I didn't expect it to be. It is perfect for what I wanted it for. Quality of the ring looks great, no visible problems what-so-ever. I would recommend this ring to anyone looking for a great gift or engagement ring that won't break the bank. <end>  beautiful  I love it! it is really so beautiful.

 B000JSBN5Y  Ivory Color Bone Bangle Bracelet ||	  Versatile and different  I really like wearing this bracelet. I did, somehow, think that I was getting a real bone bracelet, but even so I have enjoyed the bracelet very much. It is comfortable to wear, and it goes with so many outfits. <end>
 B000JSBQ2E  Chunky Beaded Natural Tone Stretch Bracelet ||	  Pretty but flimsy!  When I got this, I loved it. The orange bead really grabbed my eye and I wore it with everything. But it so flimsy. It broke after wearing it twice. I was really disappointed. Normally I dont have a problem with NVIE but this time it was a bummer. <end>
 B000JSFY3Q  Jaipur Copper Metal Cuff Bracelet ||	  This bracelet makes a statement!  I love wide bracelets that stand out and become a conversation piece and this one does! <end>  Love it!  My boyfriend bought this cuff for me, and I love it! It looks just like the picture, and I get a lot of compliments on it! It doesn't tighten, so if you have very small wrists it may not fit. I have small wrists, and it spins on me, but I love how it looks so much that I'm not bothered! <end>  Great value!  Girlfriend loved it! Everyone asked where she got it! Certainly an excellent deal, and just as described! <end>  Jaipur Copper Metal Cuff Bracelet  This bracelet was exactly what I had in mind for a particular dress. It seems that buying a copper bracelet other than the ones which have health claims, isn't all that easy. The price was perfect for my needs. <end>
 B000JTLV5U  Dangle Earrings with Baked Glass Amber Drop Bead ||	  Dangle Earrings  I am happy with this purchase. They are versatile because I can wear them with brown, or black or blue. <end>  not pretty at all  I got these , and they aren't as nice as they are in the pic. They look very cheap . I guess for 2.99 , I got just what I bought ;( <end>
 B000JTMTQU  Yellow Jade Round Leaf Dangle Earrings, 14k Gold ||	  Yellow jade leaf earrings  Exquisite. Well crafted. Have been looking for earrings for 3 years to go with an awesome jade necklace I got as a gift. These are perfect. <end>
 B000JTOWXI  Green Jade Nature Pendant, 14k Gold ||	  Natural Luck  The pendant that I received looks just like the one in the picture. It is very pretty and just what I wanted. I like the one inch size and the color is very vibrant. I looked for the symbol and I think that it means "luck". It arrived just when it was scheduled to and it came in a very pretty little blue box with a silver ribbon on it. Thank you for the nice piece. <end>
 B000JUDPOO  Kooky Bug Pin from the Artazia Collection #613 DCP NP OP ||	  Most unique, beautiful and artsy  I am so impressed with the quality and artwork on both pieces I bought. I received the items in 2 days in lovely boxes. I showed the pieces to friends...they went NUTS! I am going back for more. <end>
 B000JUFK8I  14K White Gold 3/4 ct. Diamond Dangle Earrings ||	  Excellent service but unsatisfied with earrings  Received earrings very quickly in lovely box w/ribbon. However, the earrings themselves are tiny and the stones aren't pretty -- they're milky/cloudy. And although the design looks great online, I did not like it in person -- the top two connected parts are very stiff and then the bottom two connected parts dangle freely. <end>  Good sparkle in candlelight  By daylight these earrings are a little less sparkling in reality than they appear in the picture, but they make up for that during a candlelight dinner. I personally like understated, good quality jewelry that requires a good look, so I am happy, but if you like eyecatching bling this one is not your thing. Katarina in my experience is a very reliable seller. <end>
 B000JVTIP8  Turquoise Blue Cubes Beaded Wire Collar Necklace ||	  Very pretty and good quality  I expected this to look a lot cheaper than it does. It was a great value. <end>
 B000JVVMM0  Silver White Hearts Beaded Long Collar Necklace ||	  Quality product that enhances any outfit.  This product is wonderful. Supplier shipped out quickly and in secure packaging. Came with a lovely cloth bag. Jewlery is well-crafted and have already received compliments. Would definitely recommend! <end>  Looks very cheap  It's the large glass beads that are of very poor quality in this necklace. Too bad, I paid less for another Nvie necklace and I was more satisfied with that one than this one. <end>
 B000JVW3BO  Fuschia Shell Collar Necklace with Crochet Beads ||	  Very cheap looking  I wouldn't reccomend this because it looks so cheap. It's long and not very nice too. <end>
 B000JVXO7Q  Egyptian Medallion Resin Pendant Necklace with Wood Accents ||	  Really big but really interesting!  I'm sure that there is someone out there for whom this large pendant necklace is perfect; but alas, that person just isn't me. I was instantly drawn to this item's low low price, but I didn't realize that this would be really big. To get an idea of how big this pendant is, take a soda can and use it to trace a circle (holding your pen and pencil straight, and not making it angle at the bottom). I think this is still a pretty piece, and I am trying to think of an alternate use for it. Possibly it will go on my Christmas tree with all my other jewelry mishaps. I was thinking of going with the theme "bejewelled." Oh, and also, the adjustable cord is about 18 inches long on one side, 36 inches if you lay it out along the side of a tape measure (as I did). <end>
 B000JVXRNC  Pink Resin and Wood Beaded Collar Necklace ||	  really like it  The beads were a little bulkier than I was expecting, but it actually looks really nice. It's a little longer than a choker and looked really nice with a peach v-neck top. I got several compliments, so I like it even more. <end>
 B000JVY5GU  Oriya Metallic Multistrand Pendant Necklace with Red/Green Glass Beads ||	  Pendent a little too big  The pendent is a little too big for the necklace being so close to your collar. It is kind of cheap construction. You get what you pay for. <end>  Good Bargain  Despite this being only a few dollars, it's very pretty and of good quality. However, the colors of the necklace in real life are actually much darker. <end>
 B000JWDRUY  Triangle Design Dark Bone Bangle Stretch Bracelet ||	  THIS BRACELET ROCKS  THE BEST, I INTEND TO WEAR IT MORE IN THE FALL AND COLDER WEATHER, IT'S KIND OF A HEAVIER TYPE STONEREALLY DIFFERENT.......I LOVE ODD BRACELETS..THANKS <end>
 B000JWFSM4  Dark Green Wide Resin Bangle Bracelet ||	  Greatest Bangle Bracelet I've ever worn  I bought this wide resin bangle bracelet almost 2 years ago. I just loved the way it looked in the picture. The design looks phenomenal, and the size is just right (very wide). This is by far the widest bangle I own, and its hard to find one of its size! It looks great on my wrist. So great in fact, I bought two of them - thankfully I bought the second one before they ran out!I've been wearing the two bangles (one on each hand) nearly 24/7 for almost a year now, and they have been amazing. I occasionally wear rings and necklaces, but only few people ever mentioned them in conversation. However, these bangles make a huge statement! I can't tell you how many times people have said something about these bangles. Even people I don't even know at the mall! They really stand out in an outfit!Another thing which is often overlooked in jewelry is the feel of it. I have worn many silver, and fake-gold bangles for years, however, silver and fake-gold ALWAYS irritate the skin. It doesn't matter if it palladium, or "this is for sensitive skin", or anything. You quickly notice how much a silver, gold, or any metal piece of jewelry irritates the skin with intense itching and what not, especially after the bangle starts peeling its outer coatings. They become hard to wear. However, this bangle doesn't cause any irritation whatsoever! Because it's completely resin, its more or less a piece of plastic or wood on your wrist. You don't notice wearing them at all! I often forget I'm wearing them! Furthermore, because its completely resin, the bangle doesn't fall/peel apart, and water doesn't effect it! Heck, you can wear them in the shower and give them a good wash (I often do). Thus, leading to the saying "you can wear them 24/7". I have for almost a full year now, and have loved every minute of it!Another thing to mention is the sheer durability of them! I have tried wearing bangles for an extended time, but this is the only bangle that really stands up to the test! Knocking them into things causes virtually no damage to them. These things can tank damage to no end! Other bracelets I've owned have cracked, shattered, silver-outlining chips away, etc. But these wide resin bangle bracelets are perfect!On a side note, I started wearing these bangles a year ago after a terrible accident in which I had been feeling miserable for some time before then. But when I put on these bangles, my luck quickly turned! I started feeling a lot more confident, quickly found a job, and now I'm heading to graduate school this September! Heck, I wore them to every Saint Louis Cardinals game I went to last year, and we all know how that ended up! Now the Blues are on a roll! These bangles really bring confidence and luck into your life!All in all, this is by far my favorite item I've ever bought, and I highly suggest it for anyone looking for a wide resin bangle bracelet! <end>
 B000JWGHXI  Sterling Silver Ferret or Mink on Black Onyx Slide Pendant ||	  Wild Eyes  Beautiful work of art! I bought this after my ferret,my best friend passed away. I wear this pendant every day and it has brought some comfort to me. This pendant looked exactly as pictured and I was very pleased with the craftsmanship. This is a must have for any ferret or mink lover. <end>
 B000JWKF5E  Live Love Laugh Laser Etched Italian Charm ||	  Live Love Laugh  I have this on my bracelet. Have given it to both daughters-in-law. Am giving one to my granddaughter on her birthday.good reminder on how to live each day. <end>  crap  it is a very cheap very small charm. mine was scratched and to get it to slide is very annoying. save your money and get something worth it <end>  Love It  This link holds my philosophy of life..... it reminds me to live life, love life, & have laughter in my life. Each link added contains a special meaning. <end>  Very Satisfied  I am very satisfied with these charms. I was so happy to see them on here since the bracelet isn't as popular as it once was. Thanks for sending these so quickly <end>  Pink Hatter  As becoming a Red Hatter this was a item to add on to other items in my Red Hatter collection. <end>  excellent!  I was very pleased with this product and felt like the transaction went very smoothly. Thank you. <end>
 B000JWOKQO  Synthetic Aquamarine Crystal Bracelet ||	  It's Alright  I love having my birthstone with me whether it's earrings or necklaces or rings, and this bracelet just adds on. <end>
 B000JWOKY6  Blue Crystal and Peridot Quartz Bracelet ||	  beautiful for 7 inch wrist  looks as shown, has just the right weight on wrist, great for gift.. too small for me. <end>  Great Colors  Absolutely love the blue and green stones. It coordinates with so many summer outfits. The clasp is a little small and hard to work is the only negative. <end>
 B000JWTXO8  Loving Family Vermeil Pendant - Mother and Three Children ||	  Great Gift  I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Mother's Day. She has given me three beautiful grandchildren. She loved it! <end>  Great Product  I bought this pendant for my mom and she loves it. It has been over a year and its still in very good shape. Good product in all, would recommend it. <end>
 B000JXT6ZI  14K Yellow Gold Blue Agate Cameo Pendant W/ 18" Chain Depicting Mother Holding Child ||	  A Little Better Packaging Would Help  I just got my pendant and it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. However, I'd say that given the bouncing it must take during shipping, a better wrap would be nice. The pendant itself was fine but the chain, which is very very fine, came with a knot...very hard to remove. <end>  Beautiful  Purchaed for my wife's Christmas present. I was concerned that it might be too small, but it is the perfect size. The workmanship is beautiful. She is going to love it!! The chain is rather dainty, but matches the pendant. <end>  Jen W  My husband ordered this for my Christmas gift from our new infant daughter. I absolutely LOVE it!!!! The chain was a little thinner than I would have liked, but you know that when you buy a pendant like this, the chain is not what you are paying for. It is a beautiful piece that I look forward to passing on to my daughter when she has her first child! Shipping was also great. Only took about 2-3 days to come in. LOVE THIS PENDANT... it is absoultely georgeous!! <end>  14K Yellow Gold Blue Agate Mother Holding Child Cameo Pendant W/ 18" Chain  I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. It was an awesome birthday gift.The only thing that could have been more helpful is how thick the chain is.If I would have known how thin it was I would have looked for a little thicker chain.But over all it was the perfect gift. <end>  14K Yellow Gold Blue Agate Mother Holding Child Cameo Pendant W/ 18" Chain  Gift for my mom. She liked it. <end>
 B000JYGJMU  Household Essentials Jewelry Organizer ||	  good. . . but  I bought this jewelry organizer about a year ago and have a couple things I would change. It definitely needs some kind of closure across each line of pockets, maybe a thin strip of velcro. I tried to fold it up to put it in my safe when I was going away and jewelry went everywhere, especially smaller items. Also, it would be very convenient if the hanger swiveled. <end>  Great Product!  I just received my order in the mail yesterday (by the way, the standard shipping came VERY fast!). I am VERY satisfied with the product! It holds everything that I need it to. There is only one thing that I would change about it. I would make the necklace pouches slightly larger, but they are still adequate in size. I definitely suggest getting this if you are like me  Limited Space, Lots of Costume Jewelry, and very organized! <end>  Fantastic Jewelry Organizer  I have owned this product for about 5 years and absolutely love it!!! It is such a great way to organize my jewelry and it's even better that all of it is in the same place. I have given this as gifts to my sisters and several friends and everyone else loves it as much as I do! Great product!! <end>  great product for cheap price!  This was a great solution for many earrings and other jewelry. It took up very little space in my closet and seems like it is sturdy enough that it will last a while. I love that it swivels so, while the holder is hanging in my closet, I can turn the holder to look at both sides. There is really little reason to ever remove it from the closet. My only complaint is that if i take the holder out of my closet and lay it flat, a few of the earrings fall out. I wish there was some sort of closing mechanism for the pockets for those times that I choose to remove the holder from the closet and lay it on the bed. It is a great product for the cheap price!!!!! <end>
 B000JYJ148  Silver Diamond Initial Pendant "N" with Silver Chain ||	  Nice item  The item is realy nice but the size is very smallBut still nice itemThanks <end>  excellent purchase  The necklace was even more beautiful than I expected.Service was great.I would purchased for this seller agin.........Terry <end>
 B000JZ2Z8G  Southwestern Style Bear with Heartline and Bear Paw Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise and Lapis Chip Inlay for Men or Women, Size 8, #10518 ||	  SOUTHWESTERN STYLE BEAR WITH HEARTLINE  THE RING IN THE PICTURE IS THE RING THAT I ORDERED BUT IT IS NOT THE RING I RECEIVED. THE ONE IN THE PICTURE HAS A TURQUOISE BEAR ON IT WITH A SILVER HEARTLINE THROUGH IT. THE ONE I RECEIVED HAS AN INSET BEAR WTIH BLACK BACKGROUND AND A BEAR PAW ON IT. <end>

 B000JZ8J3G  Southwestern Style Three Dimensional Lizard Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise Chip Inlay for Men or Women, size 8, #10992 ||	  Love it!  Very beautiful. I bought it for my boyfriend and he wears it every day. Wonderful quality. <end>
 B000K1G9G8  14k Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  The size of earings is not same!!!!!  I buy a gift to my girl friend, but she finds that the size of earings is not the same, one is bigger than the other one. I am so angry about this, this is for valentina`s day <end>  A little disappointed, but ok!  I bought them for my grandma's birthday. I received them in 3days. However, I noticed a pretty big black speck in one of the diamond stud. The other one is beautiful and sparkly. I was a little disappointed, but I know my grandma wouldn't mind it too much... <end>  Small and pretty  These earrings are very small, maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each. They do appear white, (I don't see any yellow tinting) with a slight, slight bit of grey, which I prefer over a super white look (as you might sometimes find in a cz). These earrings catch the light nicely, showing a bit of rainbow effect. They aren't super, super sparkly or faceted, but they do possess shine and detail. I am very happy with these earrings as they are just what I wanted  something petite and real, set in yellow gold, and with a nice, clean and "believably" sparkly look! I also like the fit of the earrings backs, very tight and secure. <end>  Great for Day-to-Day Use  I bought these for my wife, and she really likes them. They're small enough that she can wear them day-to-day, but they're nice enough for formal occasions as well. This is a very versatile set of earrings at a great price. <end>  Not Clear  14k White Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I-2 Clarity)I was reluctant to purchase these earings after reading other reviews,but bought them anyway for a 31st anniversary gift for my wife.Although she wanted to be grateful,I could tell she was disappointed.We are not experts on diamonds, but these were dull and had no sparkle at all.I had purchased a similar pair a while back from Wal-Mart (she lost one)and they had better stones and nicer crowns.Shop before you buy these earings. <end>  Unbelievable  I couldn't belive my eyes when I saw diamond earrings with such an affordable price! I definitely think that selecting white gold is the way to go because it won't distract from the mesmerizing glamour of the diamonds. All my friends were wowed and shared that they will also consdier buying a pair. I am so happy. <end>  Good price, diamonds not so good  Within a few months of wearing the earrings I noticed a black speck in the center of one diamond. I took it to my jeweler to have it cleaned and was told that the speck was an inclusion. The inclusion became visible because the layer that covered it had shattered. The black speck is still there. It completely ruined the pair of earrings for me. <end>  I sent them back.  Having read the other reviews I expected something small, but decent. The particular pair I received had two defects  1. one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2. one of the stones had a very large, visible black inclusion near the top. It was visible to my naked eye (I don't have a jeweler's loupe) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but given those two problems and the small size of the stones, I sent them back and did not try again. <end>  They are what they say they are  A good value for what it is. My only complaint is that these earrings are tiny - the picture can be deceiving that way, and the label 1/4 carot helps in that deception because that is the combined size (each being only 1/8 carot) yet sounds "big" (not as bad though as rings that claim 1 carot but are really 100 stones of what I call diamond dust, combined to add up to 1 carot). <end>  Buyer be ware!!  I ordered these earrings when they were on sale for $99.00 because I thought they were an excellent deal. After they arrived and I put them on, my fiance noticed (from 6 feet away) that one of the studs had a large black spot right in the middle. I will be sending them back tomorrow. <end>  Diamond eearings  The diamonds were very small and clarity was horrible. They were not clear at all. We sent them back and went to a local jeweler to purchase. <end>  Srong Quality for Price  Purchased this for wife. I was somewhat concerned given some previous reviews that the quality of the diamond would be weak, which is somewhat expected given the price. However, I was was pleasantly surprised that they seemed like very good quality diamonds, and my wife was impressed. <end>  Beautiful  I chose the yellow gold instead of the white gold earrings, and I have to say they are amazing. The look and design is beautiful. The diamonds themselves were small, but for being 1/8 of a carrot, that's to be expected. But if the recipient has smaller ear lobes (like mine did), that won't matter one bit. Delivery was also really quick. <end>  Best purchase I've made!  I actually bought 2 different pair of diamond ear rings. The 14k gold ones were the keepers! They are pretty and big enough to use as a second pair in my ears! Thanks to Amazon for this offering! <end>  tiny  much smaller than appear... it may have been a lack of attention payed to the cttw, but it may also have been that the total weight was the two together and not each one separately. <end>  sweet & petite  I ordered a smaller size for a piercing on top of ear on curve and they are perfect for the spot. Good shine and clarity for the price. Thanks <end>  Too small earings  UPSET!! ......Was an unpleasant surprise when I opened the box and see it. because in the photo the earrings look of a perfect size but they are minimal, too small like for a newborn'http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4BZMS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title <end>  Too small  These are extremely small, bought them as a xmas gift for my bf, he does not seem to mind them so................ But if they were for me, I would not have been satisfied. <end>  Tiny  These are a joke. They are barely big enough to see and look more like a gag gift than real. <end>  My wife loved them!  The earrings are a lot smaller than what I expected but the most important thing is that my wife truly loved them. <end>  A great bargin.  These are simply a wonder pair of earings. What a bargin.I would highly recommend them. <end>  Flawless  Ok so they were not flawless but they were very bright and larger than I expected. I'm not an expert in diamonds but I know a little bit. The color and cut for the money was great. I bought this pair so I could remove one of the diamonds and replace a stone lost out of my girlfriends ring that I bought her last year. The jeweler wanted over $300.00 just for the stone. I said no way!!! This Diamond was a little larger than I expected or needed but the jeweler was able to fit it in the ring for pretty cheap since I bought the stone. The ring now looks great and I have an extra diamond post to give to someone - sometime. <end>  perfect studs  I loved these earrings. My daughter wanted some diamond earrings she could wear everyday to work and these were just the right size for that. Very pleased with these. <end>  good value  This diamond earrings are good value when it is on sale. Quality meet the specification. <end>  better off getting fakes  It's not that I'd expect a whole lot from a $99 dollar pair of diamond studs. But honestly, these are sooooo small about 2mm or less each that you can't tell it's diamond at all. They kind of look like metal posts. There's no room for it to even sparkle. After buying these, I went to Macy's and picked up a fake pair of studs that were bigger and they look a lot more like real diamonds than these. You'd do better to save up and get bigger diamonds or just buy the fakes! <end>  Quality Varies Widely!!!  I ordered these as a gift. Purchased a similar pair for myself, recently and was pleased with quality, but this pair had problems. Had to reorder TWICE (thank you Amazon!), but FINALLY got an acceptable pair, just in time. I disagree with the I1-I2 rating these have. I have purchased diamonds before and knew these were not "top quality", but the ones I received seemed far below any I1-I2 rated diamonds I've bought in the past. It seemed to always be a problem with one earring. Perhaps, Amazon could make sure these were better matched, as a pair. Also, these had noticeable scratches and divots on the face or table, which is the most visible part on a solitaire diamond. $100 is a lot of money for lesser quality diamonds. Setting and backs were fine. In the end, all is well; but I'm not sure I would order these again. <end>  For under $100 -a fabulous find  For the price these earrings are a GREAT buy. The ones I received are quite clear, and refract light beautifully. Maybe I got lucky, but for $100 diamonds I couldn't ask for more! <end>  looks pretty...  I think the earrings look good. They were smaller than I anticipated. I don't buy jewelry a lot. A close up picture next to something of known size would have helped me visualize how big the earrings were. For $99 it's a deal for me! <end>  Returned based on quality of product  I had decided to order this set of diamond stud earrings as a gift for my girlfriend in spite of reading a few reviews with negative comments. I knew that they would be small, which was okay because I thought they would be nice for everyday use, and my problem was not with the size but the quality of the diamonds. One earring had a small black spot along the outer edge of its diamond and the other earring had two large and easily visible white cloudy areas inside of its diamond. These defects were visible to the naked eye and I decided it was not worth the risk of any disappointment as a gift and so I returned them. I would not recommend the earrings as a gift but perhaps they are okay for personal use. They were quite sparkly despite their interior flaws. <end>  Great Size for Everyday  A lovely pair of diamond earring studs! I received them as a birthday gift from my parents.. Both earrings are the same size.. Nice cut - sparkle nicely in the light.. Cannot see any flaws with the naked eye.. Perfect size earring for everyday use. I wear them in my second ear piercing.. The backs stay on tightly. I leave them on all the time.Honestly I think this pair I got from Amazon is comparable to more expensive ones I've had from jewelry stores. <end>  diamond stud earrings  looks good and mounted good. makes a great gift for the lady in your life <end>  cute earings  I bought these earings as a gift for my sister and she loved them.I had paid $99 for the pair which is a great price, but I do wish they were a bit bigger. That is why I gave them 4 stars. Other than that they are great. <end>
 B000K2H1L4  14k Gold, Round-Cut, Diamond Studs (1/3 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Nice For Everyday  I found this pair of studs to be nice for everyday wear. They look much better than the ones found in Macy's fine jewelry and they cost less. Personally I would not go over 1/3 ctw with this quality because the flaws would become obvious. I am very satisfied with my purchase. <end>  Was unsure at first..  I bought these for my girlfriend during the sale and the price was GREAT. I was unsure about purchasing at first after reading the other reviews but I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. They came in a navy blue box (the kind you get at stores)- not a bag. With the naked eye these look great and sparkle wonderfully. Initially one looked a little dull but it was just dirty (odd) but I wiped it with my shirt (high tech, you know) and it cleaned right off to a brilliant sparkle. The backings worked just fine they weren't too loose. I think Amazon has stepped up their game in this department. 1/3 cttw looks healthy and is not too small or obnoxiously large on her ears. They're great for everyday use and priced right. You don't need to buy high clarity diamonds in this size (I1-I2/I-J is perfect) and no one will be able to tell the difference without a examining them professionally. These were nearly half the price and larger than previously purchased store earrings and I'm completely satisfied. <end>  Nice and simple  I got these knowing that I was not spending very much money on them. That being said, they look very nice. I think that they look like good diamond earrings. I am very happy with them. <end>  What's that black spot?  Now I'm no jeweler, but I have bought my partner a few diamonds over time. And I know a little about the C's of a diamond. And if I am reading correctly your not supposed to be able to see imperfections in these without magnification. There is a spot in one of the ones that ordered that can be see while wearing them. I think the ratings on these are skewed a little. Not as high quality as they are listed to be. <end>  Good but not great.  The quality of these studs is good but not great. Feathers are visible in the diamonds when lighted from the side. Under normal light the diamonds appear reasonably bright and clear. My wife is happy with them. <end>  Color not what I expected  I was extremely disappointed in the color of the diamonds. There was a very distinct yellow color, not the "near colorless" I expected from an I-J diamond. As mentioned in other reviews, they are pretty lackluster. The good part is that they were very inexpensive so I didn't waste too much money. I guess you get what you pay for. <end>  Not what I was expecting  I received a few great buys from Amazon on jewelry, but these earrings didn't measure up to what I was expecting. The best way to describe the earrings I received is that they are dull. There is no glimmer in them whatsoever. Being fairly inexpensive, I thought they'd at least have a little life in them, but they don't. I'd have been better off with CZs. <end>  Backings are a liability  These are typical size for the prize. They're not bad looking. My main problem are the backings. These were a small gift for my girlfriend. I had read reviews from 1 year ago warning about the backings. I thought Amazon must have fixed the problem based on the reviews. Then my girlfriend almost lost both of the earrings. After only a week of use, she actually had both earrings in her ears without the backings, because the backings had fallen off at some point. She was lucky she didn't lose them. After that she switched to a different backing and it hasn't happened again. <end>  Diamond earrings  I received an email with diamond stud earrings 30% off. I had already decided to buy some that I had seen at Sam's Club but were 1/4 ct. I bought a better and bigger diamond earring and paid the same price that they were asking at sam's for the smaller diamond. They are great. <end>  Nice! (SEE UPDATE!)  Nice little earrings! Look smaller than what's in the picture, but that was what I expected. Diamonds look VERY NICE for size and grade. Were a little dirty, but easily cleaned. Setting is a little smaller and more delicate than I expected, but acceptable. Would have liked a different way of packaging, not blue bag. Earrings were stuck one through the loop of the others clasp, then in bag, which slightly bent and scratched post and clasp, but you can't tell when wearing. Clasps don't fit real tight, possibly because of being slightly bent due to method of packaging. Easily fixed, but annoying. I bought these on a good promotional deal for $162, very good price; don't think I would have been quite as happy, if I paid full price of $270. Nice everyday earrings! UPDATE  Purchased another pair in June 2009-QUALITY OF STONES WAS TERRIBLE!!! Filled with many BIG, black inclusions, fissures and flaws. Stones looked dull, dark, gray, had no sparkle at all. Couldn't possibly be I1-I2. Returned for a refund. Would not buy again! Very bad! <end>  wifes happy  purchased for my wife for x-mas. she realy likes them, the only problem was that the clasps were to loose so she piked up new ones so a earring would not get lost. they are very sparkely and not to gaudy.great budget buye. <end>  Very pleased with my purchase!  Was a little hesitant about ordering earrings online, especially diamonds. However, I am so very pleased with these. Just the right size for the second piercing in my earlobe. The setting is beautiful! They came with a diamond guarantee. <end>  Good buy  I wanted a pair of earrings that were not super tiny but not huge. This was a great compromise. They were a fair price and I like them. Have not taken them out since I got them for my first mothers day! ) Would recommend them. Color and clarity were good. <end>  Nice product for the price  Only wish they had locking backs hate to lose one because it slid off the post. Other wise it was a gift that was appreciated. <end>  Great everyday diamonds!  I was looking for smallish diamond studs to wear every day in my upper holes, so I could wear other bigger earrings below. These are perfect for that. They are extremely comfortable, sparkle beautifully, and have not caused any irritation  I put them in a week ago, and just left them in. No problems. I certainly would recommend these. They are big enough to show they are diamonds, and not so big as to look like zirconias. <end>  Pretty little diamonds  I bought these for my daughter to replace a pair she had lost. The price was good and the earrings are beautiful on her ears. <end>  Diamond earrings  I bought these earrings as a present for my mothers birthday. They arrived in NZ four days after ordering, I was most impressed with the speedy service. The earrings themselves were lovely and most importantly my mother loved them. Thanks Amazon <end>  She liked them  These looked good on my gal's ears and appeared more expensive than they were. Good deal, good quality. Recommended. <end>  Not recommend to buy  1.The errings looks good. the stone is shining.2.However, the pierce can't be fixed well on the ear, and may fall or lost the earring. Can't used in for about one month. <end>  diamonds  She loved them but they were smaller than they looked in picture and the backings were not the best she used some older backing and they look nice. spend more and buy better <end>  Bad buy, treated diamonds??? I2 or worse?  These diamonds are at the bottom of the barrel as far as quality, clarity, cut and so on. Enter the statement may have been treated and they are a bad buy all around. I would feel terrible knowing I bought a diamond that may fall apart on my girlfriend when she cleans them, or if they lose their sparkle due to any coatings, laser drillings that may fall out over time. Do your homework and buy a book "How to buy a diamond". You will not regret what you learn about your next purchase on a quality diamond. Insist on non treated stones. They are a worthwhile investment for you or your loved one. <end>  Nice  They arived today, nice size not too big or tiny, the white gold setting makes it more distinguish. Good purchase <end>  Worst purchase I made from Amazon  I feel as if I've been burned for the first time by Amazon.Should have a "no star" choice for these.These earrings broke when I removed the made in the USA tag.They are so small that you can barely see them. I just threwaway 220.00. Thanks, Amazon. Won't be buying anything butbooks from you from now on. And, I could not cancel the ordereven an hour after placing the order; that should have toldme something.14k White Gold Round Diamond Stud Earrings (1/3 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I-2 Clarity) <end>
 B000K2INA2  10k Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Studs (1/3 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Stef's Review  My earrings were defective. The metal is thin and one of the diamonds had a HUGE scratch down the middle. I sent them back for a refund. Amazon was great about refunding my money. <end>  its small.........  It was my mistake to not read the dimensions on earrings. They are extremely small i dont even know if i am going to give it to my wife. One the dimounds is not fine cut it has no pattern looks shattered and the other one looks fine cut equailly cut in porportion. You get what you get for low price............ <end>  You get what you pay for...  I ordered these for my Girlfriend. They stones BOTH had large defects (I'm no expert in diamonds, so I dunno what it's really called). By defects I mean both stones had HUGE black flecks in them. At least they were symmetrical.  / Anyways....other than that...they were great....at least I didn't make this mistake with an engagement ring. <end>  Review  I was somewhat disappointed in that one of the studs did not have an anchor back to hold it. Other than that they were above average for the cost. <end>  Amazing Diamond Jewlery  My wife was thrilled and shocked with these diamond earrings. Color, Cut, Clarity and Brilliance is remarkable and they are beautiful. Fantastic product and company. <end>  diamond earring  I bought 3 pairs one for each of my three daughters for Christmas and they loved them. I was very pleased. <end>  More like "bling" and not "BLING"  The earrings took a awhile to arrive; when it did, it was packaged well. I thought the tw 1/3 would be a little bigger however, it is a nice "bling" for the price. <end>  Wrong size  I would like to warn everyone who purchases this item to measure them when you get it!I probably would not have been able to tell the difference if this was not a replacement set for a lost earring... but they sent me a 1/10 carat when it should have been this (1/3 carrot) I did some research when I opened it and found the dimensions it should have been and it was exactly .10 X .10 inches and 3mm X 3mm for you metric folk.BUYER BEWARE! <end>
 B000K2K4GS  14k Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Studs (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Understated beauty  I bought these as a Christmas present for my wife years ago when I was on an even more stringent budget than I am now. I did a lot of comparison shopping, and these are certainly a great value for the size, cut, clarity and color of the diamonds. She still loves these now and was thrilled I was able to afford a pair of real diamond earrings during those days. A few things to consider 1. They are relatively small. These are not huge, splashy stones, but pretty and understated. This is for someone who values quality over quantity.2. I have not seen any of the durability or looseness problems stated in other reviews. My wife has worn them on a fairly regular basis over the years and have not had any issues.3. If you're a novice diamond buyer like I was, make sure to read up on the 4 C's of diamonds  Cut, Color, Clarity and Carat. <end>  nice but easy to loose  I got them for Our anniversary. I love them because they are small and cute, but I am almost afraid to wear them because the stud is too thin and the stopper is too big. <end>  Great Christmas gift  The earrings I bought from Amazon were absolutely great! They arrived about a week before Christmas and, with some clever wrapping, my fiance was extremely pleased. I highly recommend them! <end>  Small but lovely  Yes, they are very small and even though the pictures show them enlarged they are still very beautiful. I received these as a Christmas present last year from my Mother-in-law and am still in love with them. Though petite, I get many compliments on them. These earrings are something I will always treasure for the rest of my life. <end>  Too small  and very cheap looking and diamond were not that clear. I was disappointed and had to return the item. i would not suggest this. <end>  home maker  these are gorgeous and seem like good quality i wanted something speial for me and the worked nicley. i will enjoy wearing them <end>  They should update the clasp  The order came very quickly and the diamonds were as advertised, but one of the clasps was broken. The clasps in general seem somewhat unreliable. <end>  not bad  i bought these earrings for my girlfriend's birthday. the earrings were much smaller than i expected. i didnt know how small a quarter carat was i guess. anyways, she smiled when she saw them (i know what she was thinking...) and said she loved them - her first pair of diamond earrings. the earrings look much better on ears than they do in the box. overall, i am satisfied with the earrings for the amount i paid (~$100) <end>  NOT WORTH IT!!  These earrings were a dissapointment. They were very dull and so tiny that for the price it's not worth it at all. <end>  Great quality, great price!  I purchased these for my wife's birthday. She absolutely loved them. I don't know if she has taken them out and that was nearly two weeks ago! While I've address the sanitary consequences of this with her, she insists she loves them and doesn't want to take them out. I highly recommend the 14k White Gold, Princess-Cut, Diamond Stud Earrings for the girl that wears modest jewelry. She will love these. <end>
 B000K2M96G  14k Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Studs (1/2 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Just what I wanted  These earrings are just as described. Very beautiful! Note  Does not come with any certificate or appraisal. <end>  I love them !!  My husband bought me these earrings this year for Christmas. They are absolutely beautiful! The clarity is excellent and I love wearing them!! <end>  Exactly what was wanted!  I received these earrings as a post wedding gift after wanting a pair of 1/2 carat studs for quite some time. These were exactly as described and look great! <end>  No Certificate!!  Where is the certificate? I am not very happy with my purchase here. For $500 I would expect a nicer box and a certificate. Overall the diamonds do look nice. <end>  mismatched stones  I rely heavily on customer reviews when making a purchase and I normally don't create my own review unless I have something add that others missed or if I had a different experience from the common trends. I thought I knew what I was getting from this purchase but I was wrong.First, the stones did not match! One was a brilliant, near colorless gem. I was actually very surprised how nice it looked even though I had ordered an I-J color diamond. The second, not so nice. It was clearly yellow and not even a close match. It makes you wonder how someone could even pair the two together it was that obvious. If that wasn't bad enough, upon closer inspection you could see that the cut/design did not match either. The pattern was again, clearly different. To top it all off, we had to take a pressure backing from another earring and use it on this pair since the one that came with the diamonds did not have enough friction to hold on to the stud! This could have been a disaster considering that the reason I bought these was to replace the other stud that my wife lost due to a poor backing.I give this a two star rating because the first diamond exceeded my expectations for color and clarity. This makes me hopeful that their can be someone out there that will be the happy recipient of a stunning pair of diamond studs.All in all, my experience was horrible. I've never had any issues with items from Amazon and don't think I will in the future, however, this is probably my first and last jewelry purchase from Amazon. <end>  loose back  I bought these for my wife for Valentine's day. I gave them to her in the morning and she wore them to work. One of the backs came off (and is now lost) and she nearly lost one of the earrings before lunch of the same day. <end>  1/2 ct diamond earrings  The stones were nice and sparkly but the stems were both bent up upon arival. I did the best I could to straighten them but they still don't look right. Overall just glad the wife liked them. <end>  Girlfriend loves them  I got these for my girlfriend on Valentine's day. I don't know that much about jewelry but she really seemed to love them, so this is a 5 star purchase for me  ) <end>  Low quality setting  I ordered these for my girlfriend and after only a week the back fell off and she almost lost one of the diamonds. At this point the backs will not even stay on the earings, so they are un-wearable until I take them to a jeweler and have them re-set. Not Happy at all. <end>
 B000K2MCFE  IGI Certified 10k Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (1 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Not worth it.  I had to return them. The diamonds were too included. They looked like they were peppered. I ended up spending more money on a different pair, but it was worth it in the end. <end>  nice pair of earings  bought this as a gift. the recipient was exhilarated (of course). nice, good size diamonds. came with certification. BUT the gold prongs/stud make the diamond looks smaller and diminish its clarity and luster. if you contemplate purchase of this one, i would suggest a platinum prong/stud instead (i purchased both for two different person and the difference is enormous). <end>  Great  Didn't sparkle quite as much as I had hoped, but still a great set of earrings for the price. No visible inclusions, even up close. The IGI certification estimates the replacement value (for insurance purposes) at more than triple the price paid, and reports 1.06 cttw. I was prepared to be disappointed when they arrived and have to return them, but instead was pleasantly surprised. <end>  Great diamond earrings for the price.  Based on an earlier review I was reluctant to place an order because if it states IJK Color and I2-I3 Clarity I expect to receive K Color, I 3 Clarity and diamonds that total less than 1 cttw. However, with this purchase I was greatly surprised. The earrings I received were H-I Color, I 2 Clarity and 1.08 cttw. I could not be happier. The IGI certificate appraised them at $2,035, although I know they would never sell for that much. They were a great deal for the price. If you order them and are disappointed, you can always return them. <end>  Sadly disappointed.  I looked long and hard for the perfect pair of diamond stud earrings for purchase for a Christmas gift. I searched through online catalogs, local jewelry stores, department stores, even warehouse stores to try to find the perfect pair. The one thing I kept seeing in jewelry stores is that you could get a very nice pair of diamond earrings, and not worry too much about the quality, since all of them looked very nice and sparkling and shiny. Most of the diamond qualities I saw for around $1500 were ~1 ct. total weight, and I2 quality.Then I found these earrings. I had high hopes for them. The price was right, the quality appeared to be the same size and I2 quality that I had seen in all the local jewelry stores. So I purchased them at a fraction of the cost that I would have paid locally, rationalizing to myself that the only difference was the local support (local stores promised replacement of stones that had come loose from fixtures, regular cleanings, etc.).But upon receiving these, I was instantly disappointed. The shipping was right on time, and Amazons service could not have been better, but the diamonds were a mess. I received I3 quality diamonds that looked dull and cloudy. One of the stones even looked shattered as if the diamond had cracked. It made the stones look less like brilliant diamonds and more like cheap glass. The settings on the earrings were good quality, but the diamond quality (or lack thereof) just killed the appearance of the earrings.I send them back to amazon the day after Christmas. Amazon processed the return quickly and even reimbursed my shipping costs for sending them back. Their service and support couldn't have been better on this purchase, but the quality of the diamonds just wasn't up to par with what I was expecting.Maybe it was my fault for being a little too cheap, but maybe these are discounted so cheap for a reason. So buy at your own risk, but do buy something from Amazon, they couldn't be better at what they do! <end>  Wonderful  The Diamonds were as promised. The quality was superb. My wife was very pleased with them as I had hoped. <end>  Great Value!  Bought this earring set as a birthday gift for the significant other. I was indeed impressed with the clarity and quality for the price. No, these earrings are not "engagement ring" quality, but the price is hard to ignore for what you are getting.I was surprised to see how clear and white the stones were. The I2 pair we received did not show any visible inclusions (to my untrained naked eye at least). Further, the sparkle was far more than what I expected for a set at this price point. While the description lists a J-K color range, my pair actually was certified as an I color. Not a huge difference, but a welcome surprise nonetheless.In my personal opinion, a higher color grade and clarity grade are important considerations for a high-profile diamond, such as in an engagement ring. Save your money if you are considering a higher color or clarity grade for earrings, as no one will notice, nor care. This set will sparkle and look just as great on her ear as a set double in price. <end>  Meh.... Look elsewhere.  Received I3 K colored earrings. They are so included that you can tell from 4 feet away. The inclusions make them look fractured in the middle. Very low on sparkle... So, great price, but perhaps look elsewhere. <end>
 B000K2O0LS  10k Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs (3/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Not what I expected  The diamonds were quite yellow, so much that I debated whether to give them to my wife, and she visibly debated taking them. I don't think I'll buy jewelry from Amazon again, just because I have no way to see what I'm getting until the day it arrives. <end>  3/4 cttw diamond stud earrings  Great price, great quality. They made me a hero with my wife, even if it was only for a day. Does any husband get more credit than one day? <end>  10k White Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (3/4 cttw, IJK Color, I2-I3 Clarity)  I received exactly what was described! Thank you! <end>  not impressive...  size was ok (but on the smaller size which is expected). However the clarity and color were terrible. I returned the earrings and will be spending more from now on. <end>  Not worth the price  First set came in with a diamond loose, so you know the setting isn't that great. Second set came with much lower quality stones than the first. Returned for refund, and went elswhere. For about $40 more I was able to pick up much better quality and clarity. I can not say enough good things about the customer service at Amazon on this item though. Not one commment or critque of my taste or of my decision. I would shop Amazon again but look for higher quality. <end>  large carbon spot on one earring, perfect on the other  One of the earrings had a very large carbon spot just under the surface of the top of the stone. Visible from 20 feet away on a 3/8 of a carrot stud. <end>  Diamonds more yellow than I thought  I read the previous reviews and was told that the earrings might have a slight coloring to them. When I received them they were quite yellow. Size was ok. Decided to keep them and use in my third hole in ear. ill order other earring with better color and clarity <end>  she loves them  She loves then and thats all that really matters. they look good. and i was the hero. <end>  ; )  transaction was easy and smooth, delivered before expected time, and product was in good condition. <end>
 B000K36D5S  Princess Cut 1.50 carat Amethyst Ring Size 9 in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  unhappy  I purchased this as a gift a month before giving it to the person. It was too big for wife's fingers. Contacted merchant, but they said it was past return period. Will not buy from again. Gave two stars because it was as described. <end>
 B000K38BCQ  Oval Shape 1.50 carat Garnet Ring Size 12 in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful Ring  I wish Peora would have like most of the other ring sellers and have you choose a size instead of just Size 12...I bought this ring for the size since I don't want to wear rings on my ring finger and am not a thumb person.So I bought this ring and another thinking at least they will fit.They fit well and look amazing.The silver is .952 sterling silver.The Garnet (January birthstone) is stunning.Even if the garnet is fake (which I doubt) it is still an awesome ring.Very happy. <end>
 B000K3A6H4  Radiant Cut 2.50 carat Swiss Blue Topaz Ring Size 13 in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Love this ring  I love the stone on this ring. The silver detail is a little scrappy but it looks great if you don't hold it a foot from your face! This was perfect for what I wanted and great value. It was shipped straight away and arrived in a cute little box. I also bought a necklace to match and both look lovely on. <end>  Luv it!!!  I always have problems to find rings my size. On the computer it looked a lot darker that I receiced. I was expecting a dark blue topaz and it was a light topaz. Nonetheless, as soon as I put it on, it fit perfectly. The fit is perfect, it feels very comfortable, as if you are not even wearing a ring. The filigree on each side of the ring makes it look like it was diamonds until someone looks carefully. I keep getting comments on how beautiful it is. Luv it and I would purchase another one in a different color soon. Very happy with it and thank you. <end>
 B000K3A6KQ  Oval Shape 2.00 carat Peridot Ring Size 11 in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  FANTASTIC!  The ring is very beautiful and the gem shines like none other I've ever seen. Incredible price and service. I'll be shopping from this online retailer again and again! <end>
 B000K3C6SQ  Oval Shape 1.50 carat Swiss Blue Topaz Ring Size 12 in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful Ring  I wish Peora would have like most of the other ring sellers and have you choose a size instead of just Size 12...I bought this ring for the size since I don't want to wear rings on my ring finger and am not a thumb person.So I bought this ring and another thinking at least they will fit.They fit well and look amazing.The silver is .952 sterling silver.The Swiss Topaz (December birthstone) is stunning.Even if the topaz is fake (which I doubt) it is still an awesome ring.Very happy. <end>
 B000K3VWFE  Sita's Choice Wood Beaded Collar Necklace ||	  ok  This is a nicely made piece I was just hoping for something not soo long, more like a choker . <end>
 B000K41OW4  Orange Beaded Resin Pendant Necklace with Brass Beads ||	  Nice!!!  I was unsure about this product, after receiving it. The big orange balls look like small Christmas ornaments and some of the other balls look like some ancient old ladyish stuff. Lucky for me, I know how to make the ugliest piece of garment or accessory work and look good so...that is why I still rate this necklace with four stars. <end>
 B000K41P0A  Chloe's Choice Turquoise Blue Resin Beaded Collar Necklace ||	  LOOKS BETTER THAN PICTURE  This is a gorgeous piece. I love turqoise soooooooo much and the necklace will ideally suit the fashionista. Looks better than expected. I thought that it would be small but it is large and stands out. <end>
 B000K41P1E  Earth Tone Potli Beaded Collar Necklace ||	  strange necklace  some of the beads are covered with this strange burlap material that is very ugly! The rest of the necklace is pretty.. <end>
 B000K6BDFK  Sterling Silver First Kiss Heart ID Bracelet 7" ||	  Junk  Brought it to a jewelry store to get engraved and they wouldn't even do it because they said it was just a silver laminate and it would peel. It was supposed to be worth $100 and the jeweler told me it was worth less than $20. I would not reccamend the Neteya Corp. The only good thing I have to say about them is that they refunded my money quickly and easily. <end>
 B000K6CZMA  18K White Gold Box Link Necklace 24" ||	  Beautiful Chain.  Beautiful chain, I had to send mine back because it took so long to get to me that my boyfriend bought me another one. well worth the money, and yes I would have kept it if I could have gotten away with it. <end>
 B000K6CZR0  Sterling Silver Flat Marine rBracelet 8" ||	  great for teenage boy  got this for my 16 year old son - it is a great value if you also get the percent off which is offered from time to time. silver can be soo expensive and he's not too easy on his jewelry. <end>
 B000K6MV2E  Journey of Life Necklace - Inspirational Necklace ||	  Graduation gift  I was looking for a high school graduation gift for our neighbor's daughter that expressed the meaning of this important event in her life, but wasn't overly expensive.This necklace was everything I had been looking for. The piece is simple and appealing to a young woman & the enclosed message says it perfectly.I felt good about the gift and the recipient loved it. <end>  graduation gift  This was purchased as a graduation gift basket insert. It came with a"journey of life" poem which added alot of meaning. Overall very pleased with the product and prompt receipt. <end>  Journey of Life Necklace  Great gift for a graduate who is headed into the world. Won't break the bank. <end>  Disappointed  The concept to the necklace was really nice. The poem in it is cute. But the necklace looks cheap. I could have gotten that same necklace from a street vendor for half the price. The cord is way too short and it's way overpriced. I was disappointed totally! <end>  Pretty. Poor fit for anyone over 12 years old.  I bought these for High school/College graduates. Unfortunately, the cord length for the necklace is rather short. Both girls loved the necklace, the idea behind it, but had to put the pendant on another chain/cord. <end>
 B000K6TG8G  Olive Jade, pearl and Sterling Silver earrings ||	  Beautiful!  These earrings are absolutely beautiful! All of the items I've ordered from Milagro are excellent and I highly recommend them. My only problem with these earrings are that they were two fairly different colors, but once in your ears you really can't tell. <end>
 B000K6TKFU  Naruto Konoha Leaf Symbol Anime Cosplay Bracelet GE7858 ||	  Favorite bracelet  This bracelet is very shiny, lightweight, and can be worn with anything. I was expecting a small bracelet in which I would have to buy an extender for it, but it fits my wrist perfectly. Perfect for the Naruto fangirl or fan of the series itself. <end>  Pretty Sweet.  I like this bracelet. It was for my girlfriend and I think it looks hot. I would not buy it for myself like I accidentally did, because it looks like it was made for girls. (which is why I gave it to my GF) <end>
 B000K7CV50  14k White Gold Moissanite Solitaire Ring (2 cttw equivalent), Size 5 ||	  A brief comment  I've found Moissanite indistinguishable from diamond in day-to-day wearing. I've researched diamond simulants and substitutes extensively over the last several months, and I don't believe the websites that claim that it chips easily and they had to sell diamonds to clients to replace them, as Moissanite's hardness is actually greater than sapphire at 9.25. Also, they claim that it has a greenish cast, but that's incorrect, too, from what I've seen. Maybe the early ones did, but the one I bought doesn't. It has more of a grayish cast, which is what actual diamonds have too. Moissanite does exhibit double refraction, but that's only visible under a microscope, no one can tell with it on your finger. The diamond vested interests must be really worried about Moissanite to resort to the sort of misinformation I saw, and for good reason. The price is one-tenth of what you'd pay for a two-carat diamond, and you can put the savings in the bank or invest it, which would be the smart thing to do, especially for a young couple.The diamond websites also claim that it's hard to find Moissanite with excellent clarity and lack of inclusions compared to the best diamonds, but still, even if true, you can't tell except under much higher magnification. Even an average quality 2 carat diamond is going to run around $12,000, but my Moissanite was only about $1400 even after taxes. The diamond websites I saw like to give you the impression that there's something wrong with Moissanite, but there's nothing wrong with having a ruby or sapphire or emerald, and as I said, Moissanite is actually slightly harder than sapphire at 9.25, and substantially harder than emerald, which is softer than sapphire at about 8.5. So really, it's like having a clear sapphire, but even harder, in terms of hardness and durability.Moissanite does have slightly higher light dispersion and refraction than diamond, but that just makes it look a bit more sparkly. It's not as dramatic a difference as cubic zirconia, which has much higher dispersion than diamond, and now I can tell the difference with cubic zirconia and diamond without much problem. But I don't think anyone but an expert, and maybe not even them, could tell with it just on your finger. I think they'd have to resort to the specialized tests. So overall, it's a great substitute for diamond that can save you many thousands of dollars, and I've been very happy with mine. <end>  Beautiful, sophisticated, distinctive and perfect  One of the most beautiful moissanite rings. The stone is beautiful and sparkles like it's on fire. Also, the shank is very modern and simple. The ring looks designer. <end>  We like Moissanite  I've been buying Moissanite for a few years now. My girlfriend is very happy with the pendants and earrings I've gotten her. No problems with chips but she is not hard on her jewelry. We feel that it has a bit more color sparkle than a real diamond. We really like that. We don't like cubic zircona and feel that Moissanite looks much better. Diamonds look plain to us. CZ looks cheap. Moissanite looks great.If you want to pass it off as a diamond, you can. Her friends are amazed when she tells them her stones are not real diamonds.We really like her Moissanite jewelry. I am about to order her 4th set. <end>  beautiful! but mine chipped in less than one year  (  I have a moissanite ... SO beautiful. A huge piece chipped off in less than 1 year, although my diamond (similar wear and tear) lasted 18 years with nary a scratch. I thought moissanites were supposed to be hard! But apparently that's different from shatter-proof  ( <end>  A disappointment  I really was hoping this ring would look similar to a diamond but when I got it, right away I could tell it wasn't even close. Then I put it up against a real diamond and two cubic zirconia rings and it absolutely looks more like a CZ than anything else. I bought this ring based on the other two good reviews but I have to disagree, this ring is a disappointment. Save your money and just buy a CZ or spend more and buy the real thing. <end>
 B000K7D5BO  Silver Diamond Initial Pendant "C" with Silk Cord ||	  SILVER DIAMOND INITIAL PENDANT  This was purchased for my granddaughter. We are very pleased with the quality and it is actually better than pictured. Wondering why it came with a chain instead of the silk cord. Good seller, fast shipping, would recommend and would buy from again. <end>
 B000K7M2F4  Completely Handcrafted - Designer Sterling Silver Garnet Stud Earrings ||	  High quality gems!  I purchased these earrings as a gift, and since the price was so reasonable, I wasn't really expecting that "wow" factor. Well, what a pleasant surprise!These earrings are gorgeous! The garnets are very high quality and the color just pops!They are truly the most beautiful shade of red! I'm going to purchase another pair for myself! <end>
 B000K9Q43I  Classy! 14k White-gold/Yellow-gold Women's Three Stone 1 3/4CT TW Moissanite Anniversary Band ||	  Incredible value  My husband & I had been looking locally for a ring for our 25th. Given the current economy, we didn't want to spend a ton of money, so Moissanite was very attractive to us. A few local stores sell Moissanite, so I was able to see it in person, but the CT TW that I was looking at in the stores was much smaller (1ct tw vs the 1 3/4 ct tw that we purchased), for way more money. We actually paid less for the 1 3/4 ct tw than the 1 ct tw! The ring is just beautiful. When people see it, they can't believe how mouch it sparkles. I haven't told anyone that it isn't a diamond, and they absolutely can't tell!) I also call the people at Rich Peel Enterprise with questions, and they were very helpful. Don't hesitate to purchase this ring. I am very, very pleased with our purchase and can't stop looking at my hand! <end>
 B000K9UJMU  Gorgeous! Women's 14k Yellow-gold 6.50MM (1 CT) Moissanite Solitaire Engagement Ring ||	  5th anniversary now.  Bought the ring 5 years ago for our wedding. Really did a lot of research and this, for us was the winner. It is a very nice ring! <end>

 B000KB9AMI  Sterling Silver Turquoise Cuff Bracelet by Sajen ||	  Beautiful Bracelet  I had been looking for a turquoise bracelet, and this was perfect! It is a nicely-made piece, and the stones match one another very well. I've received several compliments on it already. <end>
 B000KB9AP0  Sterling Silver Deep Red Opalized Glass Drop Earrings by Sajen ||	  Decent pair of earrings  These earrings are decent. I was not overly impressed with them, but I have worn them a few times and am fairly satisfied with their appearance from a reasonable distance. The silver looks handworked, which I like, and the red glass is pretty, but altogether I was still not overcome with pleasure when I emptied the fabric bag containing them. <end>
 B000KBA81U  Dangle CZ Fleur De Lis Earrings ||	  Nice  This is a really nice set of earrings, they dangle nicley, there were a bit smaller than I'd imagined but they are still very nice earrings. <end>  beautiful earrings!  give as a graduation present to daughter. she loves them and received many compliments from friends. then bought another pair as a graduation gift for her friend! <end>
 B000KBBBT8  Sterling Silver Garnet Ring by Sajen, Size 8 ||	  Absolutely Gorgeous...  Of all the Sajen rings I have (approx. 16), this is probably the most beautiful one I own. The stone is really unbelievable -- a very dark red -- and the faceting of the stone is spectacular. The silver of the ring is also exquisite, both in color and in its high polish. The silver is almost a white silver, it is that bright. And the weight of the ring is substantial; as with all Sajen rings, the band is very thick and sturdy. As for the design -- there are silver swirls not only on the band, but also on the vertical sides of the gemstone setting, which you cannot really see in the photo, but which is hinted at in the description. This ring is stunning enough for evening wear, yet it is such a neat size, you could easily wear it to the office. <end>
 B000KBC8HW  Pastel CZ Sterling Silver Bracelet- Clearance Final Sale ||	  beautiful bracelet  The bracelet fits perfect and I have a tiny wrist. The silver is stunning and shiny. The stones are very light in color, probably would have preferred a bit brighter color. But the stones are definitely very pretty. The bracelet is lightweight, which I did not expect. It looks elegant and I would highly recommend. <end>
 B000KBC8WC  Plain Jane's Triple Circle Sterling Silver Earrings ||	  wrong pictures-different in person  I will be honest with you all customers. i purchase this earrings directly from this company but when it arrived, the design of three circle was just all same sized circle, and was not like in the pictures. so disappointing. you should be careful before you order it if you really are looking for exactly same design earrings like in the pictures. also this company were really so late response all the time and so late for the refund too. so disappointing. i have no confident in this company and would never purchase again from this seller. <end>
 B000KBC8Z4  8mm Sterling Silver Bead Earrings ||	  8 mm Sterling Silver Bead Earings  Beautiful earrings at a great price! Would highly recommend this item to the buyer that wants a quality set of sterling silver earrings at a great price! <end>  Great buy! Practical gift!!  This is a great idea for yourself or as a gift. Anyone would appreciate the quality of this pair of earrings and the price isn't bad either!! <end>
 B000KBC93K  Sparkling CZs by the Yard Gold Vermeil Necklace ||	  CZ by the yard - Eve's Addiction  A bit disappointed by the quality - very small stones, and delicate chain. It looked more substantial in the advert. However, given its price reasonable value for money. <end>
 B000KBDFS8  Sterling Silver, Amethyst and Moonstone Pendant by Sajen ||	  Smaller than expected...  The necklace overall is gorgeous, but a lot smaller than I expected. I initially bought as a gift for my sister, but my mom's birthday came and I needed a necklace to match her "nickel-free" sterling bracelet that I bought elsewhere. I took my chances knowing that pure sterling should have no nickel, though this necklace was not labeled as "nickel-free". I gave it to my mom, and amazingly she had NO reaction. She loves it and if she can wear it, any nickel allergy sufferer can. <end>
 B000KBDFVK  Sterling Silver and Amethyst Ring by Sajen, Size 7 ||	  Wonderful Ring!  Great quality! Love the ring. I have large fingers (size 9), but this ring actually makes my fingers look great!Thanks! <end>  At last, a truly purple amethyst!  I had heard of the Sajen mark of quality. But, the designs have always been too ornate for my taste - until I was fortunate enough to have found this beautiful ring. It is a lovely shade of purple with a magnificent cut. The size is large, about a 1/2" to 3/4" from top to bottom (and I like to wear a big "statement" ring on my right hand, despite my petite frame.) The design was refreshingly streamlined with no unnecessary flowers or squiggles. There is an extremely generous amount of silver used. The stone is well protected on all four sides (I know because I accidentally dropped it in the sink - no damage at all!) The thick band in the back makes it extremely comfortable, and I am not afraid to do work while I wear it.Here is one case where the ring is nicer than it's picture. I can only suggest, from my experience, to order a 1/2 size up. My particluar ring was tight and had to be worn on an undesignated finger. I really didn't mind! Sajen, "Please design a few more pieces that are as streamlined as this - I had been looking for an amethyst ring like this for a very long time." Thank you! <end>  I agree!  Definitley a winner, looks as described, very eye catching. Though the stone is not as colorful, it's received positive comments and i love wearing it. <end>  Balinese Beauty  This is probably the most conservative ring you'll ever see from Sajen (Offerings, the Balinese design/manufacturing company). It is large and the amethyst is, too, but it's not overstated because of the simplicity of the design. Sajen puts A LOT of silver in their pieces, good gems and a smooth, comfortable finish on the finger. Quality stuff. OK, so I'm a big fan of theirs - I guess it shows! <end>
 B000KBEEKQ  Red Enamel Band Of Hearts Ring ||	  Pretty in Picture but very fragile, lil sloppy, etc.  This ring looks very pretty and cute in the photo. However this ring has some flaws... 1) ring is very tiny and thin (more than looks in photo), 2) ring is not a true size 6 (so if buy probably should get 1 size up) and 3) Red enamel is a lil sloppy in person (Idk if every copy of ring is like one I got but mine the red did not stay inside the heart. it bleed over to heart edge n side on some hearts). The positives... 1) it's silver, 2)pretty shade of red and 3) If you like hearts this ring is 4 u. So if one is gonna buy just be aware that the ring is very delicate and fragile so you will have to be very careful with it and take very good care of it and want to buy one size up if your fingers are not a small/barely size 6 or big size 5. On a side note I would rate the seller Eve's Addiction MUCH higher than the ring. I give the ring a 3 out of 5 stars and EA 4.8 out of 5 stars. <end>  This ring is pretty but the picture is decieving.I  I bought this ring to go with the Queen of Hearts enamel heart necklace they have. The pictures make it look fairly normal size but it is in fact tiny. The hearts are a beautiful red enamel but they are small. The ring does fit great and looks cute but not what i expected size wise. <end>  Very cute  My hubby got me this ring and I love it so much! It has definitely become one of my favorites. <end>
 B000KBEF2S  Sparkling Sterling Silver Three Stone Right Hand Ring ||	  Beautiful but a bit too chunky  While this ring is absolutely stunning to look at, it's meant for a person with larger hands where the scale of this ring would be more appropriate. I have average sized hands with a bit of extra padding (wear a size 7 ring) and this ring was just a little too broad/wide and deep.I'm a new fan of Eve's Addiction and the quality of their products is quite excellent. I'm definitely going to exchange this for another smaller scale product! <end>
 B000KBEG9A  The American Flag Enamel Ring ||	  American Flag Ring  As a National Guard wife, I love to wear patriotic jewelry. This ring is perfect. I have gotten several compliments. The colors are great, and it fits right where you can see all the colors, not just part of the flag effect. The rounded shape makes it comfortable to wear. <end>  Not enough luster...  The ring didn't have enough luster or detail for me. Didn't care for the inside of the ring either. Not rounded solid on the inside, but rounded hollow like a trench. <end>  Patriotic Ring  I used to own a cheap two ring set by Tommy Hillfigger that got more comments than rings 100 times the price. Alas, it was cheap  cubic zirconia, enamel colors that faded over time and the jewels fell out. I wanted something to replace it, so the search for an elegant, cheap US flag themed ring led me to this ring. It is higher quality than my last since the band is made of silver alloy, it has cheap jewels and uses enamel that will fade, but that is to be expected since it costs so little. The ring when worn, is very pretty, worth the price, though since the band has a hollow and concave interior it will fit much looser than a typical ring of the same size. I recommend this ring, and it has served me well thus far. <end>  Review of The American Flag ring  The ring is beautiful. I have gotten many compliments on it. I would reccomend it. <end>  huge brownie points  I bought this for my mom a while back (I missed the sale, boo hoo) and she absolutely loved it. I had it sent to her and, when she showed it to me in person, I wanted to get it for myself as well <end>  American Flag Ring  As a National Guard wife, I love to wear patriotic jewelry.

 B000KBG30K  Sterling Silver Polished Dangling Heart Necklace with 18" Snake Chain ||	  Love It, very well made  This necklace is sturdy and strong; the chain is not going to break on you under normal wearing. The clasp is sturdy and well made. Not to mention its pretty. It's now my favorite necklace. I just love it! <end>
 B000KBG9WC  18k White Gold Prong-Set Engagement Ring Setting with Ruby Sidestones ||	  Engagement Ring  I bought this for my girlfriends engagement ring.it looks so pretty and match perfectly with a diamond. <end>
 B000KBGHWY  8mm Sterling Silver Bead Necklace ||	  Great Necklace  The necklace was a big hit with my wife. It is well made with a strong clasp and a strong chain. I had previously bought the matching bracelet to this necklace. Great items I highly recommend. <end>
 B000KBGIWI  Designer Inspired Silver Fleur De Lis Blue Enamel Ring ||	  It was a gift and they loved it  I bought this for my sister after she saw it online and asked for it. I was nervous about ordering a ring online but she assured me that she knows her size. The 8 was a perfect fit for her size 8 finger and she loved the ring. <end>  Fleur de Lis Ring  The ring is so pretty. Unknown to me my daughter had been wanting this ring for the last 5 months. When I saw it here, I figured it would be a nice birthday present. She will be leaving soon to go live in England. My intention was to give her something to remember Louisville. Both she and I were so excited and amazed that I got her what she had been wanting. I guess there is something to Mom's intuition. <end>  Blue Enamel Ring with Fleur de Lis Design  This ring EXCEEDED my expectations. I was afraid that the wide arms of the Fleur de Lis would be "too floppy" (or rounded) but the design was quite crisp and beautifully crafted to the proper proportions. My Presbyterian church is extending friendship to an Episcopal church in NYC, and our theme for this joint venture is called "Faith Connection", in Old English font. The Fleur de Lis is the symbol/graphic for this campaign, and is a tangible visual of support for it. I only wish that the ring came in LARGER sizes than 9, which fit me perfectly. I hope that you enjoy this ring as much as I do! <end>  Love it!  I got this as a gift off of my wish list. Just as pretty as the Hidalgo version, MUCH less expensive! I love it, even though it's just a tiny bit too big. <end>
 B000KBNDH6  Stainless Steel Engraved Chinese Character High Polish Flat Band ||	  Beautiful!  This is exactly what I wanted... I couldnt have made it better myself. It's beautiful...it's been a year and it has not tarnished, scratched, etc...and it's for my husband who wears it everyday to work... I'd definitely buy it if I were you. <end>

 B000KCUBAW  Light Bulb Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Impossible to believe.  el producto llego defectuoso, uno de los bombillos que forman parte del cuffinks estaba desprendido.Estas cosas deberian de cuidarse y no ocurrir con sus clientes. lamentablemente quedo muy insatisfecho y sin saber a donde efectuar el reclamo de calidad correspondiente. <end>
 B000KCX16I  Amazon.com  Stainless Steel and Black Link Bracelet Men&#39;s 8.75&quot; by Bucasi  Clothing ||	  fell apart  it looked cool, but it fell apart. i had to put it in the shop to get all the links redone. once again you get what you pay for. <end>
 B000KDBDVW  Rhodonite Band Lovely Color Gemstone Ring Size 5 to 12 ||	  Caveat emptor - Let the buyer beware  I wish there was a NO STAR rating!I ordered this item, received it very quickly, wore it once and it broke in half. I emailed the vendor, explained what had happened and that I had not, in any way, abused the ring. Apparently breaking in half happens quite frequently with this item because they emailed back telling me that this ring is fragile. Well I was well aware of this little flaw by then, but it might have been nice of them to mention it before I purchased the ring. They also spelled out their return and exchange policies - both of which call for the item you wish to return or exchange to be in pristine condition. Well, since it's already in two pieces guess I'm S.O.L.The ring is inexpensive and I didn't expect it to be fantastic (I did think I would be able to wear it more than once though). What bothers me is the fact that the seller knew this ring was defective or just plain poorly engineered before they sold it and apparently just didn't care. Desperate to get a few bucks? That's pretty sad. With this attitude, I predict they won't be in business much longer.Bottom line is  If you're even tempted to purchase this item and you actually want to wear it - DON'T BOTHER, you'll be left with a tiny pile of pink rubble for your efforts. Of course, if you want to buy it for display purposes - go right ahead, it may stand up to occasional dustings, I'm not sure. <end>  beautiful natural rhodonite  i love this gemstone, but it is not terribly strong or tough. i use as a thmb ring to remind me to be loving. i have bought two of them and both are very pink without black inclusions which are inherent in this stone. <end>  Absolutely beautiful.  This Rhodonite ring is gorgeous. It is the kind of pink color that I like and has specs of green in it, I mean I think it's green. As I already have a ring band like this in Aventurine I already know that these rings are a bit fragile. That's why I odered 2 and will wear it carefully. For this price I might order more in a different size. The ring bands arrived in two very cute gift boxes. Thanks Amazon for your excellent service. <end>  Fragile but Fabulous  I love the ring. It is fragile which is to be expected since this is a rock not a metal. I love the natural stone. It was shipped very quickly and fit perfectly. Thank you <end>  Picture better than product  picture doesn't show black lines thru the ring. The sizing chart is off by a half a size and as soon as I received it, I took it out the box and it fell on the linoleum and cracked. Product is cheap made and cheap in price - I guess you get what you pay for - a waste of time. <end>  broken  it did, in fact, crumble in my hand an hour after I put it on. I remember wondering during just which part of my morning commute had I been nailing deck screws in with my hands or something to have achieved this incredibly unfortunate result. Upon inspection when I picked up the pieces from the floor of my car where I'd dropped them in disgust, I realized how intensely porous and fragile the stone was... maybe this ring should come with a disclaimer  wear gloves so that touching a steering wheel or a cup of coffee during a drive doesn't shatter it lol <end>  GENUINE RHODONITE BAND GEMSTONE RING  PRODUCT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY NICE AND SAFE AND IT IS A VERY NICE RING. <end>  Rhodonite band  This is a beautiful Rhodonite band from Gem Avenue. It doesn't have the black lines through it like Rhodonite stone, but that's fine with me.Regarding a previous review about the band breaking. I noticed in the comments regarding the black onyx from this company, that they warn you the ring is fragile. Perhaps that reviewer is the reason they advise the consumer about the possibilities. I still think the ring is beautiful and its made from stone, not gold, silver or platinum. I have seen Rhodonite in catalogs and they are at least $40 when set in silver. This one fits my price range and I don't wear it every day.A beautiful ring and my fingers appreciate the smooth finish inside the ring. <end>  Rhodinite Ring  I like the ring a lot but the sizing chart was off. When I placed my present ring on the chart it showed a size 10. When I got the ring it fit my first finger instead of my third. <end>  Solid Gemstone Band  The illustration really speaks for itself. The band issolid gemstone in a lovely red-violet color. rounded on the outside, but flat on the inside to better hug the fin-ger. It is finished off with a flawless satiny polishing.As the product information states, it should be kindly treated as should all fine pieces of jewelry. It will then give you pleasure for many years. <end>
 B000KDDA2C  Sterling Silver Crystal Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Pretty Crystal Earrings  The crystal on these are just the right size and really shine, even under your hair. <end>  beautiful  I bought these for two pre teen girls on my Christmas list.

 B000KDL5QU  CZ WEDDING RINGS - Triple Stackable CZ Wedding Set ||	  LOVE my ring.  I am very happy with my new ring. I Like wide bands, but on my short fingers they don't look right.

 B000KFSJ6W  Powell Nostalgic Oak Armoire Vanity ||	  Extremely Satisfied  Other companies were selling this same product for a much higher price and I was concerned that this was a cheap knockoff of the real thing. I was completely surprised when I received it to find out how well built it real is. My husband was impressed and he is hard to satisfy when it comes to well built furnishings. The quality is much more than I expected and it was very easy to assemble. I will get many years of use out of this vanity. I would recommend this company and this vanity. <end>  Great Item -Shipping company sucks  Once I received the item it was priceless. Easy to assembly only top to attach to the side drawer piece & the legs to bench & unit plus the mirror and it was doneOnly don't expect the Estes shipping company not to play football with package and take forever to get it too you because it's Columbus Location doesn't know how to ship properly to it's Ft Wayne location <end>  COLOR NOT THE SAME AS IN PHOTO  Received item within a week. great. On the other hand was so dissapointed in the color I received. I thought I had ordered the Oak in the photo which is printed on the invoice and in the photo to be a lighter color. That is not what I received. I received the vanity in what looks like a cherry-walnut color stain. My husband had put it together when I was at work otherwise it would have went back. does not match the furniture in the room. Overall it is a nice vanity. Dissapointed in the color. <end>  Beautiful product  I just love this armoire! When I purchased it for our new home my husband kept telling me how crazy i was to buy a piece of furniture on line. I read all the reviews ( well almost all) so I had some ammunition to explain how everyone was so pleased with the quality and appearance of this armoire. It arrived two months before our move so I was worried about not having all the parts ( someone had said they did not get all their parts). Well no need to worry , everything was there and it looks marvelous in my new bedroom. The quality is excellent and the look is very sweet. I knew I was going to still be using my lighted make-up mirror on it and I am still pleased with it. the only suggestion I would have is they make a unit with lights around the mirror and make the mirror just a bit larger. I have to say my husband is thrilled with the look and quality of this piece of furniture. It is worth every penny . I use it every day and am thrilled at the size of the jewelry part of this armoire.I looked on line at several sights and Amazon was the best price with free shipping! A great buy! <end>  Great buy  This is a great little vanity. When you first look at it it looks small but once you sit on it you see it is the perfect height. Has a lot of drawer space and is well made. My husband did say it took a while to put together. That's probably the only negative thing I can say! <end>  Well Pleased  Great item! I love it. Easy to put together. Arrived in a timely manner. Looks great. Did I say I love it? <end>  Not worth the Money for what you get - too expensive  Purchased this item for my girlfriend. Recieved it damaged. Returned it and revieved the second one damaged, waiting for parts. The vanity is cheaply made, but looks nice. The wood is not matched - half is light colored and the other side is dark. Somewhat difficult to assemble. This item is from a third party and if you have a problem you have to contact the company who shipped it, takes some time to get everything fixed - several weeks. <end>  Love this Vanity!  I absolutely love this vanity. The only thing is, while it's not the worst thing I ever had to assemble, it's up there. When I opened the box and reviewed the instructions, I set it aside until my husband and I could work on it together. It took us around 4 or 5 hours to put it together. With all the parts laid out we had to put our 2 cats in another room and gated off the bedroom so our 2 dogs couldn't get in; they sat there whining until they fell asleep. Now that it's assembled I can say, it was worth the effort. As the instructions say, it's very important to do the steps in order. Also, to pay attention to the size of the screws. A couple of screws were a little tight but we lubricated them with a little oil and they went in easily. I have now put all my jewelry away, finding some things I had forgotten about; everything has a place. It looks beautiful in our bedroom! It's quite a sturdy piece of furniture, not at all flimsy. If you're not quite sure, I say get it. <end>  Beautiful  I (female- not really used to assembling such things) put this together. It was a bit time consuming, but very do-able and it looks fantastic! Such a great multi-functional piece of furniture! <end>  Very nice vanity, bad shipping  I bought this for my wife for a dressing vanity. This vanity is very well made and easy to assemle. Needless to say, When ups delivered it, someone had ran a fork lift into the box, punching 2 holes into the top, missing the vanity somewhat. While assembling the vanity,i found several minor scratches on the wood. After contacting the seller, they promply refunded me 10% on my purchase. Not half of what it cost me to repair it. Next time I will be a little smarter and refuse a damaged box from UPS and let the seler eat the returned freight cost. But all in all', I would reccomend this item to anyone. Thank you Amazon <end>  Makes a great laptop desk, with one caveat.  After a long search, my wife decided on this one as her laptop desk/vanity for the bedroom. We ordered from amazon after inspecting one that was fully assembled in a local store, so we already knew we liked the color and the style. We didn't attach the mirror because she wants to see out the window when she uses the laptop. Without the mirror there are 4 smoothly machined and nicely stained 3/8" holes over a sixteen inch span along the top at the back. The laptop pretty well hides the holes so you'd hardly notice, and I'm pretty sure we'll find something nice looking to plug them with. Meanwhile, she's happy, so I'm happy.OK, a second caveat, besides the holes. Check and recheck the price plus shipping.

 B000KFUDLG  Powell Jamestown Landing Bench ||	  Gorgeous Bench  This bench is just perfect. It is a quality piece of furniture. Very comfortable seating. It arrived very quickly. I could not be more pleased. <end>  Matched our furniture perfectly  We recently purchased a bedroom suite and needed a short stool to use to put on shoes. Rather than travel all over town looking at furniture stores, we decided to shop on line. We are so glad we did. We used a Google image search, and found the stool and style we thought would work. Amazon had the best price so we ordered. We were very pleased that it did match the stain and style of the wood in our new bedroom suite perfectly. Each leg bolts on securely and easily. The seat cushion and wood appear to be of excellent quality. We placed it beneath a full length mirror we mounted on the wall behind it. It looks great and we look forward to years of service. <end>  Perfect in my bedroom  I was delighted to find this vanity stool to put in our bedroom. It's sturdy, well-crafted and beautifully matches our bedroom set. It's a very nice accent and provides a safe place for my husband with PD to sit. <end>  nice vanity bench  I bought this stool to match my existing vanity and it's the perfect match... the wood is very rich looking. The seat fabric is more of a gold color rather than a tan. Very well made and was easy to assemble! Fast ship! <end>  NilCommunication  I have ordered many items with Amazon over the years and this is by far the WORST experience I have had. I was told that the item was being prepared for shipments and would ship June 30th thru July 2nd. It is now July 6th and I have not received an update. I also contacted Amazon customer service and have not received an update from them either. I do alot of online ordering and will try to order via Amazon whenever possible, I'm going to rethink that now as I recommend you do also. <end>

 B000KFWNUK  Silver Chef Cook Hat Cufflinks ||	  Even better in person  I found these and wasn't as excited about them as I was the others, but once I saw them in person, they were one of my favorites. These have more of a "matted' look then a glossy- which makes them look nicer. I was very impressed with the quality as well. Solid, no rusty looking indentations. Very nice product. <end>

 B000KFY5R4  Powell Natural Maple Jewelry Armoire ||	  Great design. Doesn't ship well.  I shopped and shopped for a light colored armoire with simple lines and I fell in love with this design. I tried to have two delivered and in both cases it simply wasn't packed well enough to withstand shipping and so the doors were sprung and damaged. Still, I was not at all disappointed with the design and the wood veneer. But, I gave up on trying to have it shipped the third time. <end>  Great for a woman with a large collection of jewelry  Made with lots of storage for jewelry.The side doors open to hang necklaces.It was the only one that had so muchstorage and it also matches our furniture.So far, very happy with my husband'sChristmas gift to me a few years ago. <end>

The pin is nice quality and appealing to the eye......and at a good price! <end>  Bumblebee Crystal Accent Pin  I started a group called the Hunnys after we reconnected at our 40th. high school reunion in 2011. Our emblem is the Bee so this was the perfect bee for each lady to be officially pinned at our Hunnys Bee Pinning Ceremony. <end>  I like the pin  I really like the pin, but the fastener broke the very first time i wore it, just came unglued. Cheap! <end>

The jade stones are smooth and the filigree is very nice looking. I have enjoyed wearing it. <end>  Beautiful but small sizing  The ring is really, really pretty and I would have kept it if it would have fit, but, it was sized small so I am returning it.

And it arrived sooner than expected. Amazingly Happy in FloridaChristina Thornburgh <end>  JAde  Jade looks like plastic bobbles, but the color of metal is cool and I really like design. I normally wear silver, so this is a nice change. <end>  Very Pretty  Very pretty ring. Very classic looking. Gold is a bit to yellow for me thus looking a bit fake but it is so can't really complain to much. The stones are beautiful and looks great on. <end>  Wow  I had put this ring in my cart as I was unsure about it. I thought it looked pretty but it also had the potential to look awful. My husband saw it in my cart and thought he would get it to surprise me.IT'S GORGEOUS. I LOVE IT! Just got it right now and it looks so interesting. The jade is definitely beautiful and the antiqued look is just so different. It's really something that I couldn't imagine will look this good.For 20 bucks..totally worth it. Wearing it right now  ) <end>  Great value for the money  Happily surprised to find this great ring at such a low price. Will definitely shop this vendor again. <end>  Looks good  This ring looks very pretty on. I recommend getting a size larger than you usually wear. <end>  Ok ring  This ring only gets three stars due to the coloring of the band. The band is not as it looks in the picture, it is much more &#34;gold&#34; looking,making the ring look cheap, and not antique, as shown in the picture.It's an ok ring, I just wish it looked like the picture. I kept the ring, but don't wear it as much as I would if it had looked like the photo. <end>  Love  I bought this as a birthday present. Opened it to see it before I gave it and it is absolutist beautiful! <end>  Nice!  I love this ring & have been wearing it to work or w/jeans. Well made & the photo of the ring is on point. <end>  Very Pretty!  The look of this ring is very flattering and elegant. Size is good, stones look good too and are well held to the structure. Too bad it has no matching earrings. Won't disappoint you! <end>
 B000KGKMW0  1/2 TCW Pear-Shaped and Round Cubic Zirconia Goldtone Metal Cable Chain Angel Pendant 18&quot; ||	  pendant review  Delivered with good speed and packaging, but unsatisfactory product. It looks like it came out of a cereal box. Don't waste your money. <end>
 B000KGMT7Q  Simulated Pearl 14k Yellow Gold-Plated with Enamel Accents Religious Cross Pendant and Chain 18&quot; ||	  Just What I Expected  I bought this necklace just to have a cheap necklace to wear everyday. The color was darker than expected, but the length was great. Unfortunately, two of the pearls fell off after a few weeks of wear. I glued them back in place, though, and they have stayed on since. <end>  Cross Pendant  The pendant was nice, color online looked more turquoise but it was a darker blue. Still nice pendant for a good price. <end>
 B000KGOVTU  Crystal Butterfly Silvertone Pin ||	  Upset customer  After recieving the wrong order I called customer service, they instructed me to ship the wrong package back and they would send the right one. It should have been a pre paid return label and I should not have had to pay shipment. That was not the case, after recieving the package back I called customer service again, yet again instructed me to send the wrong order back. Also told me if I didn't send it back in a reasonable amount of time they would charge me for the wrong order. Again I recieve the package back. All together I recieved the wrong package back 3 times and finally paid for shipment just so they wouldn't charge my credit card. After calling customer service they told me that they had given me all the discounts they could, I'm not sure what discount I got but I don't remember it! <end>

 B000KHL1KG  Sterling Silver Clear Crystal 27mm Star Pendant Charm Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  I love it  I love this unique chunky pendant! Each side has a different cut, one side is more faceted and the other side has clean lines. It sparkles and picks up many different colors. I think it looks nice with a sterling silver necklace or a choker. I took it out of the box, put it on right away and am still wearing it! <end>  very cute pendant  I got this pendant to wear on a longer chain & it looks great! would look great as a choker as well. <end>  Swarovski Star Pendant  I paired this with a sterling silver seed bead necklace and every time I wear it I am asked, 'where did you get that necklace?' It is beautiful. I love the size- not too big- not too small. Very satisfied ;) <end>  Love it!  Ordered this one because the first one I received was so nice, Gem Avenue products come in perfect condition. Love the clear Star Pendant, if you want great service and great quality order from Gem Avenue! <end>  Sooo pretty!!  This is the second star I've purchased. My friend really loved this so I gave her my first one. I LOVE this pendant!! <end>  Nice item...  This is a nice sparkly star. To me, the Swarovski elements are obvious and I like the size. It's nice and chunky, but not too chunky. Nice! <end>  swarovski star  Nice gift for the money. However, you get what you pay for. No written evidence that it is a swarovski. If you know swarovski, it is not the same quality. Pretty piece but nothing like the real thing! <end>

Had a lot of compliments on the ring. It arrived is just a few days. <end>  Looks beautiful!  This ring is so nicely made, I love wearing it.

 B000KKTD08  Purple Mermaid Stone Stack Bracelet ||	  Purple Mermaid Stone Stack Bracelet  I've recently started collecting stone stack bracelets. I bought a black one from Dubai, and a Jade one from London. After searching online, I found this one from the Purple Store. It's gorgeous! I love it sooo much that I'm going to get the purple bracelet (not to be confused with this one, which is the purple mermaid bracelet) with my next order from Amazon.comPlease note  This bracelet is a pearlescent purple. It says so in the specifications, which I did not read, so I was kinda' expecting a dark purple bracelet. It's all good though. I'm extremely satisfied with my bracelet  ) <end>
 B000KL3YHA  Sterling Silver Womens Band Princess Cut Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Ring Size 5 6 7 8 9 10 ||	  Amazing  This ring is amazing i had doubts but i love it!!!! The setting is great the stone is not loose at all! The size is right on the money!!!!! It looks amazing on my finger and with my wedding band i also ordered off of amazon!!!!! I could not be happier with my purchase and the price is amazing! And it got here early!!!! No complaints at all  ) <end>  Great Ring  The ring is very beautiful and exquisite. I would highly recommend it. This was exactly what we were hoping for! <end>  Not High Quality  Was not expensive and you get what you pay for. The setting was somewhat sloppy (rough under the &#34;stone&#34;) and very plain looking. It is not too bad but it is obviously fake. I would recommend simply because it is sterling silver. Obviously mass produced. Again I would recommend for the price. <end>  Does not look real at all  The smaller size does not matter with this ring it looks super fake! Mine looked so plastics I was embarrassed to even wear it on my right hand. I bought the ring just to try different styles with my wedding bands. The price was right for a trail ring but nothing else. This ring is going in my junk drawer. <end>  Beautiful!  Wow! this ring is wonderful its so simple! Its perfect! it is an amazing quality just by the way that it sparkles! I love it! <end>  Nice ring and very good fit  It's a nice ring. Simple and elegant.What I liked best was that the ring was exactly what it was advertised to be. <end>  Beautiful!  This ring is so beautiful. You won't fool anyone into thinking it's a real diamond, but it's so cute I still get compliments on it all the time. It's so nice to have something shiny and not too gaudy to wear all the time. I love it! <end>  perfect but the band is not  I purchase this ring as a gift to my wife. She fell in love on the first sight as she did not notice it wasn't a real diamond until I told her that it was fake. She didn't even believe that I got the ring for about $20 including the S&H. Her only complain was the band was not perfectly finished. It was a little rough. This is my first purchase here on amazon and I would be purchasing more. I gave a 5 star rating because the ring was worth the price. <end>  fantastic!  Beautiful ring! Great price! The pictures don't do it justice! BEAUTIFUL! You won't be dissatisfied at all! I love it! Dose not look like a cz! <end>  Love it!  I got this to keep guys away from me. It's very pretty and looks real! Fits well and does the job! I've had it on for about 4 months and it hasn't faded or turned green and its still so shiny! Love this ring. Thought about getting more! <end>  Amazing!  My now-fiance and I were looking for "cheap" wedding rings since we're young(18/19) and are saving up money for a house rather than expensive gold and diamonds. After looking at many different rings, I fell in love with this and the .925 Sterling Silver CZ Eternity Band..especially the price! I was a little afraid that it would look noticeably fake, but the reviews were pretty good. I don't think that it looks fake at all. The size is really great, I definitely wanted a smaller stone. I had actually wanted a round-cut originally but the one offered by this company is too big (I ordered that one too..still got all three rings for under $40!). My parents and fiance are the only ones who know how much my ring cost, would tell the in-laws but they can't keep secrets. My fiance doesn't want everyone to think he's cheap because if I asked, he would buy me a $3000 ring. I'm so glad I found this ring because everyone thinks it was more expensive and nobody has honestly questioned if the stone is real or not. I've actually got comments about how it shines. So my fiance and are both very pleased with the ring. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a real-looking solitare ring for cheap or young couples (or couples that just don't want to spend the money for gold/diamonds)..it's a steal!Gem Avenue was very quick with delivery also..ordered on a Monday night and received the rings on Friday afternoon (with standard shipping).By the way  The band I got to match is $20 from the same company also..it has CZs all around and the sparkle is amazing. (.925 Sterling Silver CZ Eternity Band). Everyone that I've shown loves it, too! <end>  perfect  This ring is just stunning. no one knows it isnt real. It is sweet and delicate and I love it. <end>  beautiful ring but not flawless  This is such a beautiful and delicate ring on the hand. It CZ is brilliant and has good "fire" but I doubt if anyone who ever saw a real quality diamond before would mistaken this ring for real unless they're more than an arms length away. It's a decent size stone and not gaudy or fake looking and for $7, an unbelievable price even though the thickness of the band is uneven; only noticeable to the wearer. It came in a beautiful silver heart shape box with a pink bow, perfect for gift. The 2 other items I bought from this vendor, I would give simialr reviews. <end>  I love it!!!  I really like this ring. It's all that I expected and for a good price. I will definitely buy other rings from this company. I am really pleased with how it fits also. I wear a size 5 and it fits just right. <end>  I'm in love!  I needed a 'place holder' engagement ring. I found this one and decided to try it. When I got it (ordered it on Friday, shipped Monday, received Thursday), I was very nervous. Since it had to pass as an engagement ring, it needed to look as real as possible. I opened the box and started jumping around as soon as I saw it. It's beautiful! If you look at it closely, you can tell it's not real, but if you just glance at it, it won't be a problem. I highly suggest! I added a picture of mine, the picture doesn't do it justice, I promise! <end>  Can't tell it's fake!!!  I bought this ring as a replacement for my real engagement ring, because i have a nasty habit of losing things, I'm tempted to buy a couple more just for back up, this ring is perfect, i'm not even going to wear my real one anymore. This has been mistaken 2 times by jewlers for an expensive 1200$ diamond. Until they get it under a microscope )Great ring, really, This is the one you want!!!! <end>  Exactly what I was looking for  My orginal engagement diamond is set in gold. I wanted a ring I could wear with silver jewerly. This ring is exactly what I was looking for...Not to big or fake looking. I have small hands and it doesn't set up off of my finger to get caught on everything. Since I bought this ring I have had several people remark that they couldn't believe that I have a silver set "diamond" and a gold set diamond...IF only they knew. <end>  Adorable!!!!!  This ring is so cute and it really sparkles. It's not too big so no one is likely to question it's authenticity. It looks real and the price is amazing. It could be a promise ring or a simple engagement ring. If you are rough on your jewery and feel uncomfortable wearing the real thing on a daily basis than this little ring will make you happy. I'll definately be checking out what other goodies Gem Avenue has. <end>  Looks good  I bought this ring as a 'fake' to wear on an upcoming trip and it fits the bill perfectly. It's very cute, and the cz is about .5 cm by .5 cm so it looks like a realistic enough size for what a normal diamond would look like. I bought it along with this band and they stack very well.Silver 3 MM High Polish Wedding Band Plain Ring Size 8 <end>  Worth the money  I bought this product to simulate my own wedding ring when it went to be repaired for a couple days. All though it is silver and cubic, I got so many compiments on it about how shiney it is. No one even knows it is a "cover up" ring  ) Thanks guys for a good looking product. <end>  mostly good  the ring is very pretty, fits like a glove..i wear a 7 and got a 7 and it fits perfectly. it comes in a cute box too. VERY fast shipping, USPS site said i wouldnt get it until july 2nd, and here it is on the 28th.  ) very happy with the shipping. i love everything about the ring, except my stone came loose..if i shake my hand i can hear it rattle..and im afraid it might fall out sometime in the near future. <end>  Gorgeous!!!  This ring is absolutely gorgeous. I have ordered before from Gem Avenue and have been nothing but pleased. The customer service is great, always kind and courteous. The shipping is fast! The quality of this ring is amazing, it looks real, it sparkles like its brand new even when it needs to be cleaned! Love it and I love Gem Avenue! <end>  Classic/Classy Pick.  BEAUTIFUL RING! simple and sheek. Not over the top but definately a statement piece. Great affordable buy. This is the type of ring that draws attention without being all in your face. Its well worth the purchase-You will be very happy if you like small statement rings. <end>  Wonderful stone size and appearance  This ring is really a steal for the price. It looks incredibly real-the stone is just the right size. The sizing of the ring is very accurate and I've gotten compliments on it from people who thought it was real. My only problem with it is the setting does look a little cheap, but it's one of those things only the wearer would notice. I'm really considering buying this same ring in the emerald cut I like it so much! <end>  looks like the real deal  I'm wearing this ring for almost a week next to my wedding band, and everybody thinks it's the real deal (a real diamond ring).Compared to othe cz jewelry i own, the stone in this ring has very few "rainbow like" reflections that are characteristic to CZ.Compared even with my diamond ring you can't see any difference. <end>  Simply Elegant  I was hesitant to purchase this ring, because I didn't want it to look fake or gaudy. It is neither. The sparkle is mezmorizing. The band is smooth and the setting is perfection. I have actually paired my ring up with a silver band and the set looks amazing. No one even thinks to ask if its real because it just simply looks the part. The size of the stone is not the bulky big stones that you often get. This is the perfect size. Anyone would be a fool to try and buy a real diamond instead of this one. Why waste your money. This one is simply elegant! <end>  Fan-Freaking-Tabulous!  One Of The Cutest and yet most beautiful rings I own. I got it as a.. well basically a back up version of my "Stay away I'm Takin/Not Intrested"Ring, &lt;Haha> And I wanted something that looked like the ring I ordered from Kay. (See I like a lot of vigorous activities and don't wanna mess that ring up or lose it). This Ring Is so awesome it looks just like the picture (dainty and small but very elegant). Several people Have came up to me After switched rings and asked "Who's the lucky chap?s". The only flaw I see is.. oh wait there are none. you get what you paid for, and then some, plus the ring looks just like my real one. Fan-freakin-tab-u-lous! <end>  Awesome looks like the real thing  This item is great. It came right on time and it looks like a real diamond but a lot cheaper. Anyone looking for a starter ring for a little girl or anyone this is a create product. <end>  Ring review  I love the ring- it's simple and beautiful. The band is narrow so my pinky and middle finger don't get pushed away- and the ring sits straight on my finger. Thanks! <end>  beautiful engagement ring!  My husband bought me this ring as a surprise. I didn't have an engagement ring, I just wear my wedding band. After a date night he presented this ring to me, and it is simply stunning. It came in this little adorable gift box. I wear it all the time now. And as a mother of two young ones I have to say that this ring keeps it shine and sparkle wonderfully. Even in bath and dish water. I would and have highly recommended this ring to all of my friends and have received so many compliments as to how beautiful it is. I plan to order more through this seller, hopefully soon! <end>  stunning  Im unfortunately a small woman so its almost impossible to purchase rings without having them sized. I purchased this ring so that I would have something to wear while on vacation and doing things that could otherwise harm my expensive rings. I dont even need my expensive rings now. This ring is stunning, delicate, and beautiful. This ring fits and looks awesum! <end>  Perfect for intended use.  Its a fake ring. there i said it.However, nobody needs to know that. I gave it to my GF to make her smile. She knew it wasn't real(because she knew i couldnt afford it). But she wears it sometimes anyway. for fun. She is also a server in a restaurant and she wears it to ward of the flirting and says it works well.great $10 purchase. <end>  A bit small, but shiny  It's a tad bit small, the band is really thin but really smooth and shiny. The gem itself is very sparkly and dazzling, i bought this for my gf for an engagement ring (yeah I know, I'm super cheap) she had no idea it's not a real diamond. <end>  Great Ring  This ring is great! It is great for the price as I am using it as an everyday wear instead of my real ring. I would highly recommend this product so far. <end>  Good for working hands  I bought this ring to replace my real diamond when I am doing hard work with my hands. The stone is pretty good quality, though I can tell its not a real diamond. The band is not really silver, more on the yellow side. But it is very durable and has not turned my finger green. <end>  I was shocked by this ring! So not what I was expecting!  I got this ring to go with this one...(http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DCLLQG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title)I kept breaking my real set, losing the main diamond each time. (Thankfully, both times I found it!!) I've always been pretty rough on jewlery, but even more so since having an active toddler! So I just wanted something to wear in place of my wedding set, that didn't cost much, but didn't look cheap. This ring is very decent quality! It was so shiny! The band was and stone were both sparkling away (and still do), especially in natural light! I was shocked when I opened the box. (Yes, the box that it comes in is cheap looking. If it's a gift, rebox it. You're paying $3 bucks a band, don't expect a Tiffany's box!) The stone is a great size. Not too big, not too flashy. It also fits nicely on my finger. I wouldn't want a stone any bigger. Also, I held this stone up to the stone of my wedding set, in natural lighting, and they both sparkled all the same. I'm not an expert, I have no idea what makes a diamond "real", but I do know no one can tell. When I do tell people it's not real, they are (also) shocked.I've been wearing them both for a month and a half and they are both standing up very nicely. Through bath time, play time, cleaning, laundry, dishes, etc. Oh, I also love the fact that it's silver!! (Yes, it's real!) I have very (VERY!) sensitive skin. I can NOT wear plated jewlery without being in severe (itchy) pain within a few hours. My finger has yet to turn green, either. ;) All in all, I'm very happy with the product. I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5) simply because the stone sits so low, it's hard to match a band up to it. However, it looks great with the band I linked at the beginning of the review. They don't sit right on one another, the plain band hits the stone setting. But it still looks nice. I get comments all of the time, on how beautiful it is, and on how the band sets.I was (as previously stated) shocked at the quality when I opened the box. It's not at all what I was expecting for such a low price. I'll be doing business with them again in the future! <end>  It looks stunning  We were looking for an engagement ring and came across this one. I have small hands so I didn't want something to big. When is arrived the CZ looks amazing. It looks like a real diamond. It could pass for a real one that you would be spending anywhere from 400-1000$ on. Overall I think this ring looks stunning. <end>  Great value!  I bought this ring to be a replacement for my real engagement ring whose band broke. Money is tight but I didn't want to be ringless. I bought this on Amazon with a giftcard and saw the positive reviews.Upon receiving the ring, I was immediately impressed. It was simple, elegant, and very convincing as "real"(without scrutinizing it too closely) especially for the low price.I've been wearing it a couple weeks now and while I've been afraid to do any "rough" work with it, it still looks great. It does look like the band will scratch easily over time and dull out but it doesn't seem like it will tarnish or leave my finger a weird color.Super impressed. It came in a cute giftbox, although be careful with this box--I rplaced it down on my nice dressed and it knicked up the finish on the top of my dresser. The box has sharp prongs on the bottom of the box that will cut--so be careful with that! <end>  Perfect for a backup  I got this as part of a set to back up my real gold and diamonds. I'm fairly rough on jewelry, as my hands are always in water and cleaning solutions. This stone is a good size. It looks realistic - not too gaudy and fake, as some of the larger stones do. I paired it with the 3mm plain band, and it works for me. My husband was even impressed! I like that its sterling, and not a plated metal, so will withstand what I put it through. The only negative I see, is that the prongs do tend to catch on some things. Tightening them may eliminate that. So, all in all, I would recommend this. <end>  It's a shame...  ...the CZ isn't as good a quality as the ring. But for the price, a fun ring to wear. <end>  Good stand-in ring  I purchased this ring while my engagement band was being sized, and I'm happy with it as an alternative. Do not buy this ring if you want to convince anyone that it's a real diamond, because it is certainly not. But as a placeholder on my finger, it was very satisfactory. I have a 3/4 carat diamond in my engagement ring, and this stone seems fairly comparable in size. I wouldn't get one any larger. If you're looking for a passable ring while yours is getting sized or during pregnancy, I recommend this one. I would not recommend it as a substitute for a more substantial ring if your budget will stretch farther. <end>  Beautiful Ring  My son wanted to get his girlfriend an engagement ring but on a budget, so I came across this one and for the price we thought what do we have to lose?? $13.99?? This ring is absolutely perfect size probably around 1 k and very shiny. I think she will love it! I do!!! <end>  Satisfied so far!  It's perfect so far, doesn't look fake and rock hasn't fallen so, so far so good. Shiny, fit her perfectly, gift box is great mine came in black so it was perfect. <end>  Amazing. Beautiful.  I absolutely love this ring. It's really pretty and doesn't rally look all that fake. I would definitely recommend this to couples who don't want to spends hundreds if dollars on a similar ring. <end>  Gorgeous  I had to replace my original ring due to it needing repair. My original ring, which was "real" had to be re-sized. This one is even more beautiful than mine! It's gorgeous and no one is the wiser... Not too big, either! <end>  love it  i realy love my new ring, it is small, beautiful, gentle very nice and i love it when i see it on my finger  D &lt;3 <end>  Pretty but broke in 3 weeks  I bought this ring 3 weeks ago and the stone already fell out. I'm disappointed. It was pretty, but the part that clamps the jewel down is weak and if you snag it, the prongs bend. Good ring for temp use, but not long term. <end>  happy happy  this ring is beautiful its even prettier than i expected! i have been wearing the sterling silver princess cut ring for a month and it still has a brilliant sparkle the shipping was ver fast 2 days verry happy customer! <end>  It's beautiful  My coworkers thought this is the real deal!(a diamond ring). I couldn't be happier! Thanks for this ring. I recommend it to everyone <end>  Beautiful!  The ring is beautiful! It is smaller than it was going to be but I am happy! Thank you very much! <end>  My girlfriend loves it!  She gets compliments on it all the time! You should see the way her face lights up when people ask her about it! I get my money's-worth every time she gets asked about it! <end>  good deal, for a nice ring  A good deal for a less expensive ring. Very impressed with the delivery time and the quality of this little ring.I would defiantly recommend this ring as well as Gem Avenue to my friends. <end>  FANTASTIC RING  The ring is amazing!!! I read some of the reviews and noticed that there were some negative ones. I however, LOVE THIS RING!!! The ring has been on my finger since I received it, it has not come off what so ever, the ring HAS NOT tarnished or turned my finger green at all. The diamond is still bright and beautiful even though it is fake, it looks real. I'm using it as my engagement ring and I get complements on it all the time. This is a wonderful ring to wear as a fashion statement or as an engagement ring. I will definately buy more product from them. Thanks a lot for producing such a beautiful and cheap ring!!! <end>  Good buy  )  The ring is great for it's price. It fits perfectly, better than most "size 7" rings fit. If you're looking for something on the lower price end, this is a good choice. It doesn't look cheap like other rings of it's price, or even some pricier rings. <end>  Very shinny and realistic like  I do like this ring. I bought it as a temporary promise ring because right now my fianc&eacute;e is in New York and can't give me the engagement ring he bought me. It looks real and is very shinny when the light hits it. It does look kinda cheap from the side view, but if you aren't really paying attention, you don't notice it. The band is the perfect width. Not too small, not too wide. I will be wearing it everyday, very gorgeous ring!!! <end>  I love it  This ring is so beautiful and it doesn't even feel like its on my finger.. I love it love it love it.. The diamond even looks real.... And it came in the mail very fast.. I am very pleased, And so is my husband this ring is perfect used as a wedding ring..... Thank you <end>  okay  pretty nice but is a little thin towards the stone. my wife actually bent the ring because the little CZ got caught on her pocket when she was reaching for her keys. easily bent back but its is not really straight anymore. would i recommend this ring? sure i would, it looks nice and the price is great. <end>  Good thing the price is right.  The ring is beautiful and its not so gaudy that it looks ridiculous on your finger. However, it lasts about a month with fairly regular wear. I wore this approximately 4 days a week for a month before the stone was gone without a trace. <end>  Its a okay ring  Its really cheap and looks good. Bought it about 6 months ago and today the stone fell out. Was hoping it would last a year but still not too bad of a ring. <end>  Great for the price  I've had my ring for about 6 months now I wear it as an engagement ring and I have received several compliments on how beautiful it is. The cz still looks brilliant.Keep in mind though that you are getting what you pay for, the band (visible with the palm side of the band) has worn down a little but the top still looks fine. Just be careful of harsh chemicals etc while wearing the ring.And I can say it IS hypoallergenic I'm allergic to most cheapy metals and this ring doesn't bother me at all.It also is a great 5 size fit, I've had some rings that were too small or slightly too loose, this ring doesn't seem to have that problem. The size of the CZ is a great fit too, pretty but not overbearing. <end>  Loved this ring!  It's a great value N all the reviews said it. I am lil broke so had to return it an my boyfriend took this as a hint and bought me a engagement ring.. Loved it an recommend it highly! <end>  To those whi says it looks teal. HA!  First of all this ring is very small.... It is cute though. I purchase it as a place holder while my wedding rings were being sized. The fit isnt true. I am a 6 and the ring wouldnt stay on top of my finger it rolled aroud. Also, it looks plastic... Nothing real looking about it. <end>  This order was very good.  I am happy with this order. That is why I rate it with 5 stars. It arrived on time and it is good quality. <end>  Beautiful ring  I picked this out after I got engaged, and my fiance bought it for me. I love it so much. It's got a lot of sparkle, and the band is very comfortable on my finger. It's very light. <end>  Exactly as described  Nice ring beauty for the price nice fit lots of compliments looking forward to adding to it real soon ! <end>  Princess cut cubic zirconiavband  Wow! Wow! It is hard to believe.Great ring for the price! Looks great. Very sparkly, shines like the real thing. <end>  Beautiful but delicate ring.  I bought this ring to replace a similar one I lost recently. I'm happy with it, but I think it could be a bit more durable. After just a few days of wear, there are noticeable scratches on the band. Mind you, these scratches are just from doing general daily stuff, not anything rough. I don't mind so much, because the scratches only seem to be a problem on the bottom side of the band where no one sees it.The stone is very pretty. Perfectly sized for my small hands, and not overly shiny like some CZ stones are. I haven't had any trouble snagging anything with it. It seemed to be sized correctly.For the price, I feel like it's just right. This ring is worth exactly what it costs, no more. If you're expecting something worth more, you'll have to pay more. <end>  absolutly beautiful! i love it!  This ring is so pretty. My boyfriend got it for me for christmas and it looks way better than expected! I thought the price was great (I feel bad when he spends money on me so being under $15 was perfect!) and all the reviews were so good! I thought it looked nice in the picture, a cute little single stone ring, and boy, when I opened the box I was surprised! I knew all the reviews said good things but the picture did not do it justice! its so shiny! I've never owned a ring more beautiful! I get so many compliaments already! He gave it to me a few days early so I wore it to work sunday and monday, we're not planning on getting married for a few more years cause we're young, but I wear it on my left hand (I wear my class ring on my right) so many customers told me how pretty and shiny my ring was, and a few even congragulated me for being married! It looks real! We work at the same grocery store and our manager asked if we're engaged and so did the lady at my bank! Its so pretty and looks like it would cost more than $13! I love it! <end>  Very pretty ring  I like this ring. It is very pretty, but I wish the band was just a little bit wider. It is nice if you want a dainty size ring. I will still keep it and wear it. <end>  Sterling Silver Ring  I just love my ring. I found out that I am not alergic to sterling silver and that is great. <end>  The Perfect Gift To Say "I Love You". Cheaply.  I bought this gift for my 19 year old girlfriend of 9 months. I noticed she had been constantly looking at rings on the internet, and she kept talking about how pretty they were for a couple of months. I decided to look into buying her one. I stumbled across this gem (no pun intended) while browsing and read all of the positive reviews, then ordered it. I couldn't be happier with my purchase (and neither could my girlfriend). The ring looks completely real. Everyone kept asking if we were engaged (we aren't, it was just because) and told us how beautiful it looked. Needless to say, I just let them think I spent a fortune ;)The package arrived quickly, and the box it came in is the perfect compliment to this beautiful ring. My girlfriend and I are both thrilled with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants a ring that looks completely legitimate, without having to spend the money on a real one. <end>  Great!  I love this ring, its much better then the one i had before i bought this one , I do housekeeping for my job and use my hands alot but it have not scratched or anything i simply love it <end>  fantastic  I couldn't be happier about this ring. It's beautiful. it came in super fast too. Best amazon order I have made. Definatlty would reccomened to others. <end>  good product for the price!  It's a cute ring for the price. I got this ring as a fake engagement ring that I wear when I don't want to wear my real one (at the beach, pool, etc.) and I like that it comes in my size. It's usually difficult to find costume jewelry that fits my little fingers, so I appreciate this cz ring coming in small sizes. The stone is a nice size so it doesn't look extremely fake (even though it is) or gaudy. It could pass as real from afar. Overall, I'd recommend for purposes like mine, but it may tarnish with everyday use. I'm not sure of this though because I haven't had mine long enough and it's looks good so far. <end>  Love the ring.It does look real. I ordered a size 5  The size 5 was too small for me so I gave it to my daughter and ordered another for myself. My little 6yr old feels very proud to be sporting a real diamond and that she and mommy have matching jewlery. Well worth the price. <end>  loving it  I just got it today.. and its very beautiful and lovely. I really love this one.Its look real. Im gonna wear it now. And this vendor was good too.. I brought to this vendor a couple times already.. They putting it to a safe package too.. I love the heart box that they using... thumbs up! good job..godbless.. this is my engagement ring got to pairs of wedding bands too for our wedding... ))) <end>  Worth the money  This ring is wonderful it's so affordable I bought it after my fianc&eacute; lost her real engagement ring until we can afford a real nice one and everybody loves it only me and her know it was 10 bucks this is a must have <end>  Very Beautiful Ring  I am so pleased with this ring. The stone seems to be the 'right' size and looks so real. I wear mine with a solid band and it looks like a perfect wedding set.I will buy again from this company. <end>  scratches on day 2  this ring is cheap, so maybe for the price it should be okay to have scratches all over on day 2... <end>  Cute  I bought this ring to use it whenever I went to a place where I ran the risk of being mugged (I live in a 3rd world country so it is fairly common to be mugged right on the street in broad daylight in certain places) so I wouldn't lose my real ring which cost my fianc&eacute; a lot of hard earned money. It looks bigger than it actually is so I was a little disappointed but it does the job, because it looks like a real engagement ring. It looks really cute on my finger, it doesn't scratch up very easily. I'm very satisfied with this product. <end>  Not what seller described.  I'm returning this ring! It is not real sterling silver. Real .925 sterling does not and will not bend and the CZ looks a lot worse than it does online. Very very disappointed. <end>  perfect  I received this ring a week ago and I LOVE IT!!!!! The band is cut in a beautiful way and the stone is not too big to look unreal. I also bought 2 Sterling 2 mm wedding bands and if you do that you will have a beautiful wedding set that is durable and you still feel like a million bucks. Thanks gem avenue for great quality made jewelry. <end>  Gorgeous  I absolutely love this ring! It's a great size, very beautiful and always sparkles! Very nice size, fits just right! <end>  redneckedwoman1961@yahoo.com  i love it.I will wear it a lot it shine ,it sparkles ,its just beauful..i would advice anyone too buy this ring. <end>  Really cute but looks kinda fake!  It arrived on time! I think it looks cute and it sparkles very nice but it looks fake! I mean what can you expect for the price right? But I do wear it and feel comftable with it! <end>  Beautiful  The pictures does it no justice. Its an amazing ring and just the right shine. The stone size is perfect enough not to look like a fake ring. I love this ring. I only wish it came with the wedding band. <end>  Looks awesome  Looks awesome but proposed to my girl and got shot down. Maybe I'll learn not to propose from now on lol. <end>  "the ring"  I bought this ring to wear as an engagement ring. Well, it is crap. It looks so fake and easily bends at the top. <end>  Great!!!!!!  Came very fast, fits finger (runs a tiny bit large) I'm a size 7 and i think a size 6 would fit perfectly. looks great ! <end>  Lovely.  This ring is classy, adorable, and a perfect size. I love how the band gets smaller towards the rock, and you cant even tell its fake! Its perfect, especially for the price. Sturdy too. <end>  This thing made me BLEED  I will say that this is a nice little ring to have around just to wear and feel pretty and girly BUT, two of the prongs on the setting are so badly bent that I have snagged and RUINED (at least in my opinion) a satin comforter (which did not belong to me) and I scratched my leg AND arm with it so badly I bled, both times... So parents beware if you are buying this ring for a younger child/preteen. Just my two cents  ) <end>  Wonderful purchase!  When I first received this item, the box was beaten up pretty badly. I instantly thought to myself, "Dang, I just wasted some money.". When I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised! I bought this ring as a stand-in for an engagement ring, since my fianc&eacute; and I are saving up for an house. He's saving for a ring currently, but it's wonderful until then, and looks incredibly real. The only complaint I have of this ring, is that the edges are indeed sharp. It often snags of fabric, but in my eyes, that's the one flaw of this ring. Wonderful as a gift, stand-in engagement ring, or promise ring.I LOVE IT! &lt;3 <end>  gorgeous  I just got it in the mail and wow its beautiful. I had read the past reviews and decided to order a cheap ring BC I'm recently married and really don't want a expensive ring. But I love it, it looks real and just so gorgeous. Its great for couplesthat want something not expensive and still pretty to have that expensive feel. Or don't have the moneyi. I love it. I recommended this. <end>  more than what i expected  this is the cutest little ring ever! i wasnt expecting much when i bought it, just figured it wasnt much money and if i didnt like it i could send it back. it came in a cute little box with a bow, and i was amazed at how cute it was...so cute...my mom stole it from me  ( <end>  cheap and beautiful ring  I bought this ring because I tend to take rings off and lose them, so I wear this as my engagement ring. That way, when I inevitably lose it, which I have once already, I can just order another one and I don't have to feel bad. This ring is actually really beautiful, people compliment me all the time and I just kinda chuckle inside. <end>  The edges are sharp  I love the ring its not a ring that you would want to wear as an everyday ring the claws that hold the stone in are very sharp and get stuck on things and have scratched me <end>  Perfect, love it, and exactly what I was looking for.  The title sums it up. I could not be happier with my new ring. It is set perfectly and is exactly what I wanted . I like simplicity and this ring fit the bill both in look and price. Thank you Gem Avenue. I could not find a ring like this in the stores I searched at. Princess cut is my favorite. <end>  Get what you pay for  I was quite happy that the ring came in a quite timely manner (I had it 2 days after I ordered it with standard shipping). I read the other reviews before purchasing, and decided that I would take a chance since it was so cheap. The ring alone looks pretty good, but when you put it up against any normal white gold/diamond jewelry, you can tell that it's fake. The CZ stone is set a little uneven, but it's VERY slight and you can't tell unless you're studying the ring. If you want to look like you're engaged for an evening out, or an event, then this ring is a good, inexpensive option. If you're looking for something that can be worn continually that no one would suspect is a fake ring then i'd look elsewhere. Overall though, it's a fun inexpensive ring that by itself looks convincingly like the real deal (as long as no one is studying it up close and personal!) The size runs true-- I wear a size 7, and this ring fits just like any other size 7 that I own. <end>  what I expected for the price  Fits well, doesnt look &#34;too&#34; fake ...It serves the purpose for which it was intended...to keep the truck drivers at my company from flirting with me <end>  So real! I love it!  I love this ring! I'm going to be wearing it for two years until my consecration when I'll wear a 14k yellow gold band.I disagree with the negative reviews.I've been wearing it 24/7 for one month -- including washing my hands, swimming in a chlorinated pool, shower, cutting food, doing dishes, etc.It is fabulous!I've had a few people compliment it thinking it was real! When I took it to the jewelry store to get a little clip for sizing, he looked at it under his magnifier because he thought it was a diamond! My friend said I got a great deal and it looks like a diamond worth 3 thousand!Around 4 weeks in, I did get some tarnish. BUT, NO WORRIES! IT IS NORMAL FOR STERLING SILVER TO TARNISH -- GO BLACK. I just used my white toothpaste and a rough hand cloth with warm water soaked in and polished it away. Good as new!I rarely ever notice an "X" in the stone, I don't totally even notice it close-up. Maybe they fixed it since.It has not scratched my skin or been uncomfortable. The only thing is if I put my face on my hand in bed, it is not comfy.I do get some little bits of fuzz snagged onto the edges of the stone but it's easy to pull off and isn't a hassle. It hasn't snagged on my pantyhose or veil or other clothes or hair.My only complaint is that it's not in half sizes. I'm about 7.5 and so I have to use a sizer adjuster. And it spins to different spots through the day but I think it's because it's still loose fitting. I do recommend getting your finger sized at a jewelry store and if need be, getting a sizer if you are a half size.Thank you for such a beautiful ring at an affordable price! <end>  striking  The ring arrived quickly...I love the set of it...it looks so real no on would ever know its a cz and sterling silver..have recived many compliments on the ring it looks lovely on my finger. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I love this ring. I ordered it on a Friday and received it the following Wednesday. Quick delivery and it came in a cute little box. The ring itself is gorgeous- No one can tell it isn't real. Very delicate and feminine looking- and the stone is a great size! <end>  Princess Cut CZ Ring  What an adorable little ring very shiny and just the right scale. I haven't told anyone I paid under ten bucks for it -- you should see how much they guess I bought it for! haha! Great Value! <end>  Princess silver zirconia ring  It is beautiful!! Much prettier in person than in the picture. Anyone buying this ring, will not be disappointed! <end>  Great ring!  Wow! This ring is great. I had to schedule my engagement pictures and we didn't have my engagement ring in the mail yet, and I really wanted it in the pictures. So I bought this ring because it was the closest thing I could find. It is a GREAT looking ring! So cute! And it fit great. It even came in this cute pink heart box. <end>  Good quality and perfect price!  We needed something that looked nice but didn't cost too much, since I live in a place where I can be robbed at anytime. So, this ring fits just perfect to our needs. It looks pretty real (very elegant) and if it ever gets stolen, we won't feel as bad! <end>  nice starter  This is a nice starter ring. Beautiful cut and nice clarity. Should be sold in a larger size stone. My daughter loved it! Teenagers are not very careful with jewelry. The stone and band have maintained the color and gloss. Good Job. <end>  Beautiful Sterling Silver Ring  Bought as a secondary engagement ring, I was very impressed with this ring. The fit was perfect (sometimes larger rings are either too big or too small). I was highly impressed with the quality of the ring for such a low price. It looks like it costs much more than it did. The CZ is not too big to look fake, and many people have commented on how lucky I am to have such a husband who has good tastes in diamonds! I am also impressed with the band itself. Sometimes, a SS ring is easy to scratch. I have had it for a month and it still looks brand new. <end>  Love my ring  I love my ring, is delicate and pretty... fast shipping! right sizing! very good price! <end>  Fake fake fake  When I got this ring I was so disappointed. It is SO fake looking. If your looking for something that no one will be able to tell is cubic zirconia look somewhere else. Even the metal band was nasty looking. It just looks so cheap. Waste of 15$ don't buy! <end>  a great ring for a cheap, but thoughtful and caring wife.  My wife has ALWAYS hated diamonds and what they stand for. She hates the fact that they cost thousands of dollars and that people die for them every day (and this was before watching blood diamond, I assure you. However, that film did reaffirm her feelings on the issue). However, she loves how the diamonds LOOK! So, she was in a dilemma...that is, until she found this ring. She absolutely loves it. She's always getting compliments from people (it's amazing how people really don't know that it's NOT a real diamond). All in all, she loves it, and that's all that I care about. <end>  def not what I was expecting  This ring is very cheaply made, the band looks as if it will snap. It's off center and the stones not even square. Totally disatisfied. <end>  cheap looking  I got this ring in the mail today and when I opened it I knew it was not for me.The whole ring, band and the stone are much smaller then the picture. Not much shineto the stone either. Looks cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. <end>  Simple  I thougt the ring was gonna be different. Its pretty and really small but not a ring you wear with a band. <end>  Ring  Excellent as the one in image very good and serious store , I reccomend their products <end>  silver engagement ring  nice rin. You need a band cut like it to wear together. Did not work with 3mm band <end>  stunning ring  This ring is a great substitute for a ring I lost. I am wearing this one until I am able to replace the real one. <end>  my daughter loves this ring.  I bought this ring for my daughter and she really loves it. It's a great gift for anyone with a good price.Hi my dad bought this ring for me and I always wanted a really pretty ring and when he gave this to me I was so happy. I never take it off. Thank you dad. <end>  I Like the stone.  Initial disappointment on receipt of the ring. Might be that I had way too much expectations from a ring that I was paying such little for.BUT I must say that as soon as I put it on my finger I was happy that I bought it. The stone looks FABULOUS. It might be too much to say that it could pass off as a real diamond but it sure does look good. The metal could have been made to look better. That is another factor that makes the ring look not so real. An improvement in the craftsmanship of the metal might make the ring look prettier. But on the whole it is definitely a nice buy for such low price. <end>  EXELENT  Package arrived 6 day's after I ordered it, very nice package, perfect conditions. Thank you very much. My wife is going to like it a lot!! <end>  Great Ring  This is a really great ring. The only thing that I can complain about is that the metal of the prongs is discolored. It's gone from the beautiful silver to a copper color. I thought that sterling doesn't have discoloration. Other than changing color, this ring is great.Update  I've been wearing my ring for a while now, and when I first started wearing it I thought it was very durable but now it's really bent out of shape. The whole setting is crooked and bent back. Still looks good just a bit crooked. <end>  Great as a stand in or temporary ring!  I got this ring as a stand in for an engagement ring. I wanted to know what a one carat would feel like and if it would get in the way before committing to the real deal. This ring is pretty and believable. I could see a young lady using this for awhile then getting a better quality one as time went on. The CZ will not pass as a diamond but no CZ will and thats okay! Diamonds are not rare anyway there are millions of them in warehouses and they just keep the price up high. This was a more ethical choice while I search for that special one of kind ring. <end>  Sterling Silver Women's Band Princess Cut Cubic Zirconia Soliaire Ring  I have ordered several jewelry pieces in the past. I have even ordered from The Bradford Exchange and have paid a really high price. I have never been more impressed with a piece of jewelry than I am with my Women's Band Princess Cut Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Ring.From now on I will do all my business through Amazon.com.So thank you again <end>  A pretty good placeholder  The ring is nice for the price. The stone is a very believable size. I didn't get any comments, so I'm not sure if people thought it was real or not, but I don't see why they wouldn't have thought it was real from a few feet away. The setting is not particularly elegant, and does look a little cheap, but that's to be expected for the price. The silver band is good quality and pretty sturdy. I wore the ring for 3 weeks, day and night, just as I do my real e-ring, and it was comfortable and still looked good. This ring was a good substitute while my e-ring was at the jewelers, but I'm glad to have my ring back. It's tough to look down and be satisfied with an imitation when you are used to the real thing. The ring size was very accurate (size 6). Also, a band won't sit flush with the ring because of the stone setting. <end>  5 Stars all the way!!  I was not expecting much when I picked this out. I do not like big flashy rings and this is perfect in size and clarity. It looks real and is perfect for maybe a replacement of your lost one or just to hold things over until a real one can be afforded. I love it and I think it is absolutely beautiful. <end>  Beautiful and totally believable!!!  Just got my ring in today. It is beautiful and you cannot tell that it is not the real thing! It fits perfectly and I love the way the "diamond" rests on my finger. It doesn't sit too high up so I don't think you will have to worry about it catching on things. I am very pleased with my purchase. If you are thinking about ordering this ring, don't hesitate... order it now! You won't be disappointed! <end>  AMAZING REAL LOOKING LOOKING RING  my ring arrived within 4 days which is amazing . It came in the cuteest little red box ,and when i opened it there it was my ring ! . it looked sooo real , im just 15 and wanted a ring , so when i saw this i was like this is perfect ! , but i have to warn yall it looks like an engagement ring , and an expensive one at that . It shines soooooo much , daddy asked if it was real silver or white gold and who much did it cost me , i think that was the best part . lol <end>  I love it!  I am currently stationed overseas and I bent a prong on my wedding band, so I was way to nervous to be wearing that bad boy around. We purchased this as a temporary replacement and we love it. It's simple and nice. I'm very pleased with the ring. <end>  Its cute.  This ring is really cute. I can tell its not real but its still really cute, and if you just glance at it, it does look somewhat real. For the price its worth buying it. <end>  Great deal  I was a little unsure about getting the ring at first, but I'm glad I did because my girlfriend loves it. It is durable and hasn't turned her finger green. It is a great price too. In other words, I am happy I bought it and so is my girlfriend. <end>  TOO SMALL  Way too small, and I really liked the ring, but it squeezed my finger. I would order a size larger if not 2 sizes larger. I already ordered a new one that is more expensive, but hopefully it isn't the same problem. <end>  not what i expected  this ring was not what i expected at all from looking at the photos and reading the previous reviews. the stone is not like the othe cubic zirconias that i have seen. it has this very defined "X" shape in the stone from the way they cut it. the metal is very very cheap. it gets scratched very easy. i guess its a good temp. ring till you can afford a real ring but dont expect anything more than a vending machine quility ring. thats exactly what my bf said when he saw it. <end>  DISSAPOINTED  The ring looked like I got it from a vending machine. Granted it wasn't much, but I still paid to much for it. The picture makes it look great. My ring wasn't even close to looking like this. <end>  Wonderful surprise  My little boy ordered this for me as a surprise for christmas. arrived in a beautiful green box. to quote him, "he was pleasantly surprised" diamond and ring are shinier than some of my Tiffany pieces. Looks exactly as pictured. very pretty. <end>  absolutely amazing  This ring totally went above my expectations. It is beyond shiny and is the perfect size to be absolutely believable. The band looks about 2mm-3mm and is thinner on the sides of the stone vs. around the rest of the ring. The silver is a lighter color vs. a grey/dark grey color and I am very pleased with that. It looks more like a white gold color vs silver.It is a little sharp as others have stated but it is beyond amazing especially for the price you just cannot beat it! I definitely recommend this ring. It's a temporary one until we get my actual ring. I can't say how the stone holds up as I literally just took it out of the box and put it on.The shipping was also very fast. It took a week tops from ordering to delivery VERY pleased and had tracking the whole time.Overall?? Two thumbs way way up. If you're looking for an amazing ring without breaking your bank account this is it ladies and gents! I was hesitant because it was only $10 and was going to dish out $25-$50 but I am so glad I didn't. Can't stress it enough. Amazing amazing amazing! <end>  Just as listed!!  I love this ring! It is very pretty! I was very impressed when I opened the package and it was in a very cute ring box! It was like a suprise even though I already knew what it was!! Wonderful and very fast shipping!! <end>  Loved the ring  I can not exspress how much my mother loved the ring. She cried she loed it so much. Product was top of the line awesome. Thanks again!! <end>  princess cut cubic zerconia solitare  This item was a gift for my mother-in-law. I was very happy with the design, craftsmanship, and the service I received from this seller. My mother-in-law absolutely adores this ring. I have already recommended this seller to others and plan on purchasing more items from them. Excellent service and quality! <end>  Not worth the money. Wouldnt buy this again  Stone fell out 4days of having the ring. i wish that i would of not bought this ring!! it was pretty and i liked the look and style. but its cheap <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I spent lots of time reading reviews on this ring before deciding to go ahead and purchase it, and now I'm really glad that I did. It was exactly what I was looking for and gives the look of a high quality ring at a (much) lower price. I will note that I can see why some people talked about the prongs being a little sharp edged, but it definitely wouldn't discourage me from buying it now that I've had a chance to see if for myself. <end>  like it  The silver has a lot of little imperfections in the sheen and the stone doesn't look real, but for the price it's great. <end>  perfect ring  I love this ring very much. it's the perfect size jewel. the band is skinny and looks food on the finger. I strongly recommend this ring. <end>  Perfect Size and Look  I was very pleased with my ring when it came. It's just as pictured. The only small downfall is that the stone grips are a little bit sharp and can snag or scratch so I wish it was rounded out a bit more but it's not enough to keep me from wearing it. <end>  exactly as advertised  This was the perfect thing! Exactly as ordered and on time. It was perfect for what I needed and wanted. <end>  Beautiful!  It could be an engagement ring!! The stone sparkles like crazy, and could easily pass for a diamond, in my opinion (and that of everyone else to whom I've shown it).It also serves a dual-purpose  I actually wear this ring on my left hand when I go out and want to be left alone by guys. Sneaky but it does the trick, and in style nonetheless! ;-) <end>  very pretty ring  this ring is very pretty. I also bought a 3mm plain wedding band and they go beautifully together. I would recommend this ring. <end>  Love it  I loved this very well done i wear it every day and it never turns my fingers colors very good <end>  Cute  This ring is my temp ring that I wear when cleaning so my real wedding ring wont get damaged.This ring is really pretty. After 2 weeks of wearing it, I started to turn 'colors'... Just wash it with toothpastes (weird I know) and it makes it look brand new and shiny again. <end>  LOVE IT!!!  absolutly gorgeous i wear mine everyday everyone thinks its a real diamond but since its sterling silver its bends very easily. mine fell off my finger and hit the ground and bent but it was fixable <end>  looks are deceiving  this ring looks great online, shipped fast and arrived early. But when opening box, one look and you can tell this isn't sterling silver. It kept it's shine for a week or so but all luster faded immediately. Another get what you pay for. I didn't return or contact seller, I didn't feel like I spent enough to stress on it, but unfortunately I will not be ordering again, sorry <end>  Pretty good ring  I love this ring...im glad i purchased it...besides the easy scratching...the ring is perfect for everyone <end>  poor quality  I bought this ring for my gf. We were very surprised when we find out that this ring was really poor quality. It means not white gold only from some metal and sapphire was really not sapphire but only zircon or something like that. <end>  MUY LINDO Y BELLO  ME ENCANTO ESTE ANILLO, INCLUSO COMPRE DOS UNO PARA MI HIJA, PORQUE ES MUY BELLO Y DELICADO, ADEMAS ES PLATA <end>  RING  The ring looks and fits really good. I'm very pleased to have found it. It works well with my wedding band. <end>  can't wait to get my ring  I want to say that I am really excited about getting my new ring. I can't wait to wear it on my finger. I just hope that it is really silver an not the really cheap bran that turns your finger green.Look forward to also buying more stuff on here too <end>  Sterling Silver Ring  I love how this ring looks but, if you wear it for a long period of time it starts to irritate your finger. The bottom of the diamond is sharp and it sticks into your skin. <end>  beautiful ring  Wore this ring with another band to look like a weddng set but didnt feel the same. Ring is very beautiful thou <end>  ring  I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. I think it is a great ring and very much worth the price. <end>  Looking for a nice cheap promise ring  and thats exactly what I got! if you're like me, and putting off spending the $1,000-$3,000 your girlfriend wants on an engagement ring, this is something nice to get her off your back for a bit ;) <end>  Sterling Silver Womens Band Princess Cut Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Ring Size 8  I Have had this ring for a year and i love it! It has certainly served it's purpose! I am now looking for my Bridal set! I look forward to buying it from the same seller as this ring! <end>  CZ Ring  those of you that say that the ring looks just as real as a diamond need to have your eyes checked. from afar, this will do - but up close, especially after wearing it for 2 weeks, it is noticeably fake. the band has started tarnishing and the CZ is somewhat sparkly but i would compare it to a diamond that is of lower quality--a very cloudy diamond. I have seen other CZ with much better quality and was a little disappointed when this arrived. no "fire" to it. huge disappointment. could have got this at claire's for $5. This will do though, for what i need it to do--keep the "creepers" away when i'm out on the town. <end>  Cute ring - doesn't look real  Got this as a travel band. It looks like a CZ, and do not wear it next to a real diamond or the rock will look like plastic. The small size (~1ct) helps off set the fakeness, and it ends up being a cute ring with a delicate setting. The sizing was accurate (I got a 5), and the ring is very lightweight and unobtrusive.You will not be able to trick your girlfriend into thinking you paid a lot for this ring, but it's a nice item for $10. <end>
 B000KM0VZC  14K Yellow Gold 4-Sided Venetian Box Chain - 18" (1.2 grams) ||	  jewelry is smaller than it looks in a picture!  It would be great if sellers would put a ruler in the picture with their products so buyers can have a better mental picture of the items actual size. <end>  Love it!  This was a wonderful buy. The chain is graceful, classic, and exactly what I needed for my most special pendants. <end>  thin gold chain  I didn't realize how thin it was. I just hope it doest break. this is not one I would recommend for charms <end>  Delicate beauty  Beautiful chain. Delicate, but strong. Clasp is not as tiny as the chain, so it is easy to open. I wear it with a simple gold cross pendant. <end>  Gold Box Chains  I love the quality of the chains, and they were shipped in a timely manner. I would recommend this seller. <end>  We were surprised...  My wife and I were both quite surprised when we received this. It is really, really thin. She is afraid that it would be easily broken if one of the grandkids hooked their fingers in it. It is so thin that it is hard to see the detail that makes it a box chain. It is not easy to judge how jewelry will look from the photo on the computer screen, and will probably stop us from ordering any more over the internet. <end>
 B000KM0VZM  14Kt 4 Sided Venetian Box Chain - 20 inches - 1.3 grams ||	  gold necklace  The picture of the necklace makes it appear much thicker than it was. I know it says it was 1.3 grams, but I am not a jeweler so I relied on the picture. <end>  box chain  not bad for the price ,the closure good be better but remember 35 bucks aint bad <end>
 B000KM0XL4  14K Yellow Gold Gold Frame Agate Cameo Bride & Groom Pendant - 3/4" x 3/4" ||	  Perfect for my friend's Silver Wedding Anniversary!  I have always appreciated well-made cameos; they seem so timeless and romantic. I was looking for a Silver Wedding Anniversary gift for a dear old friend when I came across this collection.I browsed the choices and when I saw this one it was "love at first sight"--just as it had been for my friends when they first met.What appealed to me was the striking blue background color framed by a delicate, yellow gold heart, not to mention the sweet couple gazing adoringly at each other on their wedding day. What struck me most is that this couple even looks like my friends on their wedding day; same long blonde hair as Sharon, same profile as her groom Bob.Needless to say, I purchased it for Sharon and it's her favorite gift. Isn't that awesome? I just wish it had been as easy to buy something of equal sentiment for Bob, but men are always harder, I think.I recommend this highly; the craftsmanship lived up to my expectations.Reviewed by  Betty Dravis, 2008 <end>
 B000KM2OKC  SilverBin Sterling Silver Engagement Style Bypass Style Marquis Cut Ring with Cluster CZ Accents ||	  great  got this for my gf not as an enguagement ring and much to my supprize it was two rings which fit together to make 1. it looked like just one ring in the picture. i must say it is a beautiful ring which always catches peoples attention <end>
 B000KM4D10  14K Yellow Gold Guardian Angel Oval Agate Cameo Pendant - 3/4" x 1/2" ||	  O.k.  Not as pretty nor as detailed as cameos that I have purchased in the past. Rather disappointing. <end>

The clasp can be difficult sometimes but it looks good on  ) <end>  love the necklace  Absolutely love this necklace the only complaint is it's super hard to work the clasp. It was totally worth the money. <end>
 B000KM561Q  Sterling Silver Oval Frame 16x12mm Blue Agate Mother and Baby Cameo Pendant W/18" Chain ||	  Somewhat disappointed  I purchase a LOT of jewelry and have done so for the past decade or more. Quite honestly, I think this pendant and chain are on the lightweight side. Had hoped the combo would arrive a little more substantial. If I had any assurance of finding something similar but more substantial, this would be returned in a heartbeat. Still pondering returning and what else I could do for my expecting step-daughter. <end>  Beautiful necklace, Great Value  This necklace arrived just as it was described. It's very elegant and classy. My girlfriend was really happy when she received it as a gift from our son on his first Christmas. <end>  mother/child necklace  Every mother needs a cameo of their child. It makes a great gift for a new mother. The quality of this product is very good. <end>  Classic and Tasteful  I purchased this piece of jewelry for my mother and I could not be more pleased. It is beautifully crafted and truly stunning. The silver is high quality and the details in the agate are expertly rendered.She was thrilled to receive it and it looks great on her whether she's wearing a nice dress or a blouse. She's had it a few years now, and it still looks as great as ever. <end>  exactly as advertised  Purchased this as a gift for my expecting wife, very simple yet still nice quality. This is no thousand dollar necklace, but, I am OK with that. Nice enough to show I care with out throwing out the budget. Very much worth the $49.00. <end>  Beautiful necklace  I bought this for my kids to give me for Mother's Day, and it is really beautiful. The cameo is really small, but the page on Amazon descibes the size acurately. It is very beautiful, but very delicate. <end>  the picture is perfect but small !!  the picture is 3D with great color but very small. in the site it has the dimentions but I did not notice it. be careful read every thing. <end>  Cameo Review  This vendor shipped promptly. The cameo is beautiful and I would purchase from them again, in fact, I intend to purchase another cameo. <end>  beautiful and timeless  I bought this as a gift for myself (from my five year old...) and I adore it so much, I never take it off. It has a timeless kind of beauty and is a symbol of the unity between my daughter and I. I get compliments on it wherever I go. <end>  BEAUTIFUL  I PURCHASE THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAW. SHE WAS SO PLEASED SHE JUST LOVES THE NECKACE!! THIS WAS A GREAT CHOICE!!MARY <end>  Great mothers day gift  I received this for Mothers Day. It is so sweet. I wear it almost every day. <end>  necklace  The necklace came in the promised time; it looks just like the photo; the quality was what I expected. A pleasant experience all around. <end>  Wonderful item  This cameo is a perfect gift for a new mother. It is beautifully made and appears to be of high quality. I gave it to my daughter to commemorate her child's first birthday and it was a great hit. <end>  Beautiful but it fell apart  My husband gave me this necklace for my first Mother's Day since the birth of my son. Unfortunately, the cameo fell out of it only about 3 months after I recieved it! It's completely lost. I almost cried because it really is a beautiful piece. My suggestion is that if you buy this check it often or perhaps even see if a jewelry shop can reinforce the setting for you. <end>  Blue Agate Mother & Child Cameo Pendant  The perfect gift for a new mother! Item was exactly as pictured and described, and was packaged nicely in a gift box. The agate mother & child was a beautiful blue color with good contrast and nice detail. The sterling silver rope trim around the cameo was also a beautiful touch. Highly recommended! <end>  So disappointed!!!!!!  I purchased this necklace for my daughter, having her first child. Gave it to her at her baby shower on Nov.3. It brought tears,she loved it so much. A month later she had to purchase a new chain for it. Last week the cameo came out of the rim, she barely tried to push it back in and it broke in half. It lasted almost 2 months, not counting the chain. It was something she wanted to keep for a lifetime. So disappointed!!!!! <end>  Sterling Silver Oval Frame 16x12mm Blue Agate Mother and Baby Cameo...  Sterling Silver Oval Frame 16x12mm Blue Agate Mother and Baby Cameo.Shipped fast...It is really beautiful! very nice! Delicate and pretty <end>  Not quite what I thought, but still nice.  It's a bit smaller than I expected. Also, it looks on Amazon like it has a glossy front, but it does not. The engraved image sits on top of the backing. It still looks nice, and my wife is very happy. <end>
 B000KM6F0C  Sterling Silver Satin Shiny Planet Button Earring Earring ||	  Misrepresentation on These  It would have been nice if they SAID THESE ARE CLIP ONS. Who wears clip on's? This was a waste of my time & money and I hope Amazon will refund not only the cost but the shipping also because I never would have bothered if i KNEW THEY WERE CLIP ONS. <end>

Thank you. <end>
 B000KM791Q  14K Gold Frame Agate Cameo Hispanic American Pendant - 3/4" x 1/2" Depicting Mother Holding Child ||	  sad  My husband got this for me as a Mothers day gift. I loved how the Hispanic American Cameo lookd so authentic with amazing attention to detail, from the earrings on the mom, to the expression on the baby's face. However, within 3 months the cameo fell off the holder. I called the company, who replaced it for free, but did not have another Hispanic American cameo. I recieved a regular replacement. I still wear it, and love it, but I am sad that it is not what I origionally ordered. <end>
 B000KM7984  Sterling Silver Oval Frame 16X12mm Blue Agate Mother and Baby Cameo Pendant w/18" Chain ||	  DID NOT ENGRAVE ITEM!  WARNING  I did everything I was supposed to do to order the engraving that they offered, but it arrived today (it is a beautiful necklace, indeed!) but I turned it over and *GASP* my children's names were NOT on there!I almost cried.Don't go to the trouble of paying $5 and doing all the steps, cause they don't pay attention to their orders evidently.I am just so disappointed.UPDATE Amazon refunded a partial discount due to the false advertising of these piece. I am pleased. Would have loved to have the engraving, but the necklace is beautiful and Amazon made it right. I trust Amazon and would purchase this again! <end>  Excellent  My purchase arrived in a very short space of time, it was packaged beautifully, and the necklace was stunning. Thank you <end>  Very nice product.  This was purchased as a gift. The receiver just adored it!!! There were many people in attendance at the event that were giving it rave reviews. <end>  Beautiful  Got this for my mom for Mothers' Day. She loved it so much. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry and I see my mom wear it all the time. <end>  Really Beautiful  I was very pleased when my husband gave this necklace to me as a Mother's Day present. I get a lot of comments on how beautiful and different it is. My daughter looks at it and says, "It's mama and me kissing!" Chain was a very good length, and the detailing is beautiful on the cameo. Wonderful gift. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful!!!  This is the perfect way to celebrate the love of a mother for her child!!! <end>  Stunning Necklace But...  I bought this as a present for myself because it reminds me of the love between a mother and daughter. However, I have had to superglue the cameo back to the frame twice and I havent even had it that long. I love my necklace but I expect a little more if Im paying over $40.00 for a necklace <end>  Beautiful!!!!!!!  When I saw this necklace I knew I had to get it for my sons girlfriend because it looked so much like her and her daughter. I really think that she will LOVE IT. <end>  Gorgeous  This is a beautiful piece of jewelry. It is an excellent gift and price for mother's to be or mother's who simply love being a mom. <end>  Gift...  Someone asked for a Cameo for her Sweet 16. I seen this and knew that this is & was the perfest gift for her.. <end>  blyeskies  Sterling Silver Oval Frame 16X12mm Blue Agate Mother and Baby Cameo Pendant w/18" ChainI purchased this for my wife as a gift.

 B000KMSVQI  Trinity Blood Vultures Cross Necklace ||	  love the chain  this chain looks good and its long like the way i like it i love it alot my friends want one too. <end>  Good but low quality  The style of this necklace is good. The look of it is deffinitly Trinity Blood the only down side to is that is lacks weight. Its nto the heavest thing but its somthing you will want to get if you are a Trinity Blood fan. <end>
 B000KNPWO6  Sterling Silver Tiny Butterfly Stud Earrings 5/16 inch ||	  Perfect Earrings  I bought these because after buying several pairs of gold and one pair of diamond earrings only to have my daughter lose one, I decided not to spend money on earrings. These silver earrings come in the prettiest designs and for the price you can buy several silver earrings for the price of 1 pair of gold. <end>  Cute! Perfect gift.  I bought these for my goddaughter and she likes them. They are very cute. <end>
 B000KOZHJ0  Small Created Tanzanite 10K Yellow Gold Stud Earrings Ladybug Giftbox ||	  Pretty, but they fell apart  I had these for maybe 4 months before the stone fell out of one of them. Of course, not being able to find the stone, I could not have them repaired. <end>
 B000KPFYR4  Earrings 14k White Gold Love Knot ||	  Cute little posts  These were the first earrings I wore after I took out the posts that were used to pierce my ears. They worked out great for me because that are small, lightweight, fairly flat and comfortable. Didn't irritate my ears one bit. <end>
 B000KPN21O  Sterling Silver Tortoise Hoop Earrings ||	  disappointed by the poor quality of this product  - The silver part has a cheap looking. Both poles have rough surface and I could hardly pull the stopper (sorry don't know if this is the correct name; the removable part that you put behind your ear) off the pole.- The tortoise part looks like plastic and has a dim cheap looking. I'm still not sure whether it's real tortoise or not. It doesn't have that nice smoothness and luster that good tortoise has.Also, this product is way bigger than I thought, but that's mistake on my part. I didn't pay much attention to the size.All in all, I would rather pay double the price to get a nicer product, because I don't feel like wearing these at all. I'm going to return them. <end>
 B000KPN520  Sterling Silver Star Earrings ||	  great for a younger person  I love the look of these earrings. I will probably give as a gift to one of my younger nieces.The sale price clinched the purchase for me. <end>
 B000KPPG4A  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Station Necklace - 17" ||	  Nice necklace needs better packaging  The necklace was nice but for the money I think it should have been delivered in a nicer package. I received it in a little plastic bag. This was for a present and I had to go out and get a nice box for the necklace. I also excepted it to be sparkly but it was dull. <end>
 B000KPREBS  14k Gold Amber Sapphire Dachshund Dog Charm ||	  so many beautiful pieces  This seller has so many beautiful pieces to choose from! I'm always satisfied with my Harris Michael purchases so I love to recommend them to friends. I think this piece is exquisite. <end>
 B000KPRN6E  Sterling Silver 36mm Polygon Link Toggle Bracelet 8.5" ||	  Not imapressed  The quality of this bracelet is not very good and the snap is very loose. It gets open all the time. <end>  Jewelry Review  I bought this as a mother's day gift for my mom. She loved it. When I finally flew to see her in NYC, I got to see the bracelet. I was very impressed by it. <end>
 B000KPSVRO  Question Mark Necklace ||	  Question Mark Neckess is questionable  We returned the neckless because we felt that the question mark was much smaller than the picture indicated. The company was good about accepting its return and provided refund in a timely manner. <end>
 B000KPUGUE  Personalized Egyptian Sterling Silver with Gold Cartouche - Open Style ||	  Nice  Arrived on time , well packaged ,i was contacted by Email after ordering the cartouche to specify the letters i wanted to engrave . <end>  Hieroglyphic Pendant  I purchased this pendant for my best friend who is loves Egyptian mythology as well as the TV show, Stargate. I had it personalized with her name and she was absolutely thrilled when she received it. Thanks! <end>  Well worth the money.  This was a birthday gift for my brother Jim. Outstanding quality!! He loved it!! <end>
 B000KPVHHK  Minerva's Ancient Rome Sterling Silver Coin Necklace ||	  Minerva Necklace  The coin is very nice, but the chain is entirely too "fine" to support such a heavy piece. In fact, I have never been able to hook the clasp because it is too small. If you buy this, plan to buy a new chain for it. <end>  Great coin bad chain  The only reason I am giving this four stars is because of the chain, the coin itself it great, I love it. It is the perfect size and goes well with all of my outfits. The chain however broke fairly quickly- thankfully it broke when I was at home and I did not lose the coin. If you buy this you should replace the chain right after you get it. <end>  good  the necklace got me a lot of complements and questions if it was a real coin. i like it but just grew out of it after a while. <end>  Ancient Rome Coin Necklace  Looks great with an every day outfit and was delivered very quickly. I was very satisfied. <end>
 B000KRG336  Fall Mix Freshwater Pearl Sterling Spiral Necklace ||	  I Love This Necklace!  My husband gave me this necklace (at my suggestion) and I always get compliments when I wear it. The colors (teal, dark red, and copper) are striking and the necklace makes any outfit- from jeans to dressy- really special. It is well-crafted and even prettier than it is pictured. I couldn't be more pleased with it. <end>
 B000KRIE5G  Sterling Silver Necklace / Bracelet with Heart Toggle Clasp Key ||	  Very lovely.  I have both size and love them both. However the bracelet will come off easily enough and you may lose it, which I probably have since I just realized I wasn't wearing it. <end>
 B000KRIECY  Sterling Silver Necklace / Bracelet with a Moon Slide ||	  Sterling silver bracelet with moon slide.  If infants could wear jewelry, this would be appropriate. It is so tiny you almost have to use a magnifier to see it. Veru close to invisible. <end>
 B000KSDRZW  Vintage Patina Leaves Nature Oak Leaf Metal Dangle Hook Earrings ||	  Lightweight!  I love the vintage patina, and the squiggle design, but especially how lightweight they are. They could be very thin aluminum or tin..? I might have preferred a more durable material, but as long as you don't wrestle in them, they should be fine. I've had mine a couple of years, & they're in perfect condition.Also, they're much bigger than I expected, 2.5 inches! <end>
 B000KU412I  14K 8X6MM EMERALD CUT BLACK ONXY LEVERBACK EARRINGS ||	  Onyx earrings  Item is just as advertised. Shipping is quick and packaging is very good. I was so impressed that I bought an additional pair of earrings from Augustina Jewelry <end>
 B000KUB25C  14K 7mm Cabochon Green Jade Earring ||	  THE best customer service on the web  This website has excellent quality jewelry.Most of all, however, when I had to make a return, they called me not once(a rarity in on line shopping) but three times to make certain everything wasok and that I understood the process. They were incrediblyl nice, and efficient! <end>
 B000KUMS50  "E" Cubic Zirconia Pendant with a Free Chain ||	  Great purchase!  I love this pendant. It is exactly what I wanted. It was in great condition and shipped very quickly!! <end>
 B000KV3ZKQ  Sterling Silver Blown Glass and Pink Crystal Bracelet 7.5 inch Made with Swarovski Elements ||	  Lovely design  The bracelet looks fabulous, and feels quite more substantial than one would expect from the picture. One drawback, however, is that it is pretty short, and unless one has very slender wrists, it won't fit. The quality is excellent though, and I love the way it looks. <end>  size not true to listing, beautiful bracelet  This the second time I have bought a bracelet, which is not accurate in length as listed. It is a shame that the bracelets didn't fit, as the bracelets are beautiful I was very disapointed! <end>  Stunning!  I purchased this bracelet for my sister-in-law. It looks and feels like a very expensive piece of jewelry. It's very weighty and she loved the way it fit her wrist. The colors are stunning. I'm not sure why it's called Pink Swarovski because it's very multi colored, as in the pic. I'm saving up so I can purchase one for myself. <end>  Beautiful! Just as pictured!  This is a gorgeous bracelet that looks exactly as pictured. The glass beads are very pretty and the Swarovski crystals match the colors in the glass beads. At 7.5", this bracelet fits my 6" wrist perfectly. Nice weight to the bracelet. Reasonable pricing. Highly recommended. Arrived quickly in excellent condition and packaging. Would look nice with the matching earrings. <end>

More importantly, the quality is always high and I've been very satisfied. This ring is amazingly comfortable while still making a statement. The scroll work on the sides is cleanly done, and the citrine's color is clear. I gave this one only four stars because I would have liked the citrine to be a little thicker, but that's really a minor complaint. I will wear this one proudly and often. <end>  Great ring, Looks like the picture  I wanted a ring with my birthstone, and this was the perfect one. The citrine gem is shiny and bright and the silver also catches your eye. The inticate design on the side is symmetrical and done nicely. Overall it's a good ring for the price paid. <end>

 B000KYE6LA  14K Nose Stud w/ Star ES-1979 ||	  Adorable!  I had to re-bend the twist, but I have to do that on every nose screw, so no biggie. Very delicate and pretty, a nice everyday nose pierce. Also, great fast shipping, good packaging! <end>
 B000KZBMT8  Flowergirl Heart Charm Bracelet ||	  Cute bracelet!  I bought these bracelets for my 3 year old flower girls in my wedding. The engraved initial is a nice touch. I would recommend it to others. <end>  Lied to  We ordered this item. A few days later we recieved an e-mail asking if we wanted it personalized. If we did to call a number. We did. The next e-mail in my inbox told me that the item has shipped. I thought I missed out on the personalization. I figuer we could personalize it when it came. After a day or two I get another e-mail that the item is on back order. How can it be on backorder after it ships? I called and cancelled the order. The lady on the phone said they had another simular item. No thanks. A company that lies olr misleads can't be trusted <end>
 B000L3QCQM  18k White Gold or Yellow Gold Floating Open Heart Diamond Pendant ||	  Angel  I bought the 18k white gold floating heart. It is absolutely beautiful and very nice quality. I requested a different length chain when I ordered the necklace and was provided one at no extra charge. The chain is sturdy and has a lobster clasp. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the design of the heart itself. It tends to turn upside down while on the chain, and I can't figure out how to rectify that without having a loop added to the back. I'm not sure if all floating hearts do the same thing. Anyway, I still love it and for now, I just remember to check it periodically to make sure it's hanging properly! <end>
 B000L476D4  Sterling Silver Dancing with Joy Pin ||	  Nice and reasonable  I really liked the pin so much.. I am a teacher and I am thinking of wearing it every time I lecture or having a meeting. <end>

I guarantee he will absolutely love these. Very classy, eye catching cufflinks. <end>  Nice cufflinks  They were so nice it was difficult for me to give them away as gifts!DL <end>
 B000L4L9XW  Photo Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Love it  I love these cuff links. I placed a photo of each of my daughters on each side. I developed them at costco and used the little miniature page they provide to cut out the girls faces. He gets lots of compliments when he wears these. <end>  Perfect  I bought this for my husband's birthday. I put a picture of his mother in one and a picture of his father in the other. He lost both of his parent's and I thought this would be a perfect gift so that he could have them close by. He loved it and now all his siblings want one. <end>  a home run!!!!!!

 B000L4VEBO  14k Yellow 5mm Heart August Birthstone Created Peridot Screw-back Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  VERY DISSAPPOINTED  THESE WERE ORDERED AS A GIFT TO GO WITH A PERIDOT RING. THE COLOR OF THE EARRINGS ARE EMERALD GREEN NOT PERIDOT-GREEN. THE BACKS OF THE EARRINGS NEARLY BROKE OFF TRYING TO TAKE THEM OFF THE CARD - THEY BENT. USED DIFFERENT BACKS FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD NOT COME OFF THE EAR OR WOULD BREAK. THE BACKS ARE NOW BENT AND I AM TERRIBLY LEARY THEY ARE GOING TO BREAK OFF.I DESPERATELY WANTED TO GRAB THE GIFT BACK AND RETURN THEM .. BUT THE SITUATION DIDN'T ALLOW FOR THAT.SO SO SO DISAPPOINTING! DISAPPOINTED AMAZON DOES BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. <end>
 B000L4VHM0  14k Yellow Childrens Butterfly Friction-Back Post Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  So cute  These gold butterfly earrings are precious. I bought them for a seven year old and they may have been just slightly too small for her age. They were really very nice for the price that was paid. Totally recommend. <end>
 B000L4XEJ4  Solid 14k gold Peace Sign Friction-Back Post Earrings - 7mm - JewelryWeb ||	  Great product, great price.  I bought these earrings for my nine year-old niece who is obsessed with peace signs. She just got her ears pierced and they are still quite sensitive, so I wanted a pair of earrings that her ears could tolerate. These are perfect! Just the right size for a child, too. <end>  Earrings are OK for kids  These earrings are a little thin and more delicate than I expected. They will be fine for my ten-year-old daughter, for whom the earrings were purchased, but I was a little disappointed when I opened the box. <end>  Love These Earrings!  I bought these earrings to wear either in my 2nd & 3rd holes, or as a pr when I just wanted something simple & comfortable and they are. They're cute & comfortable & I love them! <end>  Cute But Fragile  These earrings are adorable and the perfect size for a pre-teen. However, I was very surprised/disappointed at how very thin the gold is--almost like wire. They bend quite easily and so require careful handling which I don't think you can always count on from a child! I worry too that the thinness will significantly impact durability. Maybe they're counting on the kid losing them before they come apart. <end>  Earrings broke after only 2 weeks!!!  The backing broke in half after my daughter had only been wearing them for two weeks! Age was devastated because they were a Christmas gift! <end>  My Granddaughter loves them.  9 year olds are into Peace Signs. My granddaughter has to wear 14K gold earrings. These were perfect for the price range for a little girl. Very delicate! <end>  The item is very thin and a broke within days!  The item arrived on time but is very thin and broke after our daughter wore it just a couple of times. We didn't contact the seller because the piece fell and we didn't have much of the earring to send back. In addition, we waited a few weeks to give it to our daughter so by the time it broke the return period expired. Very bummed about this product. <end>
 B000L4XJXA  14k 9x6 mm Briolette Padparadscha-Sapphire Crystal Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  beautiful earrings  I was looking to coordinate with a lab-created padparadscha pendant I had, and love the earrings. The color may be just a tad less red-orange than the necklace, and is more of an orange (but that is what it was described to be, so I am not finding fault.) I don't like things to be overly matchy, so it worked fine and I like the earrings a lot. I haven't worn them yet, but know I'll look fab in them! <end>  Nice jewelery at nice price  Very good piece of jewelery.Only disappointment was it looks mush more orange in the photo, which it is not. <end>  Not quite orange  I purchased these earrings for two reasons; I have a few which are similar with different colored briolettes and I liked the style of those earrings, and I had no padparadscha stones and I wanted that lovely orange color for some jewelry. While the earrings themselves didn't disappoint, the stones were not quite orange. Well, actually they were not at all orange, but were more of a pale pink. The color "orange" could in no way be used to describe the earrings. They did come in a pretty little box "present" box, which I liked. I kept the earrings because I like this particular earring style and didn't have any of the pale pink color that these earrings were. Maybe it is the luck of the draw, but I still wouldn't place another order for these with a padparadscha briolette. <end>
 B000L4ZJUQ  14k Yellow 7x5 mm Emerald-Cut Sapphire-Blue CZ Drop Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Cheap-Looking Ripoff Earrings  Stop! Don't even consider buying these earrings! You do could better at any "dollar store". The gold wires are so thin that you'd better not breathe on them or they will bend or snap in two.The Fleur de lis or whatever it is supposed to be is so thin and sharp it might cut you. The "created" stones are a light phony blue and look nothing even close to real sapphires. The stones do not "hang right" as all of the weight is on the back causing the front to tip up, (which doesn't really matter, I guess, as they are too little to be seen anyhow). They are overpriced by about $68.00. <end>
 B000L4ZJV0  14k Yellow 5 mm Round Orange Created Coral Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  too small  I wanted small earrings but these are so small, and because they are orange, they look like pimples on my ears. Really disappointed. I returned them and will look for a bigger stone. <end>
 B000L4ZK46  Solid 14k 7mm Round Created Blue Turquoise Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  PRETTY & DAINTY  These are a great buy! They are average size turquoise studs that in other stores would cost a whole lot more. They are a great match to turquoise bead necklace I have had for over a year now. (I was looking for just a matching stud.) And, they have a 14kt. post. <end>  Pleased  Ordered these 14K Yellow 7mm round blue turquoise earrings. They were discribed correctly and I was very pleased when I received them. Very nice and true to color and size. <end>  Solid 14k 7mm Round Created blue Turquoise Earrings  I received the earrings and they are beautiful. The color is perfect for what I needed. They fit nice and look pretty in my ears. I like them so much that I will be getting more earrings from this seller. It is a great place to do business with. <end>  Very Disappointed  Wow, what a disappointment. I must have paid $34 for the gold posts and backs because the turquoise balls look like they are worth 50 cents. They look like cheap blue plastic balls. I don't see how anyone could rate this anything above a one star. <end>  Sunny Californian  The earrings are as described, vivid in color and a nice size. The only negative to report is the backs are very flimsy and I replace them as I almost lost one earring the first time I wore them. Otherwise, I highly recommend them, I have received many compliments on them. <end>  Just OK  The earrings look just like the photo. I think I expected the turquoise to look more authentic. I purchased for my daughter who is allergic to silver earrings, so I will go ahead and give them to her anyway (and not return), but I don't think these are really that great. <end>
 B000L514N6  14k White 9 mm Round CZ Friction-Back Post Stud Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Earrings  I was very disappointed with the earrings because they did not look very authentic. I returned them the same day I received them. <end>
 B000L51AP8  14k Yellow 5 mm Heart Peridot-Green CZ Drop Earrings - JewelryWeb ||	  Peridot Lever Back earrings  I ordered these earrings for a friend for her birthday knowing she would love them. She certainly did and they look lovely in her ears. I did expect the earrings to be a bit heavier for the money but they were good.[...] <end>
 B000L5X4JS  Genuine Green Turquoise Triangles and Blue Lapis Lazuli Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Love these earrings, now am looking for a green turquoise pendant to wear them with (hint-hint, Silver Insanity!)

 B000L6IOTW  Pink Sapphire Earrings W/ Diamond 10K Gold Ladies Studs ||	  Gorgeous  I thought about these for over a month before finally ordering them. From the description and the picture, I thought they would be HUGE. They are not. They are the perfect size and the picture does not do justice to the beuatiful hot pink color (my favorite). <end>
 B000L7PQGK  August Peridot Gold Czech Crystal Butterfly Birthstone Butterfly Italian Charm Bracelet Link ||	  love this charm  This is absolutely one of my favorite Italian charms. It is so dainty and pretty! I also love the little jewels on the butterfly's wing! <end>
 B000L7RETC  September Sapphire Gold Czech Crystal Butterfly Birthstone Butterfly Italian Charm Bracelet Link ||	  Butterfly Charm  It is quite pretty, but the stones come out in short order with normal use. I bought this and the starter bracelet together. Once I figured out how to put it on there, which takes some figuring, it looked cute enough. Unfortunately, not as big as it looks either. I wouldn't buy it again <end>
 B000L81UVY  Saint Christopher,sterling Silver Us Protect Us Pendant,20" Steel Necklace Chain ||	  Not what I expected.  Smaller than I expected it to be, and very dull for silver. I put it in jewelry cleaner and polished it out to a better shine. Other than that, the metal stamp was without complaint, as you can clearly see the front and the Navy logo on the back. <end>

 B000L9I7VO  Crystal Pineapple Pendant in 14K Yellow Gold - Small ||	  Purchased aboard Golden Princess...  I purchased this small pineapple pendant from the boutique aboard the Golden Princess on a recent trip to Hawaii. There is no chain with this pendant, but the pendant itself is beautiful. The crystal sparkles and shines with many colors. I also bought the larger pendant. The pineapple is the symbol of hospitality, and this would make a great gift for a mother or wife or sister who loves to entertain. <end>
 B000L9KFLO  Plumeria Earrings in 14K Rose Gold - 7mm ||	  Gorgeous!  These earrings are so much prettier in person. The pictures here don't do them any justice. They have a beautiful brushed finish with a "diamond" cut on each petal that gives them some sparkle. If you are new to rose gold like I am these are the perfect item to get you started. I'm hooked! I will definitely be purchasing from Amazon/Maui Divers Jewelry again. <end>

 B000LB8UYG  Flowering Tree of Life Religious Symbol Filigree Sterling Silver Oval Hook Earrings ||	  Even better in person  I saw these online and thought they looked like a cute, inexpensive gift to give to my sister. Considering the price, they look even better in person. Not cheap looking. You cannot tell from the picture, but they are actually see through (the design is not set against a metal backing like i originally thought when ordering them). I think they're great, especially considering the price. <end>  Gorgeous!  They are just the right size. I love practically all of Silver Insanity jewelry and the quality of what you buy is well worth the price you might pay. I wear this almost all the time, they go with everything. Love them! <end>  Good looking earrings for a great price  Negatives They are somewhat the large side if your main squeeze (or you) prefer small earrings.Positives Sterling silver. Quality made. Great price. Good looking jewlery.Recommend it?Yes. The tree of life is spread throughout many cultures and can be adapted to your own philosophy or religion(it doesn't have to be just a "Celtic" thing). My wife loves these earrings and wears them often. <end>  Beautiful detail  Great craftmanship! Detail is incredible. Bought them for my Mother and she loved them! <end>  Mom loves these!  My mom is into Celtic stuff. So, I got her these for Mothers' Day. She loves them! <end>

A great addition for any lover of Celtic jewelry. <end>  Gorgeous!  I received these earrings as a gift and they're even more beautiful in person. Furthermore, they are well-priced for the quality. <end>
 B000LBBWGY  Small Filigree Puffed 3D Dangling Heart Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Very pretty - suitable for anyone  I bought eight pair for my sisters and neices for a special occasion who range in age from 23 to 55. They ALL loved them! The earrings are small but also delicate, very pretty and look much more expensive than the price. They are light and comfortable enough to wear everyday. We couldn't be happier with them. Silver Insanity has quality items and ships them to you quickly. <end>  Pretty  Got these as a Christmas present (I picked them). I love all products from Silver Insanity. These earrings are simple, feminine and sturdy for such small pieces (slightly larger than the head of a thumb tack). Excellent buy if you like this style; ideal for any kind of outfit - work, formal, or everyday wear. <end>  Awesome  I love these. They are the perfect thing to dress up casual. Not too flashy but a little bigger than I expected. Worthwhile purchase. <end>  petite and pretty  these earrings are very pretty. they are well made and sturdy. i bought them for my youngest stepdaughter and they were the perfect size. she's 9 but looks like she's 6 or 7. the only suggestion i would make is to go out and get some earwire backs (the little rubber bumpers that you put on earwires to keep them secure in your ear) as these have a tendancy to try to walk out of your ears. they are just too light weight to stay in properly. once you do that, they're perfect. <end>
 B000LCS9OQ  Simmons Jewelry Co. Men's 0.11 Cttw White Diamond Cross Pendant Necklace ||	  A nice heavy piece, shines in the light!  I was looking for another vendor beside Macy's on Amazon to buy this piece. I ended up getting it at KJ at my local mall. This gothic cross design has a mirror backdrop with a brushed stainless steel matte finish on the second level of the cross. The very top cross has some diamonds place within the design. On the back of the cross, it has an large S in old English font, which works out well for me since S is in my name.I looked at the other designs and this Gothic cross design was the best. It is really heavy and people will come up to you and ask can I feel it. The mirror stainless finish makes it shine. The diamonds are also bright in the sun and store department lights.The warranty on this piece is lifetime, all you have to do is have it looked at by a jeweler who is licensed to sell Russell Simmons Stainless jewerly.One word of advice on this piece. It is mirror finished Stainless, so it will and shows scratches. If you use an stainless shine cloth with a cleaner you can null and shine past those scratches. <end>

 B000LN8N8C  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Four Point North Star with Genuine Rainbow Moonstone Drop 17" Adjustable Necklace ||	  sterling silver celtcic necklace  It arrived safely! (I stay in South Africa)It looks beautiful, detailed, the stone is good quality, necklace fits the design and it is the size I expected.If you look at the picture, you will see the silver around the knot is slightly dark/blackish/unpolished. Mine is not, but I guess it will start looking more aged as the years go by, it looks shiny, small and glitters in the light. Absolutely beautiful. <end>  Very nice piece  This is a lovely necklace, my only complaint would be a slight impurity in the gem that hangs down. But I love the necklace, nice quality and a great value. <end>  a date to remember  On our first anniversary my now husband & i both had pneumonia. Sitting across from each other with red noses, and tissues my amazing fiancee surprised me with this beautiful necklace, totally surprised me. It holds special meaning. I have worn it every single day for four months including on our wedding day. It goes great with everything from casual to dressy, good quality, and a beautiful necklace from an amazing thoughtful man. <end>  My wife Loves it  This was a gift for My wife and she Loves it .great Celtic design and Nice chain <end>  Wife liked it  Bought as a gift. Wife really likes it, therefore, so do I. Quality is average to slightly above average. <end>  Stunning  What a beautiful necklace!! Geat design and the length is adjustable.

 B000LS3S1O  14K White Gold Men's & Women's Wedding Bands 6mm comfort-fit ||	  Excellent  This ring is excellent. It is heavy and looks expensive and good quality. My husband loved it. They also offer free engraving and customer service is great and friendly. I had to exchange the ring for a smaller size, the return proccess was quick and easy. Definately will purchase more rings from IWB. <end>  Pretty, but scratches easily  We really like the shape, size, and style of this ring, and how shiny it was--at first. I've been wearing it for less than a month, and it already has numerous notable scratches all over it. We were not expecting it to be so easily damaged at this level of gold count. <end>
 B000LTDXT0  Sterling Silver 7mm Wide Green Jade Four Section 2.5 inch Bangle Bracelet With Push Button Clasp ||	  attractive sterling silver green jade bracelet  For the inexpensive price this is a great casual jade bracelet. Very comfortable to wear and is really attractive. I have received many compliments. The clasp opens a little too easy after many wears but the bracelet will not fall off. For an everyday casual inexpensive jewelry I can't complain. I wear it every day in a chemistry lab, so I did not want to purchase something too expensive. I just love <end>
 B000LVAHBK  10K White Gold Men's & Women's Wedding Bands 5mm comfort-fit ||	  Wedding band scratches  When I first received this ring it was beautiful. It stayed shiny for about a month. Now 3 months later, is covered in scratches and no longer shiny. I ended up buying a sterling silver ring for much less money, and it is still scratch free after a month of wear. I was under the impression that 10k gold would not scratch as easily as 14k or 18k. Guess not. I would not recommend this ring, especially for the expense. <end>
 B000LVC1Y6  10K White Gold Men's & Women's Wedding Bands 4mm comfort-fit ||	  Good priced ring  If you want a plain but nice looking, comfortable ring this is it. I do not need anything else for a wedding ring. Hate luxurious things. <end>
 B000LVTJ9Q  Sterling Silver Swarovski Crystal Star Pendant ||	  Purple Star Pendant  I couldn't be more happy with how this product looks! It's a beautiful purple color and it shines very nice in the sunlight. It's a great price for such a wonderful product! <end>  Purple Star  This pendant is beautiful; it looks blue-purple in the picture, but it is very, very purple. Think of your purple Crayola crayon! The color saturation is deep enough that it can be worn with almost any color and not "disappear" against your shirt/blouse/sweater like the pale pink one does. I love that the jump ring is sterling, not that silver-plated base metal garbage. It does tend to get dirty quickly, but I've noticed that if I take a sponge or face cloth with just a tiny dab of dishwashing liquid and give it gentle rub all over under running water, it looks brand-new and sparkles again. <end>  A Lovely Little Star  ...A beautiful, vivid charm! I was very impressed with the clarity, color and quality, particularly for the reasonable price. At an ample size and a noticeable sparkle, this star is a great addition to any wardrobe, day or evening, casual or formal. There is small internal signature found just below the jump ring. The violet is lovely, and at the average price, I certainly expect to collect a few other colors! Works well on a chain, chord or ribbon. <end>

I am very pleased with what I got and I don't know how much can be said about the ring itself. It is shiny and thin prefect for a females hands. I wouldn't put it on a man , a bit too Dainty, Go for the wider ones for a dude. <end>  Nice ring. Great price. iweddingband delivered on time for Christmas.  I made a last-minute decision to get this and ordered with expidited shiping. They promised delivery on December 24, and I recieved the ring on Dec. 23.My wife is a nurse and can't wear her diamond wedding ring to work, but likes to have a band. She lost the band I got her on our 1st Christmas when we moved to our new house. So, I was hoping that this ring would look nice.My wife was more than happy with the looks. It is simple but pretty, and we are very happy with the purchase. <end>  Well Pleased  I am well pleased with my ring. It was prompt and in good condition when I received. It actually looked like what I saw when I ordered. <end>  Ring  My husband is a banquet server, he has to move tables around constantly. This ring has held up through it all. No bending or mishaping. Some wear, but no more than usual. Comfortable fit, simple. <end>  Just Perfect  My engagement ring had a wide band so I needed a slim comfortable band to go with it. My husband found this one, it looks amazing with my engagment ring and without it! It is so comfortable! <end>  Pretty, but scratches easily  Beautiful plain wedding band that works well if you want something simple for everyday or for traveling. It is quite flat, so would work well if you are in a job where you work with your hands a lot. Because it is 10K gold, it scratches easily and doesn't stay as shiny as some of the higher karats, but still a nice ring. And well worth the price! <end>  Great Purchase  I bought this ring for a thumb ring. It's pretty and it's comfortable. It costs a little more than I'd hoped, but it was better priced than other offers that I saw. <end>

 B000M029SE  Sterling Silver Round Shaped Citrine Gemstone Polished Finished Band Ring Size 8 ||	  disapointed  when i first get this ring is looked great. Then the citrine started to fade.It now looks like clear glass with a little color. I was heart broken.I will send it back. <end>
 B000M4IJOI  14k Gold Overlay Brass Twist Link Chain Bracelet ||	  terrible and too thin.  I bought this bracelet for my boyfriend. He loved it, but that didn't last long because after just a few wears, it was so scratched up and dull looking it looked terrible. The gold overlay is just way too thin. <end>  Delicate tristed strength  Very, very nice and well worth the price!!! I would and did order more of the same for myself or as gifts. Arrived very quickly. <end>  14k gold bracelet  The Bracelet was nice its good enough to give someone a gift there was one thing missing there was no hook on the Bracelet. <end>  gold overlay way too thin  I bought this bracelet for my boyfriend. He loved it, but that didn't last long because after just a few wears, it was so scratched up and dull looking it looked terrible. The gold overlay is just way too thin. <end>  Two small  What is the old saying, you get what you pay for. This bracelet is too small and cheap looking. This is good for a little girl about six or seven years old. <end>  Totally worth it  I bought this bracelet, I must admit it was smaller that I expected. But it comfortable,easy to wear and shows no signs of fading so far. It's perfect for children because of the size. But it's great for adults as well (as long as you have a small wrist.... lol) <end>  great bracelet  I got really quick. less then a week. It surprised me cause it was just before just before christmas and I didn't think it would get here before the new year but it came 2 days before christmas. The best thing is that I can wear it and I am really sensitive to anything that isn't real and this is my first time wearing anything thats overlay but happy to say no problems wearing it. <end>  14K Gold Brass with decent price  I got this bracelet for a gift and was very good, delivery was ok, quality is ok.Looks good and the price is excellent. <end>  it's too small  It looks like in the picture, but it's too small for a woman, so I think that the seller has to recomend it for girls. <end>  Good product  As said in the add, runs a little small though. I would say it fits a medium rist. Came on time in a nice jewlry bag. <end>  Nice  These are bridesmaids gifts. I am hoping that they will hold up how they look upon arrival. I think they are good quality. <end>  Re  Great gifts  I really like the bracelet it will make a nice gift. I have granddaughters that have birthdays in March. This wll be their gifts. <end>  love it  i love to see my girlfriend wear this stuff, she told my her friends love it, and she is very happy with it. <end>  gold overlay is just way too thin.  I bought this bracelet for my boyfriend. He loved it, but that didn't last long because after just a few wears, it was so scratched up and dull looking it looked terrible. The gold overlay is just way too thin. <end>  Nice bracelet  It came a day early from what the receipt said. Fits perfect on my wrist buy first glance it is kinda small. For only 1.99 I thought it would have tarnished by now but ive had it on for about a week in the shower and everything and it still shines like brand new!! Great buy!! <end>  LOVED IT  Great they shipped really fast and it made my girlfriend really happy yo. i recommend its pretty cool didnt have to worry about anything. <end>  14k Gold Overlay  This was a little present for me. I love it. It was on time. This was exactly the company offered <end>  Good so far  I have not worn this yet but it looks really nice. It is made really well, not cheep looking. I would buy this again. <end>  very dainty  i luv it! it brass and the price for it is awesome, i get it wet in water and it still is holding up well thankx.NICE! <end>  disappointed  Bracelet is small like other reviews have said. That was one of the reasons I bought it though as I have a small wrist. While the fit is fine for me, the color is not. It looks like a very cheap bracelet which it is but I expected more especially with some of the reviews that I had read about it. Oh well, you get what you pay for. Not worth sending back. <end>  Today is 10th November  HelloToday is 10th November but i still did not received the goods. <end>  Too small  I think I have an average size wrist, but at 6 3/4", this bracelet is too small for my wrist. I can't get the ends of the clasp together enough to catch. This is best for a child. <end>  Beautiful bracelets...  This is a beautiful bracelet. I bought 3 at the same time and they are still going strong after a whole month! I forgot about one on the side of the tub and it laid in water for over 4 days and no oxidation occured. Quite Amazing! <end>  Best Value  I paid less than a dollar for this item. It's real, I checked it. Best value ever. <end>  I'm pretty happy with it.  I bought 2 and gave one to my mother-in-law and going to give one to her mother. Now I think I'll get a third for great grandma. My only criticism would be that I'd like the chain to be just a little longer for easier clasping when no one else is around to help. <end>  just beautiful  It is cute, But is not real gold... is small but fits pretty well, am sure you will like it. <end>  Gold Bracelet  Gold Bracelet was delivered to me in plastic bag in pieces, hopefully it wont be a hassel to get a new one. <end>  Just one complaint  This bracelet looks nice and is made pretty well. It has held up and the clasp stays closed. I have to admit though, I haven't worn it as often as I would, because the chain tends to pull the little hairs on my arm (ouch). And I'm not even a hairy person! ;) <end>  I love it  Small,yes but for the prize,u'd not regret buying it one bit. I love it cos its gold and it suits my dressing... Trust me,its really nice. Arrived quick and it's worth the wait! <end>  Great Bracelet!  This bracelet looks like real gold without the price tag to go along with it! It's supposedly brass under the gold plate which means it will still look like gold when the other wears off! Great buy and I would recommend this product to anyone. <end>  bracelet  I recived the package three days early which made me very happy. I ordered this as a gift for my grandmother to give to her on Christmas. At first I thought that it was to small, but then I tried it on my mother and it fit fine. I am also very happy that it came inside of a cute little white draw bag, so I don't even have to wrap it! <end>
 B000M8O1WI  Solid Sterling Silver Puzzle Pieces Ring Please specify size  8 ||	  Puzzle Ring  Ring arrived in great condition. It's very beautiful and arrived when needed.

 B000M9IZFQ  Snowflake Holiday Gift Necklace ||	  Very nice sparkle  Very pretty with lots of sparkle, but MUCH larger than I expected. That may not be a bad thing for some who like large pendants. I was expecting something smaller and more delicate. <end>  Sparkly!  This snowflake pendant is very pretty. I am complemanted on it every time I wear it! The chain is adjustable, so you can make it the perfect length. The snowflake itself is rather large, about the size of a quarter, and very eye-catching. Perfect for the snow bunny on your list! <end>

 B000M9JEJ2  Solid Sterling Silver Large Cat Pendant ||	  Just......okay......  When I first received this item, I was dissapointed, it was small(about an inch) and looked cheapy cheapy. The silver was really thin and it had bent slightly during shipping. I had bought it as a present for my wife, and she actually loved it because it was so unique. So, credit where credit is due, "it's unique," although it's not the greatest quality and kinda britle looking. <end>
 B000M9LDUK  Solid Sterling Silver Angel Light Ring Please specify size  9 ||	  Second Review for Angel Light Ring  I reviewed this item shortly I received it, and was disappointed because chemicals in the pool seemed to turn the Angel ring black... Well, I must say that after some time, the "black" disappeared and the ring is once again as beautiful as it was when I received it. I wear it all the time, but not in the pool! <end>

 B000M9MS2W  Solid Sterling Silver Pink Mother of Pearl Ring Please specify size  6 ||	  Too Small  This ring is pretty but smaller than I expected it to be. The vendor should include dimensions. I won't buy jewelry online again unless the size/length of an item is indicated. This is the second time I've given the same review of this product. Don't know what happened to the first. <end>
 B000M9MXY0  Solid Sterling Silver Turquoise Ring Please specify size  6 ||	  review of solid sterling silver turquoise ring  This is a beautiful ring. It does tend to run a little large. I ordered a size 5 and it feels more like a 6. I'll just have a jeweler add a ring guard and it will be great. <end>  beautiful  This ring looks just as it appears, except the turquoise is actually a little bit brighter than in the picture. My wife loved it! <end>

 B000M9SJ16  Bold Sold Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia & Onyx Rhodium Plated Men's Ring Please specify size  9 ||	  Ring not so impressive  The ring looks a little off--something with the metallic work. It's light in weight and the black onyx is not very shiny. I'd recommend you check around jewelry stores for rings that you like, since buying something that's going to be around your finger should be a perfect fit -- in size and in style. It's too hard to find on the Internet, I think. <end>  Nice Ring  I bought this ring for my fiance and he wears it daily, he really seems to enjoy the ring. Its not to flashy! <end>

Shipping was prompt and arrived a day before the expected date. This was a great company and I would be happy to do business with them in the future. <end>  Horrible Service  Well, I would like to rate my purchase but I have yet to receive it. After several attempts to find out when I may receive the ring that I ordered on March 11, 2007, I still have had NO answers. I have never been so disgusted with customer service as I am right now. If I ever receive my ring, I will rate it!!!!Terrible...that about sums it up!!!!! <end>

 B000MF65XE  14k White Gold Journey Curve Pendant (1 1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I1 Clarity) ||	  My Best purchase of 2010!!!  I bought14k White Gold Journey Curve Pendant (1 1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I1 Clarity)while it went on sale .I was a bit hesitant to buy online for the price and mid range quality diamonds without seeing it but the diamonds looks fine to me (naked eye) does sparkle and seeing the price of 2369.99 now I feel did a great bargain.The look of the image is not same when i received , It does looks how other 7 stone Journey Diamond pendants looks and yes its S shaped, just search "journey diamond Pendants " in amazon.The packaging was not a great one considering price paid but is just a decent package and can't blame much.If this goes on sale , just go and buy !. <end>
 B000MFC5WE  Beautiful! Sterling-silver Rounded Cross with Italian Box-chain ||	  Very beautiful  This is a very beautiful chain and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who'd like a silver cross. Just remember to get a chain that's long enough for your neck. <end>  Read specs  I did not read the specs on the size of cross. I can't remember now, if it was even provided. But, when the cross arrived, it was HUGE, much larger than what I wanted. This was a gift for my mom and I knew what size of a cross she wanted. Know what exactly what you are ordering. But, it was good quality and I kept that cross for myself and will use in on another chain.  ) <end>  Quality Jewelry  This cross is simple, beautiful, and elegant. The chain it comes with is also attractive, and is not linked so loosely that it tangles constantly, though as it is a thinner chain one should treat it with care to avoid breaking it. The cross' size is small and rounded enough to seem feminine, to me, but perhaps that is only because I see my wife wearing and loving it. I can highly recommend this piece. <end>  pleased  I was very happy with this product when I received it. It was just as it was described in the label. I am very happy with it and wear it all the time. Thank You. <end>  great  i have looked at the item over and over and then i ordered it.no dissapointments with product,shipped quickly.very nice item! thanks <end>
 B000MFF88C  Sterling Silver Elephant Charm ||	  Sterling Silver Elephant Charm  The charm is very nice and small. I liked it myself but was bought for my daughter. She wanted STERLING "SILVER" it has a goldest tint which may be caused by the red stones, I don't know. But for her; she was not happy cause it just didn't look good on her Sterling Silver bracelet. I sent it back and ordered 2 others (Heart & Cross). She very happy now.If you aren't as picky as she, the Elephant is very lovely and I myself would have kept it if it had been for me. It's small & dainty just right for a girl who likes elephants or is a 'BAMA' fan. Has a good split ring on it to hook to bracelet which also is a plus..As for me I would rate it a four but since it was for my daughter I asked her to rate it, Sorry, she gave it a 3; Just ok. <end>  As advertised; would order again from this source  Was a gift for granddaughter and she loved it. Call this choice a "success." Want to ID her as a Republican early in life! <end>
 B000MFIFLO  Sterling Silver Marcasite Figure Eight Necklace ||	  Chain arrangment doesn't work  This piece does look better than the photos and was larger than expected. However, the Figure Eight piece doesn't have a place for the chain, so the chain is simply wrapped around the Figure Eight itself. This shortens the chain and means that there is no "give" in the chain itself. I plan on keeping the piece, but taking it to a jeweler to see if something can be added so that the chain works. Unfortunately, now that I look at the photo closely I can see it. <end>  A little flashy  Like others have mentioned, the way that the chain loops around the pendant is less than ideal. The pendant flips over a lot more than I would hope for. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it though. The length is perfect for a v neck or scoop neck blouse. I think it will grow on me over time but if I had seen it in the store I don't think I would have purchased it. It's a little flashier than I was expecting. <end>  Beautiful Necklace!  I purchased this as one of my daily Quick Pick deals and I was surprised at how much nicer it was than I think it's given credit for. The only negative I have about this is the chain, BUT not about the arrangement or how it lays, only about it being too fine for a pendant this large. If you take a close look at the picture you can see how the chain is looped around the pendant, this solves all the problems I thought I might have. I am expecting the matching earrings to arrive today and I can't wait to wear them out! <end>  Marcasite figure eight necklace and earrings  I gave the earrings and necklace, sight unseen, as a gift, and they were very well received. I was sent a photo with my friend wearing them, and they are a good size and look nice.The necklace would be nicer with a proper chain fixture on the back of the figure eight. <end>  Review for Sterling Silver Marcasite Figure Eight Necklace  This necklace looks much better in person then it does online, and the size is just right! It really looks good on an omega if you have one. You can dress it up, or dress it down depending on what you are wearing. <end>  Stunning Necklace - Be Prepared for Tons of Compliments  I absolutely love this necklace. I literally had dozens of compliments when I wore it to work with the matching earrings. It's on an 18" chain so I disagree with the other reviewer who says there isn't enough give. It is well made, well packaged & just stunning. The earrings are a must have if you buy the necklace! <end>
 B000MFIFO6  Sterling Silver Butterfly Earrings ||	  Small but nice  I gave these to my Aunt on Xmas and she likes them alot. They are very small..like stud small, but they are still very nice. <end>  Very small  I think these earrings are pretty but they are very small. If the wearer doesn't have short hair, it will be hard to see them. <end>  Butterflies  The product came in a timely fashion, and was greatly appreciated by the recipient.It is a fine, delicate piece of jewelry. <end>  Sterling Silver Butterfly Earrings  I loved the packaging of this item. The box was big enough that no one could tell I was receiving jewelry. They were placed in a small, black bag, completely protected from any damage. I loved them when I finally opened the bag, and couldn't wait to wear them. I was immediately given complements at work about my new earrings. <end>  Nothing like the color in the picture  I purchased these earrings for my daughter for Christmas. The yellow citrine is her birthstone. The earrings look darling in the picture, but the earrings I received look nothing like the picture. They are so pale you can hardly call them yellow. Too much of a hassle to send them back, so I guess she is stuck with them. <end>  Deceptive size  Much smaller than the display on amazon deceptive display of merchandise I would have been happy to pay more and receive a nice piece of jewelry <end>  they're not matching colors???  I bought these earings for a sister in law for Christmas, and it being only a week away from Christmas, I won't be able to return these on time to get the right pair on time! Very incovienent. I bought these butterfly pair of earings and one butterfly is a dark purple as the other one is a baby purple. Major difference. I will be returing this item. <end>  bad color  these earrings are supposed to be garnet and are actually more of a wine color. were to be a gift for g-daughter. i bought 8 g-daughters birthstone earrings. imagine when this one gets her pair. they are pretty but not as described. they are not garnet. <end>  minature  I was disappointed because the photos you see give the appearance that the item is much bigger and brighter than reality. <end>  Just what I wanted  I ordered these earrings because my dad loved the color purple, and butterflies. The earrings are perfect and I plan to orders many additional pairs for our family to wear and honor him. <end>  Nice equipment  Verry good deal, I choose this rating because those were cheap than other of the same size. Off course I will recomend it <end>  Garnets earrings  The garnet butterfly earrings are very well made and very pretty. I thought the earrings would be slightly larger but this size is better for me.the silver is well crafted. <end>  Love them!  Exactly as described and a great value. Beautiful!Would also make a great gift, altho I got these for me! <end>  Sterling silver gemstone earrings  These earrings are beautiful and wee woth the price. I may get a pair in another coloras a gift for my friend. <end>  Amethyst earrings  Beautiful stones & perfect size earrings. I would highly recommend them to anyone that loves butterflies like I do! Nice piece of jewelry. <end>  Smaller than appears  I bought these earrings for my daughter-in-law for her birthday. They are beautiful, but they are smaller than I expected. <end>  beautiful!  my husband bought these for me on our 2nd dating anniversary 3 years ago when i was 17. They were the most beautiful earrings I've ever had and ever seen. They are simply beautiful! i was kind of careless with my jewelry when i was a teen and accidentally vacuumed these up and broke them. Ive wanted him to get me another pair ever since, but he says ill break them again! If you are looking for a great gifts for someone you love or for yourself these are them!! you wil not regret, thhey look just like the picture, but better. <end>  Cute butterflies  IPefect for a tween with newly pierced ears. Perfect that her birthstone was availble too. ps Delaney loves them too! <end>  Amatist Butterfy Gem Earrings  Earrings are a little smaller than I expected, but color and styling very pretty. I Will give as a gift. <end>  Butterfly earrings  Just beautiful. The craftsmanship is ..is ..so lovely. Adult or young lady this set is just right. Not to heavy I got the bow earrings to compliment these. I wear both sets all the time. Oh, so shiny. I receive lots of notice about them. I tell people check out Amazon great product great prices. <end>  As Advertised  What it says is what it is. My mother loves them. Beautiful, deep purple. If you like the photo, you'll like the earrings. <end>  Beautiful!  These are smaller but much more beautiful than pictured. They are gorgeous pieces of real jewelry -- highly recommended! <end>  Lovely Earrings  I bought these earrings as a gift and could not be happier with the earrings themselves. They are exactly as described. Yes the picture is bigger; perhaps if people learned to read they wouldn't be disappointed with the size. I think they are a good size for earrings. The necklace would be too small for an adult. The amethysts are a lovely purple color. Just wish the presentation could be better than a bag. A small box would be nice. Presentation is the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. <end>  Not as nice as the picture  I was disappointed to find the the stones in the earings I received were nowhere as nice as the picture. My stones are very pale as opposed to the deep rich stones advertised in the picture. I feel this was very misleading. <end>  prettty as a picture  Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earringsthese are the cutest earrings. they are a little small, but they a beautiful! they're perfect for a second or third hole in your ear. I have worn them in all 3 of the holes in my ears. <end>  Looks just like the picture  I bought these because it is my birth stone. I really like them because it is hard to find inexpensive earrings that do not irritate my ears. I have worn them for 5 days without taking them off and my ears feel find. I would recommend these for kids and adults. <end>  STERLING SILVER AMETHYST BUTTERFLY EARRINGS  THESE WERE VERY SMALL --A PERFECT SIZE FOR LITTLE GIRLS-- BUT I WEAR THEM AS CASUAL WEAR AND FEEL GREAT...VERY GOOD QUALITY....AND I AM AN AMETHYST LOVER...SO THESE WERE A MID-PURPLE ..NOT PALE AT ALL. <end>  Disappointing....  I bought these earrings for myself along with several other pieces of jewelry on Black Monday as gifts for my adult female friends. I'm very disappointed with the sizes of everything I bought; Amazon should show pictures that are more "true to size" in the future for jewelry items.As to the color of the stones, they are "ok", but just "ok". I was expecting a deeper, richer purple color than I received. I love amethysts and they are my birthstone, so I have several pieces to compare these with and these are truly lacking in tonal quality.They really are more fitting in size for a little girl instead of a grown woman. They are stud earrings, and they are cute, but tiny!!! I'm really glad now that I didn't buy the matching pendant, it would look ridiculous on me. If you are looking for a perfect gift for a young lady of 6-13 years old, then these earrings and the matching pendant would be the thing to buy.I won't be buying any more jewelry items from Amazon unless they start showing accurate photographs of their products. <end>  A SAFE BET & A GREAT BUY  I wasn't too sure about having jewelry being made by Amazon (who knew?) but took the plunge. It came in a dark blue box with a velvet like pouch inside. I held my breath as I opened the pouch......Amazing! The earrings look exactly as pictured here. The quality and craftship are amazing especially when factoring in the price. Why buy fake jewelry when you can get the real thing at these prices? This was purchased as a gift for a younger relative but now I will be buying some in this line for myself.These earring look like they cost a lot more then they did and I'm hoping the cost doesn't increase with the demand. <end>  Gorgeous color!  These earrings are even more beautiful in person. The 4 marquise stones in each earring are perfectly matched and the silver workmanship is excellent. Could not be happier with the quality and the value! <end>  Very nice Butterfly earrings  I bought these as a gift for my wife for Valentines day, she loved them.They came in a nice little black bag inside the box. <end>  Butterfly earings  It was a wonderful experience. The earrings are cute. It was sent quickly and got here fast. I am Very happy with my purchase and the service. <end>  Good Value  These butterfly earrings are a very good value and look just like they are pictured. They are small aand great for small ear lobes. <end>  maybe mine were just defective  Other poor reviews seem to mention the color as problem, but I felt the earrings were very true to the color and appearance in the images. My daughter loved them, unfortunately the post separated from the butterfly on the first wearing on one of the earrings and the other earring post also began to bend from the other earring. Maybe I just got a bad set. <end>  great quick service  I was very happy with the product as it was a gift for my wife. Very nice condition and quickly shipped. Very reliable. I would recommend this to anybody. <end>  amethyst butterfly earrings  My daughter got these for me last year and I love them! Deep color and nice sturdy posts. After having them for a year I still consider them worth a 5 star review. <end>  sent necklace instead of earrings  I ordered a Necklace and Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings to match and sent it as a gift . They received 2 necklaces the same and no earrings . I have reordered the earrings n another necklace so i will give another set of these as a gift ....... and I will keep all but there is a price difference in the earrings 19.99 and the necklace u sent was 12.99 . So u owe me $3.00 credit . Thank you , JudySterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings <end>  BEAUTIFUL earrings  I purchased these earrings originally as a gift for one friend, selecting the garnet earrings. They were literally so beautiful I gasped. The quality of the product was amazingly top notch, considering the price was so low! So I promptly ordered two more sets for two more friends. I would have ordered more - but I had already purchased gifts for everyone on my list. Highly recommend this to anyone on a budget. They are very delicate, small, SHINY, look expensive -- and really beautiful. I can see how the garnet earrings sold-out. The amethyst earrings are still beautiful, but the garnet , by far is the best choice. <end>  Cute, Sparkly and Shiny  These earrings are adorable! They are perfect size for young girls, which is exactly what I'd hoped, since I bought them for my 8 year old daughter. I chose the amethyst stones and they were all a matching, beautiful shade of purple. The silver settings were well made. The posts are a little delicate and seem like they were easy to bend and the backings are not very secure. Those are my only two complaints and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, but for the price, these are great earrings. They are packaged in a small, black, drawstring bag placed in a small, black jewlery box. <end>  Gift for Girlfriend  My girlfriend has loved them, and the matching ring & necklace, for nearly an entire year. She receives compliments all the time. The stones are not pale, so there appears to be inconsistency. If you get a crap pair, send them back for an exchange. Contrary to several comments, unless your taste's lend to earrings that hang to your shoulders, these are a fine size, and noticeable without being gaudy. <end>  Love it  When I first received it, it was a bit smaller than what I imagined, but its still very beautiful  ) <end>  beautiful  they are very well made and look better in person what a great deal. bought them as a gift i want a pair too <end>  As advertised. Very pretty  Perfect size for young granddaughter She love butterflies. The color is rich purple and is her favorite color. Nicely packaged for gift giving <end>  Not Right Color  The Earrings you sent me are real light in color not the pretty dark color you show in the picture. They look almost light pink. I will keep them they are also pretty but not what I expected. <end>  Beautiful earrings!  I bought the butterfly necklace last year for my mom and she loved it so much I bought her the earrings. Beautiful! <end>  Nice detail  I really liked wearing these earrings. They aren't teeny-weeny,but a decent size that they're not gaudy. I wear them cause they look really feminine. <end>  Pretty Butterflies  They are not too small and not too large. They are very pretty, and they are a nice shade of purple. They didn't cost too much. They are, however, way too heavy. I've had my ears pierced for many many years now and they don't have those elongated drag marks because I don't wear heavy earrings so I know I won't be wearing these often at all. And I also know I won't be gifting them to the 8 year old I'd originally planned to give them to. Too bad. Good Quality though. <end>  Amazinq  I bouqht these for my mom for mothers day. She absolutely loves them! They are beautiful. Thank you. Everyone who sees them tell her how beautiful they are. super happy with this <end>  Smaller then expected...  These earrings were smaller than expected. You have to be very careful about the back, they can be messed up easily. <end>  great earings  The earings are very cute. I love them. The only thing is that they are a little bit smaller than I expected. If they are little bigger in size, it would be perfect. <end>  Not the true color of the pictures  I purchased a pair of sterling silver RED GARNET earrings for my best friend for Christmas. I was extremely disappointed with the color of the stone. The stone is more of an amber color and will not go with anything. My best friend would truly be disappointed as red is her favorite color. I will never purchase another item from this company. <end>  perfect for little girls!  I ordered these for my niece who insisted on getting pierced ears for her 3rd birthday. These are perfect, completely appropriate for her. It is nice to find butterfly earrings for a little girl that aren't made of cheap metal. These will last a long time, assuming she doesn't loose one! <end>  childish  Bought these as a stocking stuffer for my wife, she thought they were too small and somewhat childish. Gave them to our 6 yr old daughter she loves them <end>  Fantastic!  These earrings are the perfect size, are very tasteful, and have rather gorgeous gem stones. My wife absolutely loved them! <end>  nice  This item &iacute;s a beutiful gift for someone that loves earings Nice yo wear i would say its a perfect gift <end>  Very Cute  I ordered these earrings for my 8 year old daughter. They are very cute and were actually a little larger than I expected. Though, I did not read the dimensions before purchasing. They look identical to the picture and arrived in this little pouch. Great price, as well. Happy with my purchase. <end>  Loved them  If butterflies are special to your wife, girlfriend then these hit the spot. She loved them, Wel worth the money <end>  Nice product  I bought these as a gift for my wife on Valentine's day. We don't usually exchange gifts for V-day but I thought I would give her a nice token gift. The quality seems better than the price paid. They are a little smaller than I thought but once she put them on they looked fine. You usually get what you pay for but I think the quality of the earings are worth more than what Amazon is asking for. I would recomend as a token type gift but don't give them for a birthday or Anniversary guys. <end>  Beautiful  Just a beautiful piece of jewelry. I bought it for my niece and she loves it. It's as beautiful in reality as it is in the picture.. <end>  Cute earrings  Got these for my younger cousin who was twelve, and its perfect for everyday use. She loves butterflies and her birthstone is amethyst so it was perfect for her <end>  My wife loved it  It was a homecoming gift to my beloved wife. She is crazy about butterflies. She loved it so much. She also loved the fact that it is not so big and was the perfect size. Although I didn't find the gift card I requested with it. <end>  silver and amethyst butterfly  The pendant and earrings are pretty but very small, and I think they are overpriced for what you get. I could have gotten the same at Claire's for about half the price. <end>  poor color quality on two out of three  I bought three of the butterfly earrings and two of the three pair were poor quality amethyst color. Very light shade of purple. I suppose I got my money's worth considering what I paid for them. I gave them only one star. <end>  Never buy this  its look so cheap , don't worth a dollar .. very disappointed with this item . planning to return it back <end>  It was really good  Umm well i really them. They dont bother me on my ears or anything. Btw their not Ruby's slight mistake on my part. <end>  Disappointing quality and va;ue  Not at all as expected. The jewelry arrives with a small bag, no gift box. It is way overpriced! This is probably worth less than half of the price. We did not give it as intended, it would have been embarrassing to give this as a gift.We will probably return it, and not buy from this collection again. <end>  Butterfly Granet earrings.  Smaller than I had thought but came on time and good quality for the price. Should be a gift for a small person <end>  Xmas gift  She liked it. Nicer than expected although very small. She still liked it. She has very very very long hair and they don't get tangled in her hair. I love very long hair. <end>  defective product  Generally my experience of buying product at Amazon is good. one of the ear ring back fixture is loose so it cannnot be wore and i lost the back fixture very first day when i wore it <end>  Sterling Silver Gemstone Butterfly Earrings  These earrings ended up being the perfect size! They go great with almost everything! I like to wear them with black, brown, and white! They add a boost of color to any outfit! I absolutely love these earrings! <end>  Great buy!!!  I bought these for my 10 yr old niece for Christmas. Purple is her favorite color so when the earrings arrived I was so happy that the amethysts were so bright and vibrant. I disagree that they are too small as others have said. I think they could be worn by anyone. These are such a great price considering they are real amethysts in sterling silver. Very happy with them and so was my niece!!!! <end>  Beautiful Earrings.  The earrings were better than I had expected them to be and can't wait to give them as a gift. <end>  She liked them  My kids and I gave these to my wife for Christmas and she liked them. Want to be a happy man, have a happy wife. <end>  Good gift  Very nice & suitable for a Christmas gift. My wife enjoyed these ear rings for every day use. The price was very reasonable. <end>  Wife loved them!  Purchased these for my wife, for Christmas. They are indeed lighter in color than the picture, a very faint purple. They are also fairly small. But they are beautiful, quality pieces of jewelry. <end>  beautiful !!!  Bought these for my 5 year daughter..perfect size for her little ears. They came in a little black velvet bag so when she opened the box she still didn't know what they were until she looked inside the bag. She loves them too. <end>  High Quality and very pretty  These earrings arrived carefully wrapped in a box and then in a lovely pouch. They are high quality earrings and look very pretty. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a penchant for butterflies or just for cute earrings! They arrived quickly and safely so I would also recommend this seller. <end>  It wasn't real sterling silver  Once I put it on. (Which I even clean my earrings b4 I wear them.) my ears started to itch And bother me I had to take them off quick. I'm allergic to fake earring and these gave me a full allegic reaction <end>  Truly cute and versatile!  I love little tiny earrings because I don't like earrings that are too distracting. These earrings are gorgeous, well made and look just like the pictures, albeit smaller, and even kind of more silvery. The silver is very bright. So yes they are pretty small but they are perfect and I find myself opting for these over most of my other earrings. The color is great if you tend to wear dark clothes and have rosy overtones on your skin. <end>  Red is not real  The red in the picture, is nothing like the actual earrings. It is more translucent, and more orangy-red than garnet. Still, comfortable, and stylish. <end>  Very nice  Good quality materials, good craftsmanship, great shine and sparkle, and very nice color match on the amethyst stones. I would recommend them to anyone, and my sister loved them as a birthday present. <end>  good for children  I bought these as a kindergarten graduation present for my daughter. For the price, I didn't have high expectations. They're prefect for children's jewelry in size and quality but not necessarily suitable if you're looking for stunning gemstone jewelry for an adult. The posts bend under the slightest pressure, so I wouldn't recommend sleeping with them on either. <end>  gorgeous and dainty  I JUST RECEIVED MY EARRINGS AND OMG THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL SOME REVIEWS WERE SAYING THERE WERE TOO SMALL AND THE COLOR WASNT RIGHT AND I HAVE TO SAY THEY ARE JUST PERFECT I DIDNT WANT ANY BIG HONKIN BUTTERFLIES ON MY EARS CAUSE MY EARS ARE SO SMALL BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY I LOVE THEM I CANT WAIT TO WHERE THEM .... <end>  Beauiful Amethyst Butterfly Earrings  I bought these ear rings for myself. They are medium dark stones, and beautiful as well. I love them and they are very comfortable on my ears. I'm considering ordering a pair for my friend. <end>  Small but beautiful  Beautiful as described but realize these earrings are very small, especially for an adult. I gave them to my mother as a birthday present and she has worn them twice this week alone- she says she loves them. They are very pretty but because of their small size they do not capture a lot of attention. <end>  Quality and Beauty  I purchased the earrings during a gold box savings deal. Every time I wear them I get compliments. Excellent buy for a gift. <end>  Very pretty; very awful packaging.  Very pretty, sparkle, deep purple - just right size for a child - our 6-year old niece will love. Box arrived on time -- but badly dented; tape had either been broken or not carefully sealed at one end of shipping box. Gift packaging awful -- large bar code sticker on bottom of small black gift box; nothing that says these are real gems+silver. Small black cloth bag, earrings inside that bag and then in an even smaller plastic zip bag. Backs not attached to studs; since very small, very easy to drop and not ever find again. What is happening to Amazon --- 1st time, after years of purchases, we've returned a book, a necklace with a broken clasp, and if the earrings were not so pretty -- these would also be returned.Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings <end>  exeactly as pictured  The earrings are very pretty and exactly as pictured. They were a little bit big for my 3 year's ears but she still loves them. <end>  girl friend loved them  they are smaller than you think but when they are in the ears they are perfect i got them for my girl friend and she loved them. they are nice get them <end>  Beautiful Garnet Butterfies  These beautiful butterfly stud earings came to us exactly as advetised. They were given to my wife a s gift and she loves them. Size and color is just as pictured and very nice. Can be warn any time and with any thing. I read the negative reviews and sure am glad I did not follow them! <end>  disappointed  Though I have started liking the earrings now, they are nowhere similar to the picture displayed. The picture shows red butterfly earrings but the earrings that were parceled to me did not have any hint of the red color, instead they had an orange tint. It is very disappointing to know that Amazon can put up such misleading pictures to attract customers. On the better side, I must mention that the size of the earrings did meet up to my expectations. <end>  garnet butterfly earrings  The product was what I expected after viewing a picture of it prior to purchasing. It is a retirement gift; free as a butterfly when she retires. <end>  Garnet Butterfly Earings  I was a little hesadent to purchase this item. Not knowing the size. I was pleasadnly surprised the quality and size of this item. <end>  Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings  I purchased earrings for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves butterflies, the color purple and her birthstone is Amethyst. Must have been a hit because she has them on everytime I see her! <end>  amethyst earrings  My wife loved these.I bought them for her last Christmas and she's stillwearing them regularly. <end>  Earrings  They were a gift to me from my husband. They are beautiful and as small as described. Beautiful color. Will not disappoint. <end>  pretty in purple  I wanted to get some cute earrings for my second holes and I saw these. They are a little big and the back is constantly coming off but They are pretty and I like them. I'm happy! <end>  Lovely  My husband give it to me as a present, they are lovely  ), not to big, not to small, just perfect for my ears. <end>  nowhere near as shiny as the picture makes it appear  I bought the earrings in Amethyst color for $19 and was quite disappointed when the earrings arrived. The earrings are a lot smaller than what I have imagined and the color is nowhere near as shiny as the picture makes it appear (Both earring are dark purple in color). The "body" and "antenna" part of the butterflies are a lot darker than what's shown in the product image as well. These earring aren't ugly (I like the butterfly shape), but if you are looking for something that is shiny and stands out or delicate, these earrings are probably not the best choice. <end>  Beautiful!  Bought these earrings for my daughters birthday 'cause we bought the necklace for her for Christmas and she loved it. She loves the earrings too. <end>  wife loves them  got these to match the neckless I got her a while ago and they match like the set they are. <end>  earings  My husband got me these for my birthday,I love them but dont let the size fool you, they are very small. So amazon you need to put the right size on there, that is false advertising. I got the necklace to match and that is so tiny you hardly see it. The earings are pretty though and comfortable. The color is very pretty too, like a deep purple. <end>  Better late than never!!  These butterfly earrings were out of stock. I was notified by e-mail and continued to get e-mails updating the status on this order. They arrived a couple of weeks later, and they were worth the wait.They really catch the light, very pretty. <end>  Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings  Gave these as a gift for my daughters birthday. She loved them and I thought they were really nice. There was only one problem, the stud post are smaller than the backs and she lost the set twice before we finally found a set of backs that would keep them on. Great buy but check out the post and backs before you wear them out. <end>  Butterfly earrings  Delivery was fast and accurate. Product is beautiful. Butterflies are a little thicker...not as delicate as I would have thought, but they are very pretty and I am happy with the purchase. <end>  Beautiful Butterfly Earrings  These earrings are so beautiful. I wish I got two pair. I gave this set to my niece and she loves them. Hope they come back I would definately get a pair for myself. <end>  What I expected  I gave it this rating because I got what I paid for. The earrings are small and shiny, but nothing of too great value. They look nice and were appreciated by the receiver who like butterfly's. I would suggest this as a stocking stuffer or as something extra to a total package of gifts. <end>  Beautiful  These are just amazingly beautiful earrings. I also purchased the matching pendant and i love wearing them together. I have gotten quite a few comments already from people and friends. <end>  Buterfly Earrings  Too small. The pictures were deceiving. Must have used a Magnifying glass.Other than the small size they were very nice. <end>  Earrings  They were a Christmas present. My wife was extremely pleased with them, particularly the color of the stones. Excellent value <end>  Not what I expected  The 2 choices for the butterfly earrings were garnet and amethyst. I ordered garnet...should be dark red...they are pink! The person I ordered them for hates pink...not what I expected! <end>  Amythyst Butterfly Earrings  If you love butterflies and amythyst as much as I do you will be extremely satisfied. As a bonus, shipping was free and I wore them the next day. Thank you. I recently bought the black diamond pendant. Though, I was not as lucky because I had to pay shipping and probably will not be receiving it for about another two weeks.Happy holidays. <end>  Christmas Gift for Friend  It arrived just as promised. Very pretty. And I just gave it to my friend and she loves it and says it is beautiful. <end>  Nice  This earrings are small yet beautiful and makes a wonderful accent to my wardrobe. I will be able to enjoy these for years to come. <end>  Excellent Quality  I was very pleased with the purchase. It was as advertised and the quality was good for the price. It made it a great gift. <end>  A nice gift but can't comment on the recipient's reception yet.  The color is bright yet translucent and the metallic portion is shiny and bright. I don't know if her ears will adopt to the pins, only time will tell. <end>  Beautiful but small  Sterling Silver Citrine Butterfly EarringsThese are very pretty but I think they are for a "tweener" or petite girl. I also bought the necklace that matches and they are a really nice combo. Color is lighter than view on line. <end>  Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings  Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly EarringsGreat product, a bit over priced for the over all quality. Product was a birthday present for my wife, she was pleased. <end>  B-day earring  I like butterflies and amethyst. They are great quality. And I really like them alot. <end>  Amethyst Butterfly earrings  These earrings are the perfect size. They look nice and go with almost anything. They were a good value for the price. <end>  They're ok I guess  The earrings are cute but I see a young girl wearing them more so than me. <end>  Great Bargain, nice gift  I purchased these and the matching necklace for my daughter, She loves them. I was surprised by the quality. Well made. I would recommend this to anyone. Only downside is that the clasp on the necklace will require great eyesight or nimble fingers to use. <end>  Very Pretty!  Just bought these for my sister for her birthday. She loved them. They are small, but absolutely gorgeous - they just sparkle! Got them on sale so the price was right, too! <end>  Pretty color butterfly earrings  Earrings were very pretty but smaller than expected. I didn't see at the time of my purchase that you carry the matching necklace. <end>  Small but appreciated  These are definitely small butterflies, easily fitting within the diameter of a dime, if you don't have a dime available take a look at your pinky nail, that's probably a reasonable approximation for most people.That being said some people prefer smaller jewelery and so keep that in mind when purchasing this item for adults. It is beautiful jewelery that was greatly appreciated as a gift in my case. <end>  Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Earrings  These earrings were purchased as a gift. They arrived promptly and are beautiful. The recipient appeared to like them a lot. <end>
 B000MK9WU2  Yellow Gold Diamond Cut Claddagh Religious Cross with chain ||	  beautiful concept of a Claddagh Cross, but is not what it seems....  Really liked the concept of how this Claddagh Cross looked, however on receipt, it looks very cheaply stamped out & without dimension. A shame, it could be beautiful.... <end>
 B000MLHAKK  BLACK JEWELRY harp BRACELET RACK Stand HOLDER gift NEW ||	  I love the Jewelry Harp!  I bought this jewelry harp for my daughter to organizer her jewelry and it works wonderfully. She hangs her necklaces from the top bar and uses the other two for bracelets and rings. She can see everything at a glance and it has a sturdy base and is very pretty to look at. I highly recommend this product. <end>  Absolutely Fantastic Product  I saw this product at my friend's house and thought it would be great for me to better organize those big bangles I have all over the place. I placed the order and this item did not disappoint. To my surprise I had way more bracelets than I realized because out of sight really is out of mind. Soo guess what?! I've ordered another one.The holders are sleek and make your dresser feel organized. The only thing I wish was a bit different was that it was easier to fasten and unfasten the holder to get your bracelets off. That doesn't deter me from giving this product a 5 though! <end>  good bracelet rack!  i love this item! i removed one star because i think the quality could be a little better - the top rung is barely long enough to sit on the hooks properly. i had to slightly bend the lyre to make it fit. otherwise, it's a good item at such a low price. <end>  Bracelet organizer  I am very happy with this product. It looks great on my bombei chest and holds all my bracelets (which there are many of). I would recommend this to anyone looking to organize and display their jewelry. <end>  its OK  This rack came bent...but when i look it is bent (crooked looking) in the photo so I guess I should have paid more attention. The three bars came separate and just lightly sit on the hooks making it easy to knock off one bar while trying to put jewelery on/off the other bars. It came chipped and dirty looking. I will keep it as it was a low price but I can't recommend it to others. <end>  Gets the job done  Nothing fancy. This product is pretty affordable and my jewelry (bracelets) look pretty neat in this organizer. I've gotten a good use out of this item. I like it <end>  LOVE IT  This rack it is one of the best organizer I have ever bought. It's a great idea! Finally I get to see what I have and don't wast time trying to untangle my necklaces. It's tall so you need space to fit it, but it's is just great. And it holds about 20 things... Love it! <end>  Great invention!  I love my new bracelet holder. No more mess on the dresser. They are organized and it looks wonderful! Highly recommend! <end>  Perfect  I'm so happy to get all the clutter off my dresser. The finish of the black bracelet holder is smooth which makes it easy to slide off what you want. <end>  gd  just get it cuz better to put breclets on it and can use it easy .. ... ... ... ... .. ... ... .. <end>  Not worth the $!  This was a waste of $17 for me...the base is nice and sturdy, but if all you want to do is look at and admire your bracelets, go ahead and get it. If you actually are always taking bracelets on and off it is a real pain. To get a bracelet you want off, you are holding the base and yanking on a bar, that is tight and secure in its holding clip...all the bracelets either must come off to get to one in the middle, or they will fall off in the process of all this yanking.I swallowed my loss and instead went and purchased something like this, but I found it in black faux leather on competitor Eeeebay...its over $30 but worth it [...]This item is not only very nice looking, but sturdy, the faux leather is really nice, love this piece, it displays your items so beautifully.Or try this one [...] <end>  DIdn't get what I ordered  I ordered the bracelet holder and received the necklace holder. Trying to send something back costs more time and expense than the item is worth. <end>  Was very displeased, it was bent when it came in  It was bent when it came in, the company requested just pictures of it and I sent them a letter along with the pictures and decided if it was that flimsy I didn't want it and just to give me a refund. They in turn, sent me another one, so I'm awaiting a response to another letter to tell me what to do, because I requested to them not to send another one. Now another trip to the post office.Sharon M <end>  Great Product and Great Value!  Length   0 57 MinsI really love this product. It is super useful in reducing my bracelet clutter, and in comparison to other jewelry organizers, this is a very good value. In rebuttal to another review, the stand is not flimsy, but rather, it is very sturdy. Another reviewer complained that the holding clips on the bars are too tight, and they were when I received mine, but I loosened them (just pushed with my fingers) and placed bars on the loose hooks and it works great, its effortless to lift off and retrieve bracelets now. I highly recommend this item to anyone looking for an attractive way to organize jewelry. I also purchased the two other racks in this seriesSILVER JEWELRY harp Earring RACK stand HOLDERandSilver JEWELRY harp NECKLACE RACK stand HOLDER gift. <end>  Convenient way to organize bracelets!  I received this rack as a Christmas gift and I absolutely love it! I was having a hard time with my bracelets before and didn't know where to keep them, and even remembering what I owned! This display rack makes things so much easier. They are a little on the small side if you have a lot of bracelets like I do (I have about 50 or so bracelets of different widths crammed on here). I think it would more comfortably house around 30 bracelets averaging around 1/2 inch wide (just a rough guesstimate). It just makes a world of difference and looks great on a dresser! I definitely recommend to anyone who has a pile of bracelets lying around and would like a nice way to organize them. <end>  Bracelets galore!  This holder is very efficient, it can hold a lot, except I recommend putting this away from cracks because sometimes they slip off when taking off or putting on bracelets. <end>  It's cool but...  I gave this product 3 stars becuase paint job or varnishing was done half ass it had red fibers rolled around and stuck on the 3 rods, I was grossed out by it. It seems as if they dropped it after painting it. you think you'd take precaution when painting/varnishing. hmmph was disappointed. I dont want to go through the hassel of returning it. Its cool rack tho. So makers take more caution with your products.! <end>  PERFECT!!!!!!!  Normally I would leave my bangles all over my house and when I was ready to wear one in particular I could not find. The harp bracelet rack made me more organized and looks great on my dresser it. It can be cumbersome to take the bracelets off the last row, but once you get the hang of it your fine. <end>  Great way to display and store bracelets  I have several of these bracelet racks. They hold many bangles, cuffs, and bracelets where I can easily see them. <end>  Looks nice, but lacks functionality  The bracelet stands looks great with all of my bracelets displayed. However, when it comes time to add or remove a bracelet, it is very difficult to open and close the clasps that hold the rods. When I first got the stand, I thought I was going to break it because I had to pull so hard to open the clasps. <end>  Great Holder!!  I love this holder. I can place my watches and bracelets on it and it holds a lot! It's very sturdy and I love being able to see all my bracelets and watches very easily compared to searching through a box. You can see it being used a video I made about ideas to organize your jewelry on youtube, just search for my username XDHappyBear <end>  Jewelry holders  Now I can see what I have, instead of searching through boxes and drawers when I am trying to leave the house! <end>  All I can say is AWESOME  I've been looking for some time for a way to organize and easily find my jewelry....I bought this set of 3 and wow - it's perfect. I'd say, it was cheaper to buy each piece separately vs the bundle they sale...You won't regret buying these. They are very stable and attractive without being too much. <end>
 B000MM5TDE  Sterling Silver Dolphin in Loop Pendant, Pink Synthetic Opal Inlay w/ CZ stones, 1 3/8 inch tall, ||	  sterling silver dolphin  I'm in love with dolphins this has nice quality although I was really looking for the dolphin moving thru the hoop this is all one piece. <end>
 B000MM9BC4  Sterling Silver Octopus Pendant Synthetic Opal Inlay w/ CZ stones, 1 1/4 inch tall, ||	  Not as pictured  My husband bought this pendant as a birthday gift to me since I am a fan of all things octopus and opal is my birthstone. When it arrived, he was disappointed that the opal was blue (I guess it is supposed to be similar to a black opal) and cheap-looking. I wouldn't dare let him return it because it was the thought behind the gift that mattered to me and I liked it despite it not being the color opal we wanted. However, if you are buying this for yourself, be aware that it may not be set with a traditional white opal. I wish the seller had let him specify what he wanted, maybe if you contact the seller you can get exactly what is pictured. <end>
 B000MMAU1K  Sterling Silver Slide Pendant Synthetic Opal Inlay 7 X 9 mm Oval Amethyst CZ 1 1/8 inch long, ||	  Beautiful!  I purchased this pendant awhile ago and I still get compliments on it whenever I wear it. It is a very pretty piece and was a fantastic price. I highly recommend this product. <end>  exactly right  I just love this pendant. I bought it to match earrings and a ring that I already owned. The picture on the website is exactly the way it looks and it is very beautiful. Great price! This is a just the right size and weight. I would have paid more if it came with a chain.I am very happy that I have this. <end>  Perfect  The picture does not do this pendant justice. It's gorgeous and makes a bold statement. It seems to be very sturdy and well made. <end>
 B000MMAUOM  Sterling Silver Hammerhead Shark Pendant Synthetic Opal Inlay w/ CZ stones, 2 1/16 inch tall, ||	  eye catching  I like this piece, it's large, well made and eye catching. People notice it when I wear it and ask what it is. The opals sparkle, and I like it a lot. It's not too heavy but I think it's best on a long chain, not a choker around your neck.

 B000MPQUIY  2.00 Ct.T.W. Genuine Round Peridot in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Earrings ||	  Beautiful earrings-spectacular holiday gift  Another Peora purchase. I bought these for Christmas from a friend who loves peridot. The color on these is deep and rich. The packaging is absolutely lovely and perfect for gift giving. Delivery took two days. These are a medium size earring and will look good on younger or not so young women. Very reasonably priced. Look much more expensive. <end>  Great gift  Bought these a Christmas gift for a friend. She loved them and wears them all the time. They look awesome on. <end>
 B000MQFO6C  Aquamarine Ring W/ Diamonds & Yellow Beryl 14k Gold New ||	  Great ring!  This ring is breath-taking and at such a great price! It looks even better than the photo and everyone who has seen it loves it! Aquamarine rings are so expensive, even for a small stone, and this stone is HUGE and beautiful and surrounded by yellow beryls and diamonds! The ring came very quickly and also was very well packed. I highly recommend this vendor! <end>
 B000MQFQGA  1.00 Carat Round Genuine Garnet Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Ring ||	  Nuce ring  Nice ring - stone is very pretty and the setting is different. The band is lighter and thinner than I expected, but still, overall a nice ring at a good price. <end>

 B000MQJ1PC  1.50 Ct.T.W. Genuine Oval Shape Amethyst in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Earrings ||	  Great-looking studs  This pair of studs is very sleek & elegant. The amethyst is a sparkling rich purple & surrounded with swirling silver which adds to its contrast. The stone is big & stands out very well on the ear lobe. The design is very different with the stone slanting at an angle. It's a great looking stud. <end>
 B000MQJOIQ  1.25 Carats Marquise Cut Genuine London Blue Topaz Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Pendant Necklace ||	  Beautiful Color  I was thrilled when I took this pendant out of the package. The setting is very pretty, and the topaz is gorgeous. The color is deeper and more saturated in real life than it is on the picture, and is exactly what I look for in a London Blue. The cut is lovely as well--the stone has lovely proportions, and is very sparkly.It's also durable. I've worn it to sleep, and have taken a few showers with it, and it's held up well. I'm very happy with this necklace! <end>
 B000MQKKMK  Pair of Glass Single Flared Solid Plugs  12g Ocean ||	  Ocean Glass  I'm very pleased with these plugs, the o-rings are tight, they are true to size and the color is very vibrant. <end>
 B000MQMDVQ  Pair of Glass Double Flared Eyelets  4g, Ruby ||	  Pretty, interesting, but don't stay in very well  Could just be my ears *shrug* Love the jewelry though, and didn't consider the difficulty I had keeping them in in my review score. <end>
 B000MQNODC  Pair of Glass Single Flared Solid Plugs  6g Ocean ||	  Nice little plugs  I had some concerns about the O-rings staying put and keeping this plug from falling out, but I was pleased by it's resilience. The plug its self is awesome, and you can't beat the price. <end>
 B000MQNOMS  Pair of Glass Double Flared Solid Plugs  0g Cobalt ||	  very cute  I ordered these cobalt blue glass plugs in the 0g size. They seem a bit shorter than in the picture, but are just the right length to fit my earlobes snugly. When viewed from the front (while being worn), they appear very dark blue, almost black... the color appears more blue when light is shining through them. They're great for work (or anytime you want your gauged ears to be a bit more subtle/toned-down) because they look almost like "button" style earrings. Overall, they seem well-made and I'm happy w/ them. Mine arrived in a small box padded w/ lots of bubble wrap to prevent breakage. <end>
 B000MREJW6  Sterling Silver Girl's Double Flower Pendant, 13-15" ||	  Beautiful!  The pendant itself was very beautiful! The chain was also equally beautiful but was so small though! I bought it for an eleven year old girl and the chain was so small it wouldn't reach. She is a normal sized girl without a weight problem so her size was not the issue. If you buy this for a little girl older than 5 I would recommend buying a larger chain to go with it. <end>  BUY IT!!  Bought this for my 5 yr old daughter. Fits great! Some reviews said the chain is too short. That is not true. Perhaps for a much older girl. My daughter is normal size and the loosest setting on the adjustable chain is too long right now. This looks great and is sterling silver. My daughter really wanted some jewelry that she could wear in the shower. Great price and very high quality. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to get something nice for a girl 10 and under. <end>  Not what I expected  I bought this for my 10 yr old niece, the chain seemed to be the size more for a 3-5yr old, and the pendant was much larger than I expected. <end>  Nice for the value  The chain is smaller than I thought it would be, but the necklace is very pretty. If you are looking for a gift for someone with simple tastes I highly recommend this. <end>  Good quality  This is a nice necklace and pendant. It was a gift for my flower girl, who is in fourth grade. It fit her well (the chain is adjustable), and the pendant is very nice. Overall, the item is not tacky, and a child or young girl would really enjoy it. <end>  beautiful pendant  My daughter got this necklace for Christmas and really loves the pendant. However she has been unable to wear it because the chain that it came with is way to small. We will have to buy her a new chain for her to wear it- haven't gotten around to that yet  / . <end>  Pretty  I like this necklace. It looks pretty, but my only complaint was that the quality of this "sterling silver" doesn't look quite as good as the ones I've had many times. It looked just a little bit different, like if it was a bit cheaper.. Other than that, I think this would make a nice gift for a girl.  ) <end>  Great Jr. Bridesmaid's Gift  I bought this necklace for my junior bridesmaid (11years) and she loved it. Nice size for a younger child or an adult. <end>  lovely pendant, necklace too small and fragile  My sister loves her new pendant, but she had to use one of her own necklaces to make it fit right. It is too small and too fragile <end>  Purchased for my flower girl ....  I purchased this necklace for my flower girl and she loved it. It was delivered very quickly and for the price, I think it is a great bargain. <end>  Cute  I got 2 of these for my two flowergirls. They loved them. They aren't very expensive, and the quality is good, they were packaged nicely. And there is also a bigger version which I got for my maid of honor and my mother. <end>  above basic  I was hoping it would be a identical to the large flower. It wasn't. The necklace is not as open as it seemed but still pretty. <end>  Perfect Daddy to Daughter Gift!  I gave this to my 7 year-old daughter for her birthday and she has worn it continuously now for over 2 months, so, I'd say it is a big hit! Definitely durable enough to qualify as children's jewelry! <end>  Adorable!  I bought this as my flower girl present for my 5-year old . The charm is very shiny and well made. I'm very happy with this purchase! <end>  Cute Necklace, Poor Value  I bought this necklace because the flowers matched my prom dress perfectly. It is quite cute and the pendant is of a decent size. However, the price is a little steep-$24- for a silver pendant. The chain is also short, but then, I am 18 and the necklace is meant for a young girl. <end>  Great Quality for Great Price  I ordered this necklace for my 6 year-old daughter who misses me at school. I told her to touch the necklace whenever she felt lonely as it will remind her of my love  -) It is a high-quality necklace. It is tailored (in size and scale) for girls but it reminds me of some of my own jewelry in terms of design and finish. This line would make a great "first" Real necklace for your blossoming young lady ! <end>  Lovely  I love this necklace and I get commented on it when my friends and family see it. I bought it as a christmas gift to myself  D I do wish the original chain was a little longer but I just found another chain to replace the one it came with. <end>  Looks even better than the picture  I purchased this necklace for my flower girl, and it's absolutely adorable. The necklace has an adjustable chain, and the pendant itself is very shiny and looks well-made. <end>  Good for flower girls  We gave each of our flower girls this necklace (5 & 7 years old). The necklaces are very nice, and they seemed to like them. <end>  Review  Purchased this as a flower girl gift for my 7 year old niece. It's perfect for the occasion, and very age appropriate. <end>  So pretty!  I bought this as a gift for my niece who was the flower girl at my wedding. She loved it and at almost 3 years old kept saying pretty! I hope she will have it for many years to come - maybe use it as her something old one day or pass it on to her flower girl........ <end>  My niece loves it  I purchased this for my 11 year old niece. The glow in her eyes was worth it. The images on the site do it little justice. It is quite beautiful. <end>  Extra special find  I am engaged, and was looking for something extra special for my flower girls. I spent a very long time looking in different places, until I checked amazon and found this very pretty necklace in sterling silver at a great price and an extra special gift. The picture really does not do it justice either. I was more pleased when it arrived quickly and I opened it to check it out. <end>  necklace  this is so beautiful and I did receive it in time for Christmas.. my niece love it and it was just perfect <end>  Made a little girl very happy!  Met all expectations on Christmas morning. perfect length for 6 yo. Chain is very fine, so it's worn for special occasions. <end>
 B000MSZNC0  Petite Magnolia Jewelry Tree ||	  Too Short!  While this is a very elegant looking tree, I underestimated how large it was going to be. I know it says Petite, but I at least thought that it would be tall enough to hold necklaces on, which it does, but they all touch the ground when they're hanging. For the money, not really worth it. If the normal size one was cheaper, then that's the one to get because at least that one would really be tall enough to hang your necklaces on. <end>
 B000MTBFSA  Southwestern Style Wolf Paw Band Ring in Sterling Silver with Turquoise and Coral Chip Inlay for Men or Women, Size 12, #10519 ||	  Wonderful Present  I purchased this ring for my sweetheart for Valentine's day. He loved it! The paw-prints are very small, but that makes them all the more noticeable, and makes the ring much nicer to wear... subtle, rather than gaudy. I highly recommend it. <end>  Bear Paw Ring  The ring is wonderful!!!!!!! It is a little heavier than I expected, but I'm extremely pleased it is. It is GORGEOUS!! I have gotten dozens of compliments in the short time I've had the ring. <end>  well  well,I received this ring and love it. However, it is not exactly like the one I thought it should be ~~~~However, it is fine I think~ <end>
 B000MURMEA  Southwestern Style Horse & Pony Story Band Ring in Sterling Silver for Men or Women, size 13, #10825 ||	  Beautiful Detail  This was purchased as a gift for my 16 year old niece. She loves horses and is an avid rider. She loved it. The detail was impressive and it's not big and bulky. Very dainty. <end>  hores band ring  I have alot of rings but cannot wear certain kinds at work-since I am such a horse lover-this is a perfect ring for me to wear on my job- I gave it a good rate because it is durable in the hard work I do -and the price is right- love this <end>
 B000MUSZ4G  1.50 Ct.T.W. Genuine Trillion Cut London Blue Topaz in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Earrings ||	  just O.K  I got the earrings few weeks ago, and even though they are pretty, the back of it looks cheap. You cant see it in the pictures but the frame of the back of the earrings are empty giving it a cheap look. I got it for my mom but I decided to keep it to myself and get her something else. <end>

 B000MW8NZA  Oval Shape Sapphire Pendant Earrings Set in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Chain broke within a week  Pretty, but quality is obviously poor.Chain broke within a week. Seller would not answer my e-mail asking for a replacement or repair. I would have been happy even to pay for it.Cannot recommend this seller. <end>  Beautiful Set  I bought this set to wear for formal night on an upcoming cruise. It is absolutely beautiful. The earrings are not too heavy, and the necklace is the perfect length. The stones are a little lighter in color than I would have liked, but all in all a great set. <end>
 B000MWAKG0  4.50 carats Oval Shape Garnet Pendant Earrings Set in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Garnett pendant necklace & earrings  Very nice jewelry set.

 B000MWEFIY  14k White Gold Diamond Martini Glass Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Very nice  I looked everywhere for a martini charm for my sister's 21st birthday. I had a hard time finding something that looked quality. This charm is gorgeous. It is a little smaller than I expected, but worked perfectly with the charm bracelet. <end>
 B000MWEFYS  14k White Gold Diamond "Love" Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Very poor quality diamonds--dull and chipped!  I also owned 2 other pendants from Amazon.com, 14k white gold diamond key to my heart and 14k white gold diamond wishbone, both have small(total of .12 carats) and quality G-H color diamonds. Compared to those two pendants, this charm's diamonds are poor in quality--chipped and dull.I returned it almost immediately. <end>

 B000MWEH64  14k White Gold Diamond Horse Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Tiny horse head charm  I bought this as a Christmas gift. Even though it was very small (3/4"), it was well crafted and looked exactly like the picture. It came in a small pouch inside a black velvet box. The closure clip was not attached and only had one link attached to the horse head. I thought this was done purposely so it could be attached to a necklace by the link or if it was to be attached to a bracelet you could attach the closure to it and then attach it to the bracelet. The gift was well received. <end>
 B000MWGC1C  14k White Gold Diamond Girl Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Cute, but not as many diamonds as it appears in the picture.  I purchased this for my mother-in-laws birthday. It is very cute but the only thing that I was disappointed with is that the picture makes it look like the entire middle has diamonds in it, but there are only a few held in by either white gold or maybe silver. <end>
 B000MWGCT4  14k White Gold Diamond Initial "Z" Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  don't send as a gift  It has a tag on it that is bigger than the charm that says Made in China. Probably worth about 3 dollars not anywhere near the listed price. <end>
 B000MWGD5M  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Key Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  As shown  The charm was as shown too small for me I gave it to my daugther she loved it <end>
 B000MWHGEE  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Sneaker Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  smaller than I expected  I ordered this to wear on a necklace with other "bootie type charms" I have representing my 4 children. When I received it I realized that it was too small next to the others I have.It is very cute and would work wonderfully on a charm bracelet or on its own as a delicate necklace charm. <end>
 B000MWHH2U  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Fireman's Shield Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Feminine style Maltese cross  My eighteen year old daughter is an interior qualified firefighter for our town's volunteer department. When she completed her Firefighter 1 training, I wanted to give her a Maltese cross. The majority are masculine. This is a very high quality white gold charm. You must see it to believe how truly beautiful it is, looks very expensive. Heavy weight in hand. <end>
 B000MWJF6Q  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Leo Zodiac Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  A Slight Disappointment  While I like the charm, I have to be completely honest in that I was slightly disappointed. I expected it to be much more substantial. It is very light weight and the diamond presence is very small. The design, however, is very pretty and I really like that aspect of it. Some might like the weight of it because it won't weigh down their charm bracelet or make a lot of noise. I just happen to like my charms to be more substantial. <end>
 B000MWJFDO  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Ballet Slipper Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  ballet charm  This was a perfect gift for my grandniece, an aspiring ballerina! She wears it on a chain araound her neck. <end>
 B000MWJFFC  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Baby Bottle Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Very cute charm  I loved this charm, however I thought it would be a real round bottle and it is only on the front. Also was going to use it on a tiffany like charm bracelette and the clasp does not fit around the metal ring of my bracelette so I have to get a small gold ring to attach it. The diamonds are very nice and overall I am pleased and feel that the price is good for the item. <end>
 B000MWJGKQ  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Initial "S" Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  14K YELLOW GOLD DIAMOND INITIAL "S" CHARM (1/10 CTTW)  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Initial "S" Charm (1/10 cttw), WHICH I COULD ONLY FIND IN "AMAZON COLLECTION" UNDER JEWELRY. I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE, SO, MUCH SO THAT I PURCHASED THE LETTERS "A" AND "P". WHICH ARE THE THREE INITIALS IN MY NAME DISPLAYED ON A CUSTOM MADE CHARM HOLDER. <end>
 B000MWY7CS  1/10 ct. tw. Sapphire and Yellow Gold Round-Cut Earrings ||	  Mom Loves Them!  I bought these for my mom for her anniversary.

I would recommend this bracelet to others. <end>  Good quality...  Although not a jeweler, these pearls appear to be bright, smooth, and nicely sized. They well match the other pearl items I purchased together. <end>  Great product and customer service  The seller of these pearls was fantastic to work with. There was a problem to where I wanted the pearls sent, but the seller reshipped me a new product at no extra charge. I would definitely order from them again! Not to mention, the pearls were beautiful! <end>  This is a great bargain for a beautiful bracelet!!  I got this for my birthday and love it. I have a pearl necklace and it matches perfectly. The pearls are of very high quality and good size. The luster is excellent in this item. I am very happy with this product and the price was a steal!! <end>  Akoya Saltwater Pearl Bracelet  The actual product, i.e. the pearls are terrific, but if you plan on giving this as a gift - the box they come in could use some improvement. Otherwise the quality of the actual product is good. <end>  Beautiful bracelet!  The price was great. The bracelet came in withing about 3 days. The pearls were uniform, smooth, round and had a nice cream color. <end>
 B000MX3TYE  14k White Gold Diamond "Love" Charm (1/10 cttw) ||	  Very poor quality diamonds--dull and chipped!

 B000MZ7K5Q  Amethyst Hummingbird Silver and Enamel Pin by Zarah ||	  Amazing Hummingbird Pin!  I bought this pin for my mom for mother's day. She loves hummingbirds and I was trying to find something special for her. When she opened it, she cried. She loved it! It was absolutely beautiful and looked even better that on the website. (That rarely happens!) <end>  Wish it had been in a box  This is a nice pin, but don't expect it to be packaged in any type of box. I bought this as a present for a coworker, and had to find a box to put it in, before I could give it to her. It arrived in just a cheap plastic sleeve, which actually made the piece look like a cheap walmart pin. Once I found a decent box to put it in, it was more presentable as a gift. For the price, it should have been packaged a little better. <end>
 B000MZ8RPI  Black & Tan Dachshund Dog Sterling Silver and Enamel Earrings by Zarah ||	  BLACK AND TAN DACHSHUND EARRINGS  I PURCHASED THESE AS A PRESENT FOR MY SISTER WHO OWNS A BLACK AND TAN DACHSHUND.

So like how our sweet puppy looks and co-workers really like them! Thank you! <end>
 B000MZXPGY  10k White Gold Diamond Floating Teardrop Pendant (.08 cttw, H Color, I3 Clarity) ||	  Small  The teardrop is very small. So in this case you get what you pay for. It will be a nice little gift for a teen age girl. <end>
 B000N23ASY  CZ ENGAGEMENT RING - 14KGP Solitaire Center Baguette Sides CZ Engagement Ring Size 5 ||	  Fantastic service  The ring was too big, but I was able to exchange it for a smaller size with absolutely no trouble at all. I especially liked the fact that a real human would respond to my emails - and promptly, I might add - so much nicer than receiving an automated response that wouldn't take care of my specific issue! And the ring is beautiful - I would definitely order from them again. <end>
 B000N29RQS  10k Yellow Gold Round Diamond Channel Set Band (1/10 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  band ring  It is ok, not exactly like pictured. The diamonds sit deeper in the band than expected and are cloudy and do not shine like expected. The ring is nice for the price though. <end>  Don't be fooled by the picture  I got this ring hoping that it looks like the picture which was misleading. If you purchase this ring, please be aware that it is 1/10 cttw which means that the diamonds are really small. If you are a man looking to buy a ring for his significant other, I would recommend you spend it a little bit more and buy a better looking ring. I ended up returning it. <end>  Mother's day  This was on a Friday sale. I got it for 31.99 after the promotion and the sale. My mother loved it. It includes an envelope that had care and return information for the ring, too. <end>  Pretty and Dainty but not made very well  This is a very dainty ring. It was exactly what i was looking for. By the next day one of the diamonds were missing and by the end of the week three were missing. <end>  The picture looks better  The ring was pretty chincy once I saw it in person, the picture makes it look better than it really is. It was pretty thin at the base, it seemed it would be easy to break apart. I returned my purchase. <end>  Good Value for the Price  This band is as good a quality as many I have seen for twice the price. The stones are not set perfectly, nor are they of the finest quality but the band, as a whole is substantial and very nice looking. I liked the first one I ordered enough to order a second one. It is a very affordable option for anyone who is looking for a tasteful channel set band and will rival anything you can get on sale in a mainstream jewelry store. <end>  Pretty and small  I know this ring is inexpensive so I'm fine with what I recieved. I do have to say though that the picture makes the diamond channel appear to be visible - it is very thin and not as pretty as the picture might lead you to believe. All in all, as I said at first, it isn't pricey and the expectation should go along with that price - would work well for an adolescent, tweener, etc. <end>  Unexpected  -(  This was my 1st purchase from Amazon & it has shattered my expectations ...Coz it is very small compared what it looks like in its pic & you can't even see the diamonds in it  ( <end>
 B000N2BUPY  10k Yellow Gold Round Diamond Channel Set Band (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Diamonds are a girls best friend  I've been looking at other diamond bands and found these very well priced! They match so well with the diamond I bought at a pawn shop, that one would think they had all been part of a set! I am very happy.* One note of caution, these rings are sized a bit large, which works for me. They are probably a 7 1/2 <end>  diamond band  When I recieved this band I couldn't believe that the diamonds were as big as they are ! The price was right and the diamond band was better than I had hoped for, I really love it. <end>  Poor Quality  This ring is very poor quality. The diamonds are gray. Find something else to purchase. <end>  Better than I thought.  I bought this ring last year, we had planned to spend more on our wedding bands but then my mother became ill and we cancelled the big day. We ended up just going to the courthouse and signing the papers, but before that we were in a pinch to rush our rings! This one was the right price and decent quality. When I received it, I was pleasantly surprised, sure the diamonds aren't the best quality ever (hello, its a &lt;$100 diamond ring) but they were larger and better than I expected. I've worn it everyday for the last year and have yet to have to re-dip the gold, which is nice. Overall I'd do it again  ) <end>  good ring for the price  I was shopping last minute for a new ring and came upon exactly the style that I was looking for, at much less price than I anticipated spending. I would absolutely shop with them again. <end>  a little different than i expected  like previously mentioned, the rings are sized a bit large. the diamonds are not the best quality but for the price it is expected. you can't tell from the picture but the two strips of gold forming the channel for the diamonds actually sticks up a little. from the side the ring does not make a perfect circle but a slight oval shape. it's not necessarily bad, just different. My girlfriend really liked the ring, but if i had to do it again i would spend a little more money and get a ring of nicer quality. if you are planning on buying the ring, i suggest going a half size, maybe even a size smaller. <end>
 B000N2BUSQ  10k Yellow Gold Baguette Channel Set Diamond Band (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I2 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Diamond quality  I didn't like this product because the diamonds looked nothing like the picture. The diamonds are flawed more than a little bit. <end>
 B000N4COPC  White Twisted Silver Cultured Pearl Necklace Bracelet Earrings Set ||	  Beautiful Pearls  I purchased this for myself with gift cards I received for christmas. Wow! Very impressive! Pearls are lustrous, and craftmanship is top noch. The bracelet is sized to actually fit a womans wrist with one silver heart and a smaller gold heart located at the clasp, making the braclet look continuous without the clasp breaking up the flow of pearls. The necklace is choker length with an extender, and the earrings hit right at the curve of the chin line; a perfect frame to your face. The entire set is simply amazing; regal, sophisicated, and very feminine. I've worn this set with my jeans and heels, and of course dressier attire. It is perfectly versatile!Whether a gift for yourself or someone special this will be a purchase you praise yourself for making. Also, Dahlia sent my items very fast; 2 days. Buy confidently. I am already looking for more items from this seller for gifts! <end>  Better than the picture!  I got this for my wife, she had it on her wish list... and Holy cow! This is a lot nicer in person than these pictures show for sure! <end>
 B000N4U4CW  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Martini Pendant (.07 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Very cute and sparkly!  I received this as an anniversary gift and it is very petite and cute, easily placed on a favorite necklace. This is a great piece to wear on a night on the town! <end>  awesome!  I just received this today for my 37th anniversary gift. After that many years, I'm allowed to order what I want- so I knew I would LOVE it!!! Amazon did a great job of tracking the delivery of my order. I knew it should arrive today, but hadn't. I tracked it around 2pm and it stated that a delivery attempt was made at 12 57 and no one was available to sign for it, and another attempt would be made tomorrow. I was mad, as we're leaving out of town tomorrow, and I wanted to wear my anniversary gift! I printed out the tracking memo, and found the dumby UPS guy within minutes, and got my beautiful pendent! It's soooooo adorable. I have a number of pendents which I interchange with a very thich chain after having to have a thin one soldered too many times. The pendent would not fit on the thick gold chain. I went to the local jeweler to make it work. He tried, but couldn't, as my chain was too thick, and it wouldn't lay correctly if it was altered. Fortunately, I still had my old thin gold chain, and it fit perfectly. Thanks Amazon, you have a very happy customer! You give a good quality product for a good price, and back it up with quality service. Love, love, love my diamond and gold martini necklace. It's much cuter than the one I saw at [...], and the price was much better. Cheers!!! Carolyn <end>

 B000N58GGW  10k White Gold 3-Stone Diamond Pendant (1/8 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  disappointed  I found the pendant to be much smaller than it appeared on the web site. The chain was also in a knot when it arrived so I was never able to even try it on. <end>  Very pretty  but also very dainty. I am surprised anyone would make jewelry on a chain as tiny as this one, but it is a very pretty necklace. Just tiny. <end>  Very nice surprise  It got here fast. Not only that, it was just as decribed online. I love it! <end>
 B000N5OU5S  Traditional Style 5mm Two-Tone 14 Karat Gold Comfort Fit Wedding Band Ring ||	  Beautiful ring and excellent service  My fianc&eacute;e ordered this ring as my wedding band. It is very nice and "simple".. just what I was wanting. Should note that it appears slightly different from the picture.. the edges and interior appear silver in pic, however it's gold. Arguably nicer looking than shown. Also, after trying it on a couple times over several weeks prior to the wedding I decided it was too large (my bad)... Exchange was very quick and painless. <end>

 B000N5ZVS8  14k Gold Black Diamond Stud Earrings ||	  One of them might be fake will update shortly  I got these earring as a amazon deal of the day. Took out the diamond tester to test if they are real diamonds. One of them beeps to signal it is a genuine diamond. The other earring says it made out of some other material. It give off the sound of metal. I did the test numerous times on these earrings as well as check to see if the diamond tester was working... I think its a classic bait and switch. Im going to take it to a diamond expert to double check <end>  Black diamond stud earrings a sparkling success  The black diamond studs on a yellow gold backing & supports are very beautiful. I wear yellow gold & most times it is difficult to get what I want in yellow gold. The display on the internet of the black diamond studs with corresponding measurements of the stone meant I knew what I was getting & so was delighted when they arrived. You can wear them casually or for a more dressed up occasion. <end>  weak sauce  Arrived with at least one overt defect  a scratch on the surface or an inner defect. Was hoping to get them just exchanged for an undamaged pair, but return policy said I could only get money back...which matters because then the price went up. I guess there is not quality control for this stuff? Weak sauce, amazon. weak sauce. If you order jewelry from amazon, you should probably have a gemologist friend to make sure you're not getting gypped... <end>  Stunning 2 ct Black Diamond earrings  Theses was a great price for 2 ct tw 14ct gold black diamond earrings and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice pair of earrings! You can pay this for Sterling Sliver but for this price your actually getting 14 kt gold! Great Deal and beautiful on, not to large or too small; just right and if you have a second piercing in your ear these would be perfect for that as well! I know when I got my earrings I was not disappointed at all, beautiful earrings that I know I will get alot of wear and enjoyment from. <end>  Size Matters  I returned the items without any inconvenience. There is nothing wrong with product. The earings seemed bigger when I placed the order. I will continue to order other items from Amazom.com. <end>  Beautiful!  I love these earrings. They are large and sparkle beautifully, I receive many compliments on them. I was delighted to find these as it is difficult to find black diamonds in yellow gold settings. The posts are sturdy but I had to replace the earring backs as they were too small to support the weight of the earring, thus the 4 star rating. <end>  very disappointed  extremely disappointed...order this item as a christmas gift already knowing that black diamonds are much smaller than white diamonds, however, these are more like 1/4 carat each not even close to 1/2 carat each. do not waste your money on these earrings they are not at all worth it...will be sending them back for a refund... <end>  Waste of Money  A bit disappointed with this item, the backing is a bit loose and on several occasions, it fell off easily. Furthermore, I do not see much sparkle in this item. Does not do justice to the amount spent. <end>  earrings  I was happy with the stone size, but the settings were rather chinzy. The backs are really small, and dig into your ear lobe, but once I put better backs on them, they were fine. <end>  Durable, Beautiful, great value  Bought these for my wife for Christmas. She has multiple holes in her ears (as in two on one side, three on the other), and we've been married for over fifteen years. But, she doesn't wear jewelry much anymore.But ya know what's cool? She hasn't taken these out since I sprang them on her in mid December as an "early Christmas Gift." I love seeing them in her ears, and she loves having them there. I don't know what better recommendation one can give?We had a "Christmas Gala" and she combined them with a string of black pearls, and she looked great! <end>  Black Diamond Earrings  Gave them 4 stars because we liked them but they are definitely NOT 1 carat or 1/2 carat each. <end>  my son loves these  The only thing that would make these better woulld be a screw back. They arre beautifull and I may just purchase a pari for myself ) <end>  black diamond studs for composite earrings  I PURCHASED THESE STUDS TO COMPLETE A SET. I HAD PREVIOUSLY BOUGHT A BLACK DIAMOND CENTERED, WHITE DIAMOND CIRCLE DROP AND COULD NOT FIND A SUITABLE SET OF BLACK DIAMOND EAR RINGS TO MATCH. MY WIFE ALREADY HAD A SET OF DIAMOND RING JACKETS WHICH ARE PERFECT FOR THESE STUDS. THE COMPLETED SET IS VERY PRETTY AND EFFECTIVE JEWELRY.CHARLIBART <end>  1 cttw Black diamonds  This diamond earrings are much smaller than I expected. I have white diamonds that are 1 cttw. and these are so much smaller. I have the 1/2 cttw. and they are almost the same size. <end>  14K White gold Balck Diamond Stud Earring (.5cttw)  I think Amazon needs a &#34;life-size&#34; photo when they offer these deals. Even though they clearly stated .5cttw I wasn't prepared for just how small that would be. Looking at the photo in the ad it appeared they would be an acceptable size.I returned the item. <end>  Black Diamond Earrings  Did not like the Black Diamond Earrings. They are supposed to be 14K but did not look like it. Returned them. <end>  Not quite as expected  I purchased these for my wife but was really disappointed. She expected diamonds of any kind to be translucent but these have none. The could be a couple of chunks of obsidian. Not sure I will buy jewerly on-line again. <end>  not disappointed  NICE PIECE OF JEWELRY, GOOD PRICE, BETTER THEN EXPECTED. BEST TO STAY IN THE 3/4 TO 1CTw SIZE. WILL PURCHASE THE 1CT PENDANT TO MATCH AND MAKE IT A SET. <end>  earrings  The earrings were shown to be a little larger than they really were, so in the future know what a carrot really looks like. <end>  Amazon Cheats Customers  When I ordered these I noticed there were negative reviews regarding customers not getting what they ordered and payed for. However because Amazon continues to do business with this vendor and continues to stake their reputation on selling this product I thought I would take the chance and order these earrings.WRONG DECISION!!! DO NOT ORDER THESE EARRINGS!! DO NOT TRUST AMAZON!! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN TO ANOTHER STORE!!Amazon knows they have bad reviews and they know this vendor is cheating people and stealing their money and yet Amazon continues to do business with this crooked vendor and continues to help cheat consumers.Amazon SUCKS AND THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED!!! <end>  Poor Product  I was very disaponted in these earings. They were very small and not worth the price. They listed that they originally soldfor $715. If that was the case, they should have had a certificate of authenticity. Needless to say I have returned them.Anne C.Warwick, RI <end>  Birthday Gift  I bought this item for a birthday gift. It was hard for me to give them away  ) <end>  Product OK  I am satisified with this product....ordered it with 2 others for Valentines day and this is the only product that made it <end>  Black Diamonds  Does anyone really realize what they're buying here? Black diamonds are really crappy diamonds that have been placed in a nuclear reactor. The black color results from the diamonds being bombarded by intense neutron radiation. This makes the diamonds radioactive, and have to be stored until their radioactivity dies out. Only then are they sent to market. The main point here, however, is you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear--in other words, "Garbage in, garbage out." <end>  A good value purchase  I purchased these for my wife and she loves them. When they arrived, I thought they were smaller than one carat each. I took them to my local jeweler and he confirmed they were each one carat. The black diamonds appear smaller than their one carat white counterparts. These are very attractively priced. <end>  Tough to go Wrong with These  I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas, and I received just what was advertised on Amazon. The stones themselves were nice and a good size, since they were 2 CTTW, the total weight would have been 1 Carat per earring, I believe.They came a little smudged in the nice blue suede jewelry box, but it seemed like fingerprints, and I was able to wipe off the smudges on the diamonds. The shine in the light is very nice because they are not as flashy as white diamonds, but have a cool, black shine in the light that is not blinding but still attractive.My girlfriend had never seen black diamonds before, so she was not only surprised, but she absolutely loves them. The benefit is that she can wear these earrings with a dress for a formal occasion, or she can wear them casually when going out with friends. The 14k white gold setting is nice to look at, and a clean setting in the pair we received.I went out on a limb for Christmas to buy a gift I was not sure if she would like, and it was a great success! <end>  Disappointing  I was excited to receive these earrings at such a great price and with such great reviews. However, I was filled with disappointment once I received them. One of the diamonds is chipped on the side and the other has a hazy water spot stain right in the middle of it. On top of that, the diamonds have hardly any luster or sparkle. Needless to say, they are being returned. <end>  Black diamond earrings.  The product was pretty much what I thought it would be and I'm satisfiedwith the transaction, etc.. My wife is pleased with the earrings. They were delivered on time and there were no problems. <end>  horrible, complete rip off  I was a bit concerned about buying jewelry online but decided to give it a try. I had originally purchased some smaller diamonds and was satisfied with them, but returned them because they were too small. I decided to go with larger diamonds and was extremely dissapointed when they arrived. The clasps were both bent and scratched. The stones themselves were severely scratched and worn. I swear it looked like someone went to an arts and crafts store, bought some supplies and threw together some cheap earrings. I will never be ordering jewelry online again. Complete waste of time and money. <end>  Love these!  I love these earrings and wear them nearly everyday. The only review that had me concerned was some said they were small for being 1 carrot but I don't feel the same. I have smaller diamonds in my other holes and these look huge compared to them. I am not that versed in how big a carrot should be but I am very satisfied with the size. <end>  Great Earrings!  I purchased these earrings a few weeks ago and they are exactly as expected. I love them for every day wear. This was my first purchase of amazon jewelry and it was a positive experience. <end>  Pretty!  I bought the 2 ctw black diamonds and they are very pretty. I thought they might come with information telling what their cut and clarity are but they do not. Overall, glad I purchased them. <end>  black diamonds ear rings  I gave them to my wife for Valentines day. She loved them. They were just as describe with beautiful black diamonds in a 14 ct setting. They were package well in a nice display box. <end>  Great gift  Received this as a Christmas present from my husband and absolutley love them! Great size and stunning color not to mention the setting is beautiful. <end>  If you think these are small, please read!  I love black diamonds, and have three pairs of earrings of different sizes, all bought online. I've noticed that several reviewers here were surprised that these 1cttw black diamonds are smaller than expected. Please note before you buy, so you don't end up disappointed -#1  These earrings are advertised as 1 CTTW, meaning 1 Carat TOTAL Weight. In other words, each stone is approximately 1/2 carat, for a total combined weight of 1 carat. As anyone who has bought jewelry online before can tell you, stud earrings are usually advertised this way.-#2  Black diamonds are naturally denser than white diamonds, and therefore weigh more (about 1/3 more). Thus, a 1 ct black diamond will be approximately the same size as a 2/3 ct white diamond. Many online sellers provide the stone's diameter in millimeters as well as the carat weight. It would be very helpful if Amazon would list measurements on their stones as well, but until they catch on, just keep the weight difference in mind when buying black diamonds.One more thing for those complaining about the price, I priced a pair of earrings similar to these at Boscov's this weekend, just to see how good a deal I got. Boscov's regular price on 1 cttw black diamonds in 14k gold was $799.00, but they were on sale for $391.00. Compared to that, Amazon's price is a steal, as long as you know what you're buying.Those who do their homework beforehand are rarely disappointed with their purchases.Happy Holidays! <end>  Disappointment  These diamonds resembled faceted hematite which costs a fraction of this pair. Not at all what was expected; post was also bent when received.UPDATE  I have since purchased black diamond studs which are gorgeous and far superior to these in construction and quality of the settings and the stones. Nice black diamonds are truly lovely, especially in white gold settings and I'd recommend getting at least the 1cttw to really show off the dark beauty. As with white diamonds, the closer in match of the pair, the better, and the pair I'd originally received were on all counts inferior stones as was the setting. <end>  A Good Deal  I bought the earrings from the Ligntning Deal for $129.99. It's a real bargain. The black diamond is shiny and has a good reflection. I love the earrings very much. The size is perfect for me. Please keep in mind that the black diamond has a small table top. Even the total weight is 2 ct the table top is much smaller than other diamonds. <end>  Excited but then dissappointed...  I was very excited when I found these but when I received them I was dissappointed as the (1) earring had a large inclusion on the surface. Posts were nice and the settings as well. Had it not been for the inclusion in the (1) earring I would have given this 5 stars all the way.I did return the items and re-ordered.I will update as I am VERY excited about these earrings. <end>  Nice Size and Quality  I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift for my wife, and she really liked them. The stones were a nice size and cut very well. The stones are not quite as dark as pictured, more of a dark gray rather than black, but still a nice color. <end>  great buy  the black diamond stud earring are more than I expected. They have a rich look, and good shine. <end>  Diamond in the Ruff  These earrings are beautiful! The color, clarity & size are perfect. I was extremely pleased with my purchase! I wish they came in yellow gold. <end>  Total Rip Off -- Deserves Zero Stars  I did not expect high quality stones due to the price, but I certainly didn't expect such horrible quality.Both stones and dull and extremely cloudy. They also have huge inclusions right on their surfaces. They are gray in color (not close to black as shown in the picture). One is darker than the other. Even though their color would hide most flaws, the quality is so obviously poor it would be embarrassing for anyone to wear them.I also would like to note that the white gold settings are not as shown in the picture. The stones are propped up on top of settings so the white gold cannot be seen on the perimeter when viewed directly from the front.I ordered them a couple of days ago but now when I view the item, it says "Item under review" due to customer feedback. I'm guessing other customers have complained about being sent two lumps of coal too!!Returning immediately. Not worth more than $10. You're better off buying something made of plastic from a bead store. <end>  Great gift, great price  I was very pleased with the earrings. You would be hard pressed to beat the price. We ordered some of these for my mother in law and a pair for my wife. The only thing to complain about was the pair for my mother in law did not come in a jewelery box and the pair for my wife did, weird but no big deal. <end>  made my wife happy  I knew that my wife looked at these earrings by the browsing history,so I thought I'd surprise her and order them for a gift. She was delighted,and they look very nice on her. (pat on back for me) I am not a jewelery expert,but I cannot see a thing wrong with them. They look very expensive,which they were not. Great deal on a beautiful pair of earings. I also upgraded shipping to 2nd day air. The earrings arrived at my door in 17hrs.from the time of ordering. AMAZING!! Thank you UPS and Amazon. I just might get lucky tonight. <end>  I love my earrings  I love these earrings; I could not have been more pleased. I have had them for almost one year and I am still happy my purchase. <end>  Completely Unsatisfied  I have already sent these back to the seller. When I received these earrings, they looked like they had been scratched and along the prongs it looked as if there was glue, or maybe they were just really dirty. Either way I returned them within 10 minutes of receiving them. I later found out that Black Diamonds are just that way, unless you buy high quality, basically flaweless, this is what you can expect to see. With that said, these earrings were too flawed for me to give to my wife. I thought for the price it was a steal, but turned out to be too good to be true. On a positive there wasn't any hassle with returning these. <end>  Simple Yet Stunning  These earrings are wonderful. I purchased a pair for my birthday and I LOVE them. I always get compliments on them, in fact my mom, sister-in-law, and best friend now own a pair too. The only downside is that jewelry makers often put black diamonds with white gold so it's kind of difficult to find complimentary pieces, although I have managed to find matching pieces over time. <end>  Great Black Diamond Earrings  Bought these as a Christmas present for my wife. She loves them. They were as described and delivered very quickly. The black diamonds look great. Great value for the price. <end>  Beautiful!!  Great quality. Size,cut,color,mounting,all super. Hard to find in yellow gold mounts-Surprisingly nice presentation box was a real gift time plus.Only con is they would be even nicer with screwback posts but post & friction will do.. Still 5 stars! <end>  1st set not so good, pleased with 2nd set  1st set arrived and had visible imperfections in the stones. The surface was fine, it was something within the stones themselves. The box was dirty too so maybe it was a previously returned set and they tried to drop it on me? Not sure... Returned and bought another set. Taking into account the price I paid, $249, I am pleased with the 2nd set and will be giving to my girlfriend for Christmas along with a matching pendant. <end>  Love them!  This is a great pair of earrings at a great steal, I mean deal!  ) They can easily be dressed up or down....I've worn my everyday since they arrived! <end>  Excellent quality. Solid setting.  I was very impressed with the studs. I've never purchased anything from Amazon and was disappointed. The setting is solid, and although Black Diamonds don't have the " glitter " that clear diamonds have, they are noticed. Plus,with the color of stone, they go with every outfit that you wear. Delivery was excellent, displayed in a heavy box for safe-keeping. <end>  Small!  I was able to take advantage of a deep discounted sale on these. I knew not to expect much, but I've never seen a black diamond before, so I was intrigued.When I got the earrings, they looked ok (I plan to add some diamond jackets in the future), but way smaller than anticipated. I really don't think the "1 cttw" is accurate. 1/2 ct stones are larger than these. In any case, you do get what you pay for, and they seem to be a fair value at the price I paid. At full price, these babies would have taken a round trip! <end>  Needs better backing  These earrings are pretty - not the depth and sparkle I hoped for but I like how they look on me.For a stud earring this size, I feel that the backing clip should've been more adequate - and maybe evena screw on style to secure the earrings. I ended up finding some larger backings for them out of my jewelrybox. I may return them. Not sure. <end>  Beautiful earrings at beautiful price  The earrings are beautiful, favorite pieces of my wife. The price is great. There is nothing to "not like" about this purchase. Very pleased. <end>  Black Diamonds  I was very pleased with the earrings themselves. The diamonds are very black and sparkly. The only concern I have is the backing for the studs. They should have been a little larger to support the weight of the earrings. I own a pair of diamond studs about the same size and the backing on them are appropriate to the earring. <end>  Black Diamond earrings  These earrings seem small for one crt each. It could be the darker color. I was expecting them to be broader. If you are looking for black diamonds, the cut and setting are a nice quality, just be aware of the surface size. <end>  BLACK DIAMONDS ARE DENSER/APPEAR SMALLER  The stones are black, but unlike onyx, they are clear at their depths. Today, I went shopping around jewelry stores for 1cttw black diamond studs. I had these earrings in tow...for comparison. The average price for a 1cttw black diamond stud is 400. None of the earrings I saw were as sparkling as these. While many reviewers seem unhappy about these earrings's size, I'll tell you, all of the 1cttw studs I saw today, were smaller than these. Really. I was mildly shocked.I don't know much about black diamonds, but I have learned they are denser than white diamonds. In appearance, they are quite a bit smaller than white diamonds of the same carat weight. On average, they are not perfect and under the loupe imperfections become obvious. My earrings do have some imperfections than can be seen when magnified, but the beauty and sparkle of these stones are not affected. The closest analogy I can make is  White clothing shows dirt and imperfections directly to the eye. Black clothing may not be pristine, but the beauty of the clothing is unaffected, and most often, the imperfections cannot be seen by the eye.These are beautiful earrings. Highly reflective and sparkling. The 14k setting is sturdy and Amazon's price is fantastic....crazy good! They have their own unique beauty and really cannot be compared to white diamonds in size or grading. On the ears, the imperfections in these stones do not diminish their beauty. These are beautiful, black, sparkling beauties. I'm glad to have them. UPDATE  I get so many compliments on these earrings. Often, I'm asked; "What kind of stone is that?" <end>  Did alot of research and these are the best  I checked around a lot of places for these exact earrings. It was hard to find black diamonds with yellow gold, but these were to celebrate the Saints winning the Superbowl so it had to be black and gold. I am very happy with the purchase. My girlfriend, who is not a big jewelry person, is also very happy with these.The diameter is perfect, but if you want to get really choosy I would say they stick out from the ear a little too much. I guess that this is a problem with getting 2 carrots. A lesser carrot with the same problem would be even more noticeable if it is the same height. That is the only thing bad I have to say and that is being really critical.Overall I am very happy with this purchase. Any serious flaws in the diamonds are not noticeable because they are black. I must admit that I am not a jeweler though. <end>  Black Diamond Stud Earrings  They look better on the picture than they do when you receive them. Very small but will use them in the second pierced whole in my ear, not as the main earring since they are so small. <end>  lovely earrings  My husband bought me these earrings for our anniversary.Pros  From the picture, I thought they would be a little old-fashioned, but they are very stylish and go with everything, from dressy to casual. They look elegant but not flashy. The size is perfect; I wouldn't recommend ordering the smaller size.Cons  There is a little ding on the side of one of the stones (not that I expect anyone to get close enough to my ear to notice!), and I wish the earrings had come with some sort of certificate of authenticity or diamond rating card. <end>  pleasantly surprised  After doing a little research and discovering that black diamonds tend to be smaller than white (they weigh more) I ordered the two carat tw studs. They look great and have a nice sparkle. The price was very resonable, well worth the money. They are a nice size and don't appear too small on the ear as some studs can. These would be great for dressing up or casual. <end>  GORGEOUS!!!!  I ordered this for my girlfriend after GREAT disappointment in a pair at ZALES! This earring are stunning...clear...the perfect size and style. I recommend them for anyone looking for a great pair of black diamond earrings! <end>  Very Satisfied  I have never purchased jewelry from Amazon before, only books and electronics. I normally buy jewelry online from Tiffany for my wife. The earrings were very nice and my wife was very pleased. The size and quality were as promised. No complaints! <end>  Good Value  The diamonds I got were nice and clean. My wife loves them she just developed an allergy against silver jewelry so these are great. <end>  Very pretty!  They are just the right size. Sparkle when they catch the light and have a good length post. Very pretty. <end>  One Stone arrived chipped and hairline scratches in the other (4cttw earrings)  The edges of one of the two stones has fractures in the surface that are detectible by both sight and touch. Both stones have visible hairline scratches in the surface, indicating poor polishing technique. Total cost in this condition should be sub 30-40 dollars.I am willing to accept that these may not be absolutely 100% tip top perfect, but the cut needs to eliminate any and all obvious physical occlusions and cracks from the outside surface. In this case the cut speaks to poorly trained/motivated diamond work. I will be returning these and making a second attempt for a new set before giving up, just in case I received a bum set. <end>  Guess You get what You pay for...  The table of each earring had multiple inclusions (inclusion is a characteristic enclosed within a gemstone), I returned one set as they were so bad the inclusions dominated the table - the 2nd set was a bit better but far from what I would classify as &#34;good&#34; <end>  small but nice  Very pretty and nicely made. It is important to remember that diamonds are sold by weight, and black diamonds are heavier than other kinds. So these are small, but quite nice. <end>  I had one that was bent and there wasn't as much shine as I was hoping for. I would not have paid full price  I had one that was bent and there wasn't as much shine as I was hoping for. I would not have paid full price <end>  Nice gift for a nice price  The earrings and 14 carat gold setting appear to be quite nice. The gift boxing is lacking style in placement of the earrings in the box, and the size of the box is awkwardly large, but the merchandise quality appears to be very nice for the price. <end>  Black Diamond Ear rings  You get what you pay for. The first set I received had visible cracks. I returned them and the next set was better. My wife didn't like them so I ultimately returned that set as well. <end>  I love it..  Its my first oversees gift from my boyfriend on my birthday .. I am just loving it .. Its very special for me.. Its just beautiful .. and black makes it wearble with all the attires.. I just love it.. <end>  Stud earrings for daughter  I bought two sets of stud earrings for my daughter on Amazon and this was the best. The earrings were larger than I thought and sparkling. They were very noticeable and looked great. The price was terrific. <end>  Very Pleased!  After a less than satisfactory experience with ZALES (who shipped me 1/2 cttw earrings twice when I paid for 3/4 cttw and the first pair were broken)So, I turned to Amazon. The earrings are a great cut, they sparkle in the light. The surface is smaller than expected, but the spacing of 4 prong set helps give it a fuller look. The only thing I would suggest would be to add a screw on back....But, overall I am very satisfied with the item and the price!! <end>  great purchase  I bought my earrings not knowing what to expect, and after receiving them, I find I want to wear them all the time. I love them, and can't wait to find more pieces to go with it. <end>  Black diamond earrings are wonderful  I was a bit apprehensive at first due to previous reviews but when I saw the earrings, I was VERY pleased. They were beautiful and had a wonderful sparkle to them. I was afraid they would be dull but you need not worry. They are beautiful and well worth the price. <end>  as advertised  More dark grey than black -but they are very nice and I enjoy wearing them. The settings are moderatly strong-better than most! <end>  Earings fell to bits  I brought this item as a gift.only 2 months old from gift date. The diamond fell out when the person wore it the second time. Now it's impossible to get it refunded or swapped for another pair. Where is the contact information ? <end>  Elegant jewelry  I returned a pair of black diamond studs (that were actually less expensive than these) but decided to take a chance on ordering them again, since other reviewers made me think it was a matter of chance to get a "good" pair. I'm very glad I did. The second pair are shallower and a little wider, though still 2 cttw, and are much more sparkly and clearer. They are still black, but seem to reflect from colors around, or from what else I am wearing. I really like them. <end>  Nice for the price and quality  Great looking and solid. DO not expect the flash that you get with regular diamonds. These are unique! I got them in white gold. <end>  Black Diamond Stud Earings  These were ok..large stones set in nice white gold. They were so black they were completly opaque. Compared to other ones I had seen at a jewelry store these almost looked fake. But these cost 1/10 of what the ones in store do. I would give them 3 stars but I don't know squat about diamonds...but the wife liked them and wears them regualy...so I am giving it a 4 ! <end>  Black Diamonds  My girlfriend loves them! I haven't seen them myself yet as I'm in Afghanistan but she said they are beautiful! <end>  Sorely disappointed.  The price was too good to be true. One of the earrings had a chip in it and the other had a cloudy stain on it. They also lacked brilliance and sparkle. I returned them, sorely disappointed. <end>
 B000N62HIO  10k Yellow Gold Diamond Bridal Set (1/5 cttw, I-J Color, I2 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  My new rings for our 34th Wedding Anniversary  My new rings are really pretty.....I'm very happy with my purchase. I work with my hands a lot, and because the center stone is setting higher than I realized it would, I'm concerned that I may catch in on something and damage it. I'm having to remember to take them off to prevent that from happening.This set reminds me of my original wedding rings that were purchased in 1973. They also overlaped....I like the unique shape. <end>  Great Ring, Great Price  The ring is actually very beautiful up close, although the diamonds don't look as big, but they do stand out, especially the one in the middle. If your not careful you can really scratch someone up with this ring, but very much worth the price. I haven't seen any green or anything around my finger as of yet!!! <end>  A Very Good Deal!  The ring does look very pretty when you see it in person...The diamonds are small but very nice looking...I bought it as a replacement anniversary ring for my wife & so far (after a month) nothing's wrong with it...Looks well made/durable & yeah the top diamond sticks out quite a bit (just a warning) but other than than a very excellent deal considering the good price tag. <end>  Great Buy!  This is a gorgeous ring for such a low price. I absolutely love it. It came in the mail very quickly too! <end>  Cool Ring  I bought this ring for my g/f, it looks great on her hand and most of all she loves it. It has 17 diamonds in all and its and odd 2-piece ring. Nevertheless uniqueness is greatness. Beware though, its yellow gold....so its a tiny bit dull compared to a shiny gold. Its a good buy, oh, but the centre diamond could give you a bruise if someone else passes their hand, ah ha.don't touch. Great ring! <end>
 B000N62HK2  14k White Gold Diamond Bridal Set (1/3 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  just so you know....  From a distance, this is a beautiful ring. On closer inspection however, you will see while the marquise diamond is acceptable, the baguettes are chipped, cracked and broken. Furthermore, while the page indicates the ring may be adjusted up or down one size, I could find no way to specify the size I desired and because I paid with a credit card could not do so by email. I do plan to keep the ring, but my jeweler said there is a good possibility, due to the condition of the stones, they will need to be replaced in the future. <end>
 B000N6381O  14k Rose Gold Diamond Butterfly Ring (0.05 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 8 ||	  Beautiful ring  I love the simplicity of this beautiful ring. It's stunning. This was the first piece of jewelry I have ever ordered online and I was not disappointed. <end>  Butterfly Ring  I bought this ring for my daughter for her high school graduation, it is very pretty but small. I thought from the picture it would be larger? My daughter loved it so I guess all is well, but I think that these rings should be shown at actual size. <end>
 B000N6517S  14k White Gold Diamond Butterfly Ring (0.05 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 9 ||	  Beautiful ring  I love the simplicity of this beautiful ring. It's stunning. This was the first piece of jewelry I have ever ordered online and I was not disappointed. <end>  Butterfly Ring  I bought this ring for my daughter for her high school graduation, it is very pretty but small. I thought from the picture it would be larger? My daughter loved it so I guess all is well, but I think that these rings should be shown at actual size. <end>
 B000N66KKA  14k White Gold Hoop Earrings (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Love these earrings!  These earrings are becoming my favorite. They are small and neat, and unlike the previous reviewer, I have had no problem with losing them. In fact, several times I have forgotten to take them out before pulling a sweater off over my head. They always stay in place. Also, I love the ease of putting them on, no tiny backs to mess with! <end>  Waste of money! not worth it  Well I bought this earring because there is additional 20% that day, well I wore it for a day and went to sleep it fell off the bed and my baby got it into her mouth, I was horrified luckily I got it on time before she can swallow it, the backing of this earring is hollow that's why it's easy to lose it, it could fall off while you touch your hair.....I lost the other earring again and nowhere to find...I only had them for mere 1 week, don't buy this earring buy something expensive which you know will last longer, craftmaship is cheap! <end>
 B000N66NTI  10k White Gold 2-Stone Split-Bale Diamond Ring (0.08 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Great buy!  I bought this as a promise ring for my girl friend and she liked it very much. The two diamonds look very good. The ring is simple but beautiful at the same time and for the price, it is a great buy indeed. <end>  Great Promise Ring  I gave this to my girlfriend as a promise ring and she loved it. The diamonds are extremely tiny, but that works well with a promise ring. The ring is very pretty and very well made. <end>  Nice ring  This is a very nice little ring for the price. Makes a nice promise ring, but I bought it because it was very dainty looking and I wanted it as a pinkie ring. I give it 5 stars because it met what I wanted and more for the price . . very pretty. <end>  Perfect Christmas Present  My mom bought me this ring as a christmas present two years ago and I absolutely love it. It is very small, but it works out because it is discrete, and pops when you look at it. Mine is still shiny and looks brand new, so this ring wears very well. I am looking for a new ring for my other hand, but I wear this ring everyday. This ring is not only perfect for a girlfriend, but it's also perfect for a daughter. <end>  Love This Ring!  Let me start this review by saying - I planned on just having a plain wedding band for my wedding ring. I've never been a fan if big giant diamonds and I am also prone to losing jewelry and snagging it on stuff and breaking it. I came across this ring on Amazon and decided to change from the plain wedding band, to this. The item arrived quickly and in a nice blue velvet box. Its adorable! Its perfect if you want an understated ring and if giant diamonds aren't your thing. The diamonds are nested in the setting so they aren't raised and won't snag on anything. For the price of the ring they are bigger than I expected them to be, and very sparkly and beautiful! The ring itself is also very shiny, the fit was perfect. This is one purchase where I feel like I got more than I paid for, which doesn't happen very often! Since I have been wearing it people have commenting on how nice it is, noticing it before I even show it to them. That should tell you how good it looks. People also think it was very expensive. I am very happy with this purchase. I can't wait for my wedding now! <end>  Perfect fit  This ring is petite, charming, and sparkly. It doesn't draw too much attention to itself, but it remains beautiful. Shipping was quick, and it arrived in a beautiful ring box.I only have 1 small issue with it. It seems one of the diamonds has a small chip on it, and tends to catch itself on random clothing fuzz sometimes. This makes me concerned over the quality of the diamonds, but I got it on sale ($40) so it doesn't concern me that much. Be aware of it if you buy it full price though. <end>  Great Ring  Bought it for the fiance and she loved it. She couldn't be happier with any other ring and the only downside is it needs to be resized now but thats not the fault of anyone. <end>
 B000N66QJ0  14k White Gold Diamond Butterfly Ring (0.05 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Beautiful ring  I love the simplicity of this beautiful ring. It's stunning. This was the first piece of jewelry I have ever ordered online and I was not disappointed. <end>  Butterfly Ring  I bought this ring for my daughter for her high school graduation, it is very pretty but small. I thought from the picture it would be larger? My daughter loved it so I guess all is well, but I think that these rings should be shown at actual size. <end>
 B000N6AQ6O  14k White Gold Round and Baguette Diamond Ring (3/8 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  Way too small  Ring is way too small and looks like a toy when putting it on. I would not recommend if you want a nice 1/2 carat ring. <end>  beautiful diamond band!  i bought this ring as a wedding band and i was pleasantly surprised-- it is truly beautiful. it's super sparkley and much less ostentatious than it might appear. it looks perfect with my engagement ring! the only problem is that i have to wait 5 months before i can wear it.... <end>
 B000N6AQ7I  Men's 14k Yellow Gold Black and White Diamond Ring (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 10 ||	  Ring  Have not had ring sized yet. Will review to make sure it doesn't bend like last ring I bought. <end>  INCORRECT DESCRIPTION  Look! I know this ring is NOT available at this time, but as long as you have it listed you should tell the truth about it. I bought this ring from Amazon in 2007, and there is NO WHITE GOLD anywhere on it. That's just a photo-illusion. Plus, there are ONLY 30 DIAMONDS on it, not 34 as listed. You can count them yourself from the picture. Either CORRECT the description, or remove this item entirely from the listings. Thanks! <end>
 B000N87Y0S  Sterling Silver Amber Butterfly Animal Drop Earrings ||	  I loved these earrings!!!  I bought these earrings a couple of weeks ago...They arrived SO quickly and I was so pleasantly surprised!I don't think the picture does them justice. The hooks are amazing (and ALSO sterling silver, not just surgical steel) and the butterflies are just perfect.They are so well-made... excellent workmanship and quality materials.I thought they'd be a tiny bit smaller, though. My only criticism is that I wish I could have seen a picture of them being worn by a real model.Other than that, I really love them and wear them all the time!!  o) <end>
 B000N8LA9Y  Round Larimar Ring, 7.5 ||	  Beautiful Piece  I was very happy with how quickly I received this shipment. The ring itself is also gorgeous. <end>
 B000N8XHDQ  10k Yellow Gold Round Pave Diamond Hoop Earrings (1/2 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Too small for me  Although I bought these earrings at an unbelivable low price--they were way to small for me. In the picture they look wider than they actually are. They are just a tad bigger than huggies and not as wide, so I sent them back. If you like prettty small earrings--these will be perfect for you. They shined very nicely. <end>
 B000N8ZC20  14k White Gold Pave Diamond Ring (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 8 ||	  When they say white they mean it...  Good- nice band, no scratches, feels heavy.Bad- Cloudy white diamonds, one had a big black speck, not even close to clear diamonds...When they say "white diamonds" that is precisely what they mean. The description of the diamonds (H-I color and I2 clarity) is accurate in the ad, the photo (I feel)showed clear diamonds and was not accurate. If you are looking to impress anyone who knows anything about diamonds go to a real jeweler and spend the bucks.I am using this as an everyday wedding band to "replace" my original wedding set. My engagement ring use to catch on everything and this one does not. Now I can put my hand in my pocket without it snagging on the flap for instance. As a lefty the bulky wedding set was a nuisance.This is a good item for everyday wear. I don't have to worry if I lose it or damage it because it was so inexpensive. Basically, I calculated the value of the gold (I figured the diamonds as worthless) and the price (on special sale) was less then that so I really couldn't go wrong here.Additionally, if the seller doesn't provide the weight of the gold (without the gems), karat (10,14,18), and the minimum clarity and color of the diamonds DON'T BUY it. You're asking to be ripped off. Amazon is usually good about providing that information. <end>  I was disappointed.  Nice looking but it was smaller in scale than I expected. It is lightweight. I was surprised that it was made in China. <end>
 B000N9ABWU  Aquamarine and Diamond Fashion Pendant in 10K White Gold ||	  Color wrong  Product promptly delivered in 2 days.Color of stone was not the same as pictured. Should of had a disclaimer in the discription stating color may vary.Sent necklace back and wainting for proof of refund on my card statement. <end>
 B000NBVKAU  Cartouche Pendant - Made in Egypt - with "LOVE" in Hieroglyphics - Open Style ||	  A Beautiful Cartouche Pendent, You'll Love!  This is a beautiful pendent that will definitely be noticed! The open work makes it very unusual, and the silver and gold together are a stunning mix. You can wear gold or silver accessories. My daughter loved mine so much I bought her one just like it. She wore her all through out Europe this Summer. She received compliments daily, and everyone thought she bought it there. This piece means LOVE, and since I recently lost my husband, I love the reminder near my heart. This is the go to piece that really does go with everything. Simply stunning! <end>
 B000NCLF2C  Two Tone Chilly Blue Sapphire Diamond Men's Ring ||	  Husband Loves It  I bought this ring as my husband's wedding band and he really liked it. A lot of our friends were getting married around the same time and after all of the weddings were over I over heard my husband say "Well, I got the best ring out of all the guys." <end>
 B000NDL3NW  Earrings - Tree of Life with Rhodonite ||	  Tree of Life Earrings  These earings were even more beautiful than they appeared on the website. I love them. I gave them as a gift to my best friend and she immediately put them on. Thanks so much. <end>  LOVE THEM!!!!  As stated by others who purchased these earrings, the picture doesn't do them justice. They are beautiful and well worth the cost. I immediately put them on upon receiving them. Will enjoy them for many wears! <end>  Love, love, love!  Thought the earrings looked lovely on the computer screen and was even more thrilled when I saw them in person! These will make a lovely holiday gift for a friend who is deeply spiritual and active in her church. I am checking out this company for more treasures ASAP! <end>  Very Pretty  I bought these earrings for my mother for a Christmas gift. They are really pretty and well made. The Rhodonite is more striated then the picture which that was what I was hoping for. The stone looks more natural with striations through it. The smaller stone looks more purple to me then a garnet, but still very pretty. Wish they had come with backs. I am sure she will love. <end>  Exactly what I expected.  They are perfect - I'm even wearing them now. Was a little surprised they didn't come with plastic backings to avoid loss. Luckily I always have spare. <end>  Beautiful  I ordered these earings and they as as pretty as in the picture. They arrived quickly and I was completely satisfied. I would order from this company again. <end>  Earrings - Tree of Life  These earrings are very pretty, comfortable to wear, I have recieved several compliments on them. <end>  beautiful can't believe the price  I was so surprised to see how beautiful. I expected some rinky dink earring for the price. What a surprise. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. I work in a gift shop that sells earrings and they are double and triple the price and not as beautiful or have meaning. They also came in one day from time of order. I have a ring on order from a famous home shopping network and it takes 10 days at least. I bet the ring will not be as pretty. The ring is made from a famous designer. It will go back and I will order from this company. Buy this earring if you are looking, just beautiful. The pink stone is a lighter pink than shown on the earring, much lighter, but nice. <end>
 B000NE1ZU2  Amazon.com  Stork Pins, Expecting a Girl  Clothing ||	  Perfect!  My grandson was in a hurry to meet his Mommy face to face and was actually born before the baby shower. This was perfect for my daughter to proudly wear at the shower. Very nice piece! <end>  stork oin  I liked this item. i need sixteen more words before i can submit htis. now six, now four, now two <end>
 B000NGBUL4  Ladies single semi-precious drop necklace ||	  Black diamond necklace  The transaction went fine and I received the necklace in good condition, in a timely manner, and my wife was pleased with it. The only thing that surprised me a little was the color was more opaque than I thought. From the picture the stone looks solid black. <end>
 B000NGJ2Y6  Sterling Silver Epoxy Red Dress Charm ||	  Lovely Three Dimensional Sterling Silver Red Dress Charm  I have this charm on my Red Dress bracelet, and it is perfect. The three dimensional design makes it stand out from the rest of my Red Dress charms. Very pretty design. <end>  yasangel  Very lovely charm. I wear it with my Breast Cancer Ribbon Charm and they are really nice together. <end>
 B000NGJ3CM  Sterling Silver Peridot 7-Stone Ring, Size 9 ||	  Great little ring!  The picture Amazon provides for this ring doesn't really do it justice. It appears more stretched out than it really is. The stones are a lot closer together than they appear. They have a great shine to them as well, not as dull as the picture may imply!I really love this ring! I wear it every day. The only thing I want to mention is because of the amount of stones (7), it definitely covers the entire top of my finger and sometimes rubs against the sides of the 2 fingers next to it. It's not often noticeable, though, and I think it's mostly because I have kind of small fingers, so I might notice it more than most people with normal sized hands! <end>  It's OK  All the stones are very loose. I'm certain one of these days I'm going to loose one. A little uncomfortable at first, if there was one lest stone, it wouldn't hit the fingers around it. <end>  Very pretty ring and well made...  ...I bought this for my daughter to stack with a citrine one, blue topaz one, and cz one. The stones are well matched, fairly clear and pretty bright. She is thrilled with it! Very good value especially on sale!!! <end>  Peridot ring  Definitevily need to buy 3 rings and wear them together, could be different stones or all 3 of the same, otherwise looks "bare". I wish the stones were a darker green. Worth it if it is on sale. <end>
 B000NGJ3MC  Sterling Silver Amethyst Bangle Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  A very nice piece....if you get it out of a vending machine.  I had ordered this for my girlfriends birthday, her birthstone being amethyst i thought i was getting a good deal on a nice piece. I was wrong. The stones have very VERY little purple in them, and frankly it just looks very cheaply made. And that is not the worst of it. When i was opening the box i could hear something jangling around, it turned out to be one of the stones that had already fallen out of the bracelet. I WILL be returning this item and i urge you the customer not to waste your time here. <end>  Nice  Bracelet was nice and as described. Clasp is hard to work and stones have very little purple color. However, I think it is a fair value. <end>  Amethyst sterling bracelet  This is made OK. The stones are washed out, no color. Purchased for gifts but will not give them as it will embarrass me. I would have returned them but I was traveling and missed the deadline. <end>
 B000NGJ3UO  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Eternity Ring ||	  looks real..  I really like it, looks real. But I only have had it for 3 weeks. I wear it alot, instead of my wedding rings. I will see if it tarnishes. Hope not. But I did not pay much for it. Hey I recommend it. It is real a good deal for what I payed! <end>  Nice Little ring  This ring is pretty, it can go good with another ring. It narrow and the stone size is small by it self. It would be a good thumb ring. Again nice ring that does not have alot of bling. <end>  Beyond my expectations  perfact fit. Really loved the availabilty on sizes as well. The photos do not do this ring justice! Very Happy Lady <end>  was not what i ordered  it was terrible and not what i ordered at all very very angry when i got my item maybe it was my fault but wasn't happy <end>  great product, simple yet elegant looking!  great product, simple yet elegant looking! very satisfied. on time delivery. Looks and feels as advertised. Had an issue with size, returned and correct size was shipped immediately. <end>  JUST OK  Just OK, not fantastic. Despite the reviews, no, it would NOT fool anyone. It's simply a nice addition to add to a collection of fun jewelery pieces. <end>  Simple and neat genuine looking  So i wanted a simple CZ band which won't scream fake. This does the job- the CZ are recessed properly into the ring and gives that genuine look to it. they stones are not very dazzling or large so for me that was good and believable as diamonds. the ring is not very bright which was a little disappointing because although i didn't want a dazzling ring this is a bit on the dull side akin to when a ring has some age. would work perfectly as a replacement band.***update***So after about 2 months of wearing this band i needed to upgrade my review from 3 stars to 4. The ring actually reflects a little brighter than i first thought so its not dull at all. its a lovely ring! <end>  Very sparkly .. It was a hit!!  The ring was a gift and my daughter loved it!!! It is very sparkly and fit just right! I would highly recommend this product. <end>  Awesome!  This ring is amazing for the price. It doesn't turn my finger green, and the sizing is great. It's just a little bling that isn't too flashy. I wear it as a thumb ring. I think it's really pretty, and very sparkly. <end>  Ring that looks like thousands!!  Very pretty and fits any style--wife enjoys them when just out for the day---I enjoy then on her hand looks great--the fit was perfect--others will enjoy these as well I'm sure!!!Larry <end>  GOREOUS RING, LOOKS LIKE THE REAL THING!!  This ring is crafted beautifully, sparkles like real diamonds and I wear it as a thumb ring. I have gotten many compliments on it and would recommend it to anyone as a wedding band, anniversary band or a right hand ring. It looks great on every finger and fits well with my other jewelry. The price is just right and it is just a described. THANKS SO MUCH for supplying quality jewelry at affordable prices!! <end>  Great purchase  First time I've bought jewerly on line and was pretty anxious about it... but no regrets at all, that was a very nice surprise... ring is beautiful and looks expensive. Go for it! <end>  great ring, looks genuine and perfect size  This sterling ring is not too wide, it has a nice touch with the CZ all the way around, making it easier to wear for my wife, because she doesn't worry about it spinning and cutting into the fingers to the side. The CZ stones are recessed a bit making it pretty smooth. <end>  I use this daily and it's great!  I don't really like wearing my wedding/engagement rings on a daily basis. I'm always doing something with my hands, at the gym etc that the rings make me feel uncomfortable and I needlessly worry about whether the diamonds would drop off or I'd lose them.I bought this ring off Amazon.com as it was a cheap version of what my wedding band looked like. I have used this for the past 1 year and trust me, it's been through a lot. It still looks great! It's comfortable, no maintenance, low stress, negligible investment and it looks great. No one knows it's not my real wedding band!It really does serve my purpose. I would recommend this ring to anyone who would like something affordable for everyday use but doesn't come off like it came out of a 3rd grader's jewelry box. Quality product. <end>  nice ring  This is a nice little ring for the price. I got it to wear on vacation out of the country instead of my expensive wedding rings. It has a decent shine and didn't change color. It was exposed to the ocean, pools, sunscreen, sand and bugspray and still cleaned up and looked new. It is very light weight and I forgot it was even on. It was just what I was looking for. <end>  Very pretty  This is a really pretty ring for a nice price.It shines a lot and seems to be very well made.The only think I don't like on it is that it says MADE IN CHINA in the inside.I would be a little ashamed if I would buy this ring for a gift. <end>  Sterling Silver eternity band  It's a nice sparkly, CZ band nothing extreme the stones are nicely recessed and do not stick out. I bought it as a cheap alternative to keep my gold wedding ring, attached to my engagement ring. <end>  It's a great substitute  My wife is pregnant and couldn't wear her wedding band anymore so I had gotten this as a part of her birthday gift. She definitely loved it and totes it around the office mostly because she can wear a wedding band again, not to mention that the ring is very pretty. I would definitely recommend this product as a financially sound temporary replacement. <end>  Love this ring! Doubles as my everyday wedding band!  I've been looking for an alternative "everyday" wedding ring to wear. I really wanted an eternity band that had stones all the way around, so I wouldn't have to worry about always turning it so that the stones would face outward. Well, it turns out that full eternity bands don't really exist anymore, and if they do, you are going to pay an arm and a leg for it. I have two half-eternity bands at home (real metals/real diamonds), but the "half" eternity part bugged me to no end. So, I saw this ring on Amazon, and it had some good reviews, so I decided to give it a shot.When I first got this ring, I took it out of the box and though "eh..." but I absolutely love it now! It is completely underwhelming when you first take it out, but I put it on, and surprisingly, it matches my engagement ring (platinum, with princess-cut center stone and two solitaire side stones) perfectly!! I've had this ring on 24/7 for over a month now, and now I never taken it off. None of the stones have fallen out or even gotten loose. The silver gets better looking with wear, and it is the perfect complement to my ring. It doesn't outshine my engagement ring, but rather, it nicely enhances it. This is quite possibly the best $14 I've ever spent! <end>  Decent but not just right.  I actually bought two of these rings to flank another ring and they were the perfect size to do with. The only issue I have is that the photo shows more metal than you actually see in person. Otherwise they were exactly what I wanted. Great buy. Great price. Adequate photo representation.(They also have lasted through a lot more wear and tear than any ring should be put through.) <end>  Just as described - maybe better!  I am very happy with this purchase. It is just as described - maybe better. It is a very comfortable ring, has just the right amount of sparkle, looks just like the picture, and saves me having to get my real wedding band sized for now as this one looks almost as good! Thanks! <end>  Solid but not jaw dropping.  I've worn this ring out maybe 10-20 times and have not had any problems with tarnishing or discolorations, even after many handwashings per day. It's quite shiny (both the CZ and the silver), my only knock is that the prongs holding the crystals down have such a large surface area compared to the stones, detracting from the sparkliness of the CZ. (I bought this to replace a channel-set eternity band which did not have that problem.)I was a little concerned that pointy end of the stones would poke my finger through the holes on the inside, but I can't feel them. I don't understand why there are holes at all. <end>  Beautiful rings!  Ordered 2 & they are very well made and can pass as the real thing! So Happy with my purchase! <end>  Fabulous  This little ring is worn regularly and has fared well. No stones have fallen out, it's kept it's sparkle with little cleaning and my mom's friend, who is a jeweler, commented on how well made this ring is when taking a quick look at it. I write this review about a year (or more) after having bought this item, so highly recommend it.The only thing that prevented me buying another one and from giving it 5 stars is that I am very put off by the stamp inside the ring that reads ... Made In China! ... <end>  Good Idea  )  This ring is very cute, sparkles nicely when the light hits it, and is true to size. I would definitely recommend this product to other people and I would also definitely buy it again if I were to go back in time knowing what I know now! <end>  it's great!  My boyfriend gave this to me for valentine's day. I love that I can get leave it on while washing my hands since it's sterling silver so it won't make my fingers green! It also looks pretty legit like something that cost way more! <end>  BEAUTIFUL!!!  This ring is beautiful. Ive never really bought a ring off line so I was a little worried with what I would get. I am a Dental Assistant and I am constantly putting on and taking off gloves, as well as washing my hands. I didn't want to take the chance of messing up my engagement and wedding rings. I wanted a band that I could wear every day at work and not worry about messing it up. I finally decided to get a band after wearing my wedding rings at work for 3 years. The ring sparkles and looks great. I also got the ring a day before it said I would. <end>  2 thumbs up  Purchased 2 of these for my wife to use as a "wrap" for a solitare ring she had. She has been very happy with them and they look great. <end>  CZ ring  This wasn't expensive, but it is rather cheap looking. I have seen better CZ rings like this, at about the same price. <end>  Pretty!  This is a very pretty inexpensive ring that looks like it costs much more than it does. I purchased it as a substitute wedding ring for vacations becuase I always fear leaving my diamonds in the room safe when I go to the pool. This looks ike a real platinun diamond band. Its very tastefull and I couldnt be happier with it. <end>  Worked well.  I bought this ring to wear to work during my pregnancy because my gold ring did not fit anymore. It worked great as a replacement and kept it's shine for months. Definitely worth it. <end>  Stones aren't very standout, but cute ring  Wow, the stones on this ring really ARE tiny. Somehow you really just don't see the separation between the stones on this ring the way you do in the picture. However, for the price, can you really go wrong? It's still a very cute ring. <end>  Getting another one  I initially bought this to keep my engagement ring in place due to weight lose. I needed something comfortable and pretty and that's exactly what I got with this ring! It's dainty and has just enough sparkle. I love it so much that I just bought another one to put on the other side of my engagement ring! I can't believe I found the perfect ring(s) at such a low cost!!! <end>  Perfect - Just What I Wanted  This ring was perfect for what I wanted - size was correct. Although a bit bright when it arrived, with wear it looks more and more like the real thing! Can't beat the price. <end>  beautiful!  For the price this a lovely piece of jewelry. Given as a gift to my daughter she is very pleased with it and looks forward to "stacking" with others. Good solid ring, hopefully will last for a long time! <end>  Perfect  I just received my band and it is exactly what I wanted. I have small fingers and the karat weight is just right, and it has sparkle similar to my real eternity band. I am a nurse and worry about my real diamonds so this is the perfect substitute...no one will know the difference. It would be a great stackable as well, and wish I had ordered a second, which I still may do. Great first jewelry experience with Amazon. What a bargain too! <end>  ring  great item. good quality. like the design of the sterling silver cubic zieconia eternity ring. fits well and easy to clean. <end>  Ring  Love this item. It has stones all around it and I'm planning to give a present to somebody it  ) <end>  it nice, but meh  its nice the first few times you wear it, but it quickly look dingy, even after being careful not to get it too worn out. <end>  better in person  This is great ring! I bought this to wear daily .. my wedding band has well lets say, my fingers have swelled as I have aged. This looks allot more geniune in person. I was not looking for anything that spectacular and something not remotely expensive. I have received allot of compliments and I dont worry about it not being "real" <end>  Very pretty, not durable  I rrceived my ring very quickly in the mail. Because it was on sale, I felt I'd gotten a great deal! Especially once I put it on my finger. Its a beautiful ring! But in less than a week, one of the stones is already gone. What a disappointment. <end>  NICE  THIS IS A NICE ETERNITY RING, UNFORTUNATELY AS I ALWAYS BUY WITHOUT SEE THE SIZE OF THE RINGS, SO THIS IS TOO WIDE AND ALSO THE SIZE IS NOT PERFECTO FOR MY FINGERS BECAUSE IS TOO SMALL FOR THE FINGER WHICH SHOULD GO AND TOO BIG FOR THE HEART FINGER. BUT IF YOU LIKED BUY IT. <end>  Pretty and somewhat good quality  I loved this ring when I first got it. It gives off a great look, but now it seems a bit faded away/washed out. <end>  Ring  Love this fun little ring, bought other stackables and this fit in with them perfect, always fun to wear alone too, got lots of compliments <end>  Loved it  My girlfriend really loved the ring and hasn't taken it off since I gave it to her for her birthday <end>  Pretty  The ring is true to its size. The stones are a bit smaller than expected from seeing the pic but it is very sweet. Goes nicely with my beautiful engagement ring--doesn't take away from the lovely real diamond. It's nice but if your expecting big and fancy keep looking. This is sweet and petite. <end>  it's a 20 dollar ring...  what can you expect? This ring did live up to it's price, I was just hoping to get more than I payed for. Lightweight, no sparkle, cloudy stones...it went back immediately. <end>  Nice ring  Good solid band with just the right amount of sparkle. Using this to replace my wedding set when I'm working as nurse (always afraid of losing a diamond or scratching someone otherwise). <end>  &#9829;  Love it. I ordered this to go with my engagement ring until we save enough for a platinum version. Size is accurate. I adore it. <end>  thumb ring  i love this ring its just what i was looking for i wanted a thumb ring for christmas i got one <end>  Good value  This ring is very pretty and definitely looks more expensive than purchase price. For me the sizing was accurate (8). The stones are small, as pictured, but sparkle. <end>  Surprised  Better than expected. This ring is beautifully made, quite nice for the price. I will buy another one and stack them for this price <end>  ring  I was happy with this ring, it is really sparkly, and I like that. It is thinner then I thought it would be.though. I would recommend it to someone <end>  sterling silver cubic zirconia eternity ring  sterling silver cubic zirconia eternity ring  I liked it a lot , good quality for the price. i'd recommend it. <end>  Not convincing.  I was excited to order this ring. I have developed an allergy to my white gold wedding set and needed something sterling silver to wear. The price is certainly right on this ring, but it isn't really convincing enough to pass as the real deal. I had decided to keep it since it was okay for the price, but I ordered the wrong size and sent it back anyway. <end>  Really nice ring  I bought this to go with my engagement ring. It's really sparkly and nice quality. Looks nice with my real diamond anniversary band <end>  beautiful ring  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Eternity RingI love love this ring. I got married yesterday and as soon as my husband put the ring on. It was gorgeous. Its perfect size. I can stack my engagement ring on top of it. It sparkles just right. Looks expensive ;) I recommend this ring. And the gems don't cut into your fingers. They are set in farther. Its a beautiful ring.  ) <end>  I'LL NEVER TELL  In today's economy, I have no interest in spending thousands of dollars on a piece of jewelry... even if my husband and I are about to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary. So we bought this ring. Quite spectacular. The quality is excellent and the carat weight believable. It looks like a platinum band set with diamonds. And I won't be saying anything different! <end>  So pretty!  Very pretty, dainty ring. Comfortable. I really love the fact that it's sterling silver. I don't know why ring manufacturers use rhodium plated standard silver instead of sterling. It looks much more like 14K white gold and also the weight is more like 14K. The ring is the right size and very thin and light which I love. My real ring scratches my fingers and gets caught in my hair! This is an improvement. <end>  Not so much  I was very disappointed with this ring. I plan on returning it. Looks nothing like the picture. I would have been better off buying something similar at the teen jewelry store at the local mall. Totally over priced not worth it at all. <end>  Really cute  This ring is really cute. The stones are small, but they're set pretty well so they shine nicely. I doubt I'll lose a stone since they're set in so well. Also, the ring is really comfortable to wear. I own different eternity bands and sometimes they're itchy or uncomfortable, but that's not a problem with this one. For a cute, simple eternity band, I would recommend this one. <end>  Beautiful ring and a great alternative to the real thing  I have a gemological certification and have spent a number of years in the high end jewelry industry. I was looking for an eternity band to wear while traveling, afraid to wear my own diamond eternity band abroad. This affordable sterling and cubic zirconia eternity band is far more realistic and beautiful, than I had anticipated. If you're looking for an affordable eternity band, whether it is to replace your own for travel/security reasons, or if you are looking for an eternity band unable to afford real diamonds set in white gold or platinum, for yourself or the one you love, then this ring is perfect.In addition, the ring arrived with a beautiful ring box, as nice as any ring box I've ever seen working in the high end jewlery industry, making it perfect for gift giving. <end>  Serves the purpose  I bought two of the rings to be stack ring on each side of other rings. The height is good. I was disappointed that the CZ is not as noticable as they appear in the picture. But they do look nice with the other rings. <end>  I agree...just recieved today  This ring looks nothing like the picture. the diamonds are small and not very noticeable; I will be sending this back <end>  S/S C/Z Eternity Ring  This ring is slim & fancy at the same time! It is a very precious ring to own & i am proud to say I have one. It was a great deal for the $! I love it! <end>  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Eternity Ring  I was looking for a small silver ring and this one was perfect. It exceeded my expections because the ring was not expensive at all. It is true to size and if you want a ring that sparkles quite a bit this one is it.Mrs. Mayville <end>  sterling cz ring  I truly do love this ring! Everything written about this ring is so true! I would tell everyone this is a spectacular bargain! <end>  Thought it would be a little bigger  But all in all its a beautiful ring. THe stones are inset so the ring is smooth. The ring looks pretty on your finger, very shiny, I hope the person I bought it for will like it as much as I do! <end>  very nice ring  Delicate and very nice for small hands. The stones are sparkly and look real. It stands out but at the same time is very believable <end>  love it  i love this little ring but its too big on me and plus i'm single and wearing the ring just makes me uncomfortable so i had to return. but guys buy this ring for wife/girlfriend cause i can assure you they will love it. <end>  Cheap as h--l!  This rings looks nothing like the picture at all! The stones are so small I can barely even tell they are stones, then the ring is so thin and small. It looks like a ring I would buy in a egg from a machine. I returned it promptly. This was a very misleading buy. <end>  Too small  I returned this item because the diamonds were too small. It wasn't a channel set and you couldn't appreciate the diamonds enough. I found a channel set band of the same size and diamonds were more visible. It was not what I expected. <end>  "Made in China" printed on the inside  Beautiful ring, but with "made in china" printed quite clearly on the inside of the ring, it doesn't seem like the best kind of gift if it's supposed to mean something. Another review warned me of this tacky attribute of the ring, but I thought, "there's no way a 2mm ring could visibly have those words printed on its interior!" Well, I was wrong. <end>  cheesy  When I saw this ring it looked very pretty, wrong! The ring looks very cheesy, nothing like the picture! The stones are so small they are almost non existant. I could have got a nicer ring in a bubble gum machine. I just can't believe I bought this peice of crap. I'll never by another piece of jewelry, unless I see it in my hand first. I live and learn everyday. I won't waste my time sending it back, but at least I learned a lesson! <end>  Eternity ring  I ordered the size I usually wear but it was too small and I did not rec,info.on how to exchange. <end>  Nothing as pretty as the picture  I ordered this ring because it was so pretty and it got great reviews however, I am not happy with it at all but for the price, I will get over it! <end>  dislike  It looked like aluminum foil up against my engagement ring. I am not satisfied as I wanted it to be a temporary wedding band till i get a real one. But I can say by it's self it's cute. It could look real on a finger by itself. <end>  not well made.....  The ring was beautiful when I received it...but one of the stones fell out in the first few days....so I can't wear it any longer.... <end>  I like it.  Stones all the way around. Sparkly. And the right price. Shipped right away, it seemed. All good. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is CZ after all. <end>  gorgeous ring  I got this as a wedding ring replacement due to the the fact my wedding band is too small for me now. This ring is really beautiful and looks so real. What a great price too. <end>  Loved it!  This is a beautiful ring that fits great. I bought this about 6 months ago and i don't have a single complaint about it. I wear it everyday  ) <end>  I love this simple band  I wanted a pretty band with sparkle cause I hate to have a raised up stone with little ones for the scratching. But this ring is perfect. Smooth and shiny. <end>  Just like the Picture.  Fast and Speed delivery! The ring is very SHINY and petite, great for a gift. It looks amazing in the light and goes great with everything.I would definitely recommend this ring for any buyers seeking a simple yet beautiful product. <end>  great ring  This ring is everything it looked on line. It is very pretty and fits nicely under another ring. And you can't beat the price! I've gotten more expensive rings and had the Zirconia fall out within a few weeks but this one seems very well put together. <end>  Disappointed  This was not what I expected, but for the price, I should have realized it would not look like an expensive ring. The stones were very, very small. It was returned. <end>  Great Value  The rings cam long before estimated deliver date and they are exactly what I wanted. They came in a velvt cache and fit perfectly. <end>  Sparkly!  I was looking for a bezel set band in sterling...and this is a very pretty band! Fit is great, looks good on. <end>  Very nice looking Item  The rings are very nice looking and it's easy to wear a couple to get a wider-look effect. I like them a lot! <end>  Pretty and dainty ring  Nicely priced ring for sterling. It sparkles nicely for being small stones, and overall quality is nice and fits great. Fast delivery! <end>  Amazing  I love this ring it goes with all my Jewelry and looks amazing and real thinking about getting all my gfs this ring for Xmas <end>  Decent  After having a lot of trouble finding a wedding band for my small ring finger, I decided on this one. This is the 4th ring I've tried. It fits nicely and looks fine with my small diamond solitaire. Has a good amount of sparkle but definitely doesn't look expensive. Don't let anyone look too closely! <end>  Might not be worth it..  After about a week of wearing it one of the stones fell out. Other then that it was very pretty. But i cant wear it anymore. <end>  Exactly what I wanted!  I needed something simple to wear at work instead of my large diamond. This ring is perfect! The item arrived as stated online and in record speed for being around the holidays and delivery to Alaska. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend to others. And how can you go wrong for that price?! <end>  disappointed!  I wore it once and a stone has already fallen out. Spent way too much money for that to be acceptable. <end>  it's ok  It's ok, not as sparkly as I thought it would be. I'm looking for a substitute wedding ring as my fingers have swelled up since I had a baby. It was a little uncomfortable if you squeeze your fingers together. I ended up returning this one. I think I will purchase a ring in person instead of online. Haven't had much luck so far. <end>  Will buy again!  I love this ring! It is just as beautiful as the picture, actually better! You can't compare the price. I will be buying a few more just to wear stacked on my right hand. <end>  Beautiful Ring  This ring is beautiful, stones are set nicely no gaps and smooth, comfortable fit. Believable and can be stacked with other rings. <end>  Love this ring  I like this ring. Inexpensive, but doesn't look it. Delivery was prompt. I probably should've gotten a slightly smaller size, but that's okay. Fits in with all my other shinies. <end>
 B000NGJ3Y0  Sterling Silver 7-Stone Cubic Zirconia Ring, Size 7 ||	  I purchased this on sale for my daughter...  and I am very pleased. It is well made and very sparkly. I bought the peridot and citrine as well and they stack well all together, with other rings or look great alone. Excellent SS ring for the price! <end>  Gorgeous!  This ring is GORGEOUS! It looks totally real when you look at it. The only way you can tell it's not is if you hold it because it's too light to be real. This could fool anyone. <end>  It's nice enough  It's nice enough, did not realize it would stick out so much. I wanted to where it with my wedding set but found that it looked better alone. I think if I stacked it with some other rings like it, it would be very pretty <end>
 B000NGJ49E  Sterling Silver 3mm Round Cubic Zirconia Tennis Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  Proud to wear this sparkly bracelet.  This is a lovely bracelet and the stones are just the right size and can be mmistaken for a diamond tennis bracelet. It graces your wrist and is delicate looking, not clunky. I love it & wear it alot. I think it looks better "in person". It is NOT worth $90, but $40 is acceptable. <end>  Much nicer than my (missing) tennis bracelet  This bracelet, purchased on a whim and a gold box deal, is more sparkly than my diamond tennis bracelet ever was. The real one always seemed like it needed cleaning in order to be truly sparkly and the settings interfered with sunlight hitting it to get the multicolored effect. This one is also MUCH better than my real tennis bracelet because the real one is missing. This one looked enough like it, from a picture anyway, that I thought my mom wouldn't notice.Anyway, interestingly enough, this bracelet, the zirconia one, has a better locking mechanism than the real one - which is directly related to why it is missing. (A few drinks, a little dancing... and poof, it's gone!) This one is secure and actually a little stiff when trying to get it on and off. There is a double stone system that is also nice because it doesn't catch on things as easily and is strong enough to stay together under a little pressure.And yes, mothers always know. She spotted the fake from 20 feet. In the picture, it looks a lot like a real one. <end>  Very satisfied at the sale price  Within the past week Amazon ran this item at $19.99, including super saver shipping; seconding the other review, you could easily expect to buy this bracelet in a major department store at $40. Not only is this bracelet delicate looking, but it is sturdy, which was a pleasant surprise. It has some weight to it, and the sections are in two-stone pieces, which gives enough flexibility but provides more strength than single stone linkage. The double clasp closing works easily, both on and off. Fortunately, the navy pouch included with the bracelet was not cheesy for gifting. I am happy to be giving this to my granddaughter for her 16th birthday, but I could just as easily keep it for myself. Why didn't I order two when I had the opportunity?July 17 update  note that this item is currently unavailable. About two weeks ago, Amazon did a closeout on these and sold them out for $10 so I did get another one for myself. This is better than having a fairy godmother; thank you, Amazon. <end>  Incredible  Purchased this bracelet during a fantastic promotion. I was quite surprised how impressed I am with this piece. I wear several diamond tennis bracelets together at a time and have added this CZ into the mix. I doubt that anyone other than the savvy on amazon or a jeweler would ever be able to pick out the real vs. cz on my wrist. Stones are large enough to sparkle, small enough to not be gaudy. Clasp is superior to most. Highly recommend ! <end>
 B000NGJ4A8  18k Gold Plated Sterling Silver Sapphire and Diamond-Accent Circle Pendant, 18" ||	  Small  I bought this during an Amazon jewelry sale for under $25. The 18" length is great so it sits nicely when wearing. I give this 3 stars because the pendant itself is very small, similar circumference to a dime. I was anticipating larger. The diamond/sapphire idea is nice, but the stones are so small and squished together that is sort of looks like a wreath. The gold chain is exactly as appears in picture, very average. The stone setting is tight, I'd be amazed if a "chip" ever fell out. It does sparkle a little bit. Not a bad buy for a small pendant that's on super sale. The back is a solid gold circle that says "China" on it. If it wasn't so small, it could be a really great piece of jewelry. <end>  Better than expected  Only paid around six dollars and didn't expect much so was pleasantly surprised to find that it is really very pretty. Looks much more expensive, but I feel free to wear it casually. <end>
 B000NGKKGA  Sterling Silver Enamel Pink Rocking Horse Charm ||	  Any horse lover would love  Ordered this charm for my 7 yr. old granddaughter.More than met expectations. Have since purchased asilver chain for it, and makes a beautiful necklacefor her. <end>  An adorable baby charm  So cute! Exactly what I was looking for to celebrate my daughter's birth. Very good quality. <end>
 B000NGKKMO  Sterling Silver Platinum Plated Simulated Diamond Handbag Charm ||	  Cute but too small...  I actually bought this to give to my mom to put one of her nitro pills in and attach it to a chain. I didn't evedn give it to her I sent it back. It was too small, one pill would have barely fit into it and even at that it would have been hard for her to open. This charm would be perfect on a young girls charm bracelet. <end>  Bracelet Charm  This pocketbook charm was adorable. The picture doesn't do it justice. The person who received it loved it. It really does look very pretty on a charm bracelet. <end>
 B000NGKLDW  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Crown Pendant, 18" ||	  Not impressed  If your looking for sparkle and diamond cut cz's this is not the necklace for you. It has no shine, is very dull. I purchased this for my daughter because of the other reviews but you don't have to. I would never say "Oh, that is so beautiful" Very disappointed plus the chain came all in a great big knot which took me over an hour to undo. Pass on this piece of jewelry. <end>  Shipped poorly  The product arrived in a "velvet" pouch. The chain was in a complete knot and I was unable to untangle. I ended up breaking the chain and purchasing a new one, as there was not time to return before Christmas. I would think twice before purchasing necklaces from Amazon again. Disappointed to say the least. <end>  Feel like a Princess?  So if you feel like a princess this is the necklace to let everyone know it. LOLThis necklace is so beautiful, especially for the price and I would pay twice as much. It is the perfect size and weight, not cheap at all. it almost looks like the stones are real because it is truly well designed.You will be very happy with it if you get one, or it would be the perfect gift. When I received it I made a big deal of showing it off and everyone was very impressed, and the packaging alone with make you feel special.I now know that the Amazon collection is awesome! <end>  Cute  This necklace is very cute, but a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be. I still love it. <end>
 B000NGKLLE  Sterling Silver 7-Stone Cubic Zirconia Ring, Size 8 ||	  I purchased this on sale for my daughter...  and I am very pleased. It is well made and very sparkly. I bought the peridot and citrine as well and they stack well all together, with other rings or look great alone. Excellent SS ring for the price! <end>  Gorgeous!  This ring is GORGEOUS! It looks totally real when you look at it. The only way you can tell it's not is if you hold it because it's too light to be real. This could fool anyone. <end>  It's nice enough  It's nice enough, did not realize it would stick out so much. I wanted to where it with my wedding set but found that it looked better alone. I think if I stacked it with some other rings like it, it would be very pretty <end>
 B000NGMNCE  Sterling Silver Epoxy Sweet 16 Charm ||	  Sweet !  This charm is so adorable. The pink part is a wonderful shade of shiny pink and appears to be baked on so doubt that flaking will occur. The silver sweet 16 is raised ~ the picture does not do the charm justice. Size is perfect for a charm bracelet.Purchased this for a cousin and she was so thrilled with it. <end>  Had to have it for someone turning 16 this year!  I just loved this for my daughter's charm bracelet. She's turning 16 in a few months. <end>  Cindy from Florida  The charm is more lovely than the picture. A precious color of pink. In addition the charm arrives in a small navy velvet bag which is placed in a navy box. So is a very elegant presentation.Lastly, it arrived just 2 days after purchase selecting the free shipping option. <end>
 B000NGMNT2  Sterling Silver Amethyst 7-Stone Ring, Size 5 ||	  Not comfortable to wear  First, the color of the stones is lighter than is pictured. I realize it is hard to capture color in a picture, but the ring I received has stones that are light purple to almost a pink color. For the price of the ring I can deal with that though, I mean, what can you expect for $29? The worst part is that it's just hard to wear because it's not comfortable. It would have been better with five stones instead of seven because the two outer stones rub against your other fingers and it gets annoying fast. I'll be returning this ring and will try something else. <end>  Nice ring, very pale color  The color of the stones is a lot lighter than in the picture. However, it is still a very nice ring, so I am going to keep it anyway. At 40% off, it was inexpensive enough, and it goes with the equally pale stones in the matching earrings... <end>  sterling silver amethyst ring  arrived earlier than stated date, stones a little lighter in color than i like best, but it is a nice addition to my amethyst collection. i will definately purchase from this seller again. <end>  7 stone ring  it is very nice the only problem with it is that the stones hurt my fingers. they are too separated. <end>  not happy with  When I received this ring, I put it aside because I was very ill at the timewhen I did look at it, it was past the time to return it. In the picture it looksround, but when i received it, it is more square than round. it justlooks odd and now I have a ring that is ugly and no one wants it. <end>
 B000NGMO8W  Sterling Silver Hoop Earrings (0.7" Diameter) ||	  ok  they are ok look a lot bigger in the pic but all in all good for the cash i put out for the earrings <end>  Not As They Appear  What a disappointment. The stones are really pink and the clasp often comes undone. Also, note the size...they are tiny. <end>  Beautiful...but problems.  The earrings were very beautiful as they came out of the box. One was perfect, the other, all the garnets were losse in their settings and two even fell out. Not very happy with them. <end>  Beautiful  These Garnet Earrings are beautiful! They are well worth the price. No problems at all. Purchased as a gift for my aunt, and she loved them too. Highly recommended to anyone thinking of purchasing. <end>  Garnet Hoop Earrings  Although very pretty, the garnet stones are more orange thanred. I am keeping them, but would have preferred a more redstone color. I would have rated these 5 stars but for thecolor. <end>  Loose Stones  As you can see by many reviewers, the stones tend to fall out of these. Very disappointing! Amazon should not allow these to be sold anymore. Do not be tempted to buy as they are crap. <end>  Love these!  I bought these several years ago from Amazon and have worn them lots of times. They are noticeable without being overly large. I lost one yesterday, getting ready to order another pair! <end>  garnet earrings  These are beautiful garnet earrings...birth stone for January. I love the way they fasten and don't pinch your ears or have to worry about losing them. Not real large but show up very well. <end>  stone fell out  These are pretty earrings but the first time I went to put them on, one of the stones fell out and I had to return them. They are cheaply made and I do not recommend them. <end>  VERY small  I suppose I didn't read the description correctly, but I did think these were bigger than they were. I bought them as a gift for my grown daughter since her birthday is in Jan. and they're a garnet stone, but they'd probably be better as a gift for a small child. After reading the other reviews I just hope the stones - infitisimal as they are, don't fall out. <end>  GREAT VALUE & BEAUTIFUL  Very elegant! Great value and quality. The stones are a beautiful vibrant green color. Very pleased. <end>  not what expected  i got these earrings for myself after i gotSterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Hoop Earringsfor my sister. i should have taken a closer look at the picture (so it is my own fault i'm dissatisfied with the product), my sister's earrings were so pretty, but i do not like the way the stones are set on these ones. i kept them, but i don't wear them often as i do not think they're very pretty. <end>  beautiful and secure  I live these hoops, look great and have a locking clasp so I never have to worry about losing one. <end>  Garnet Hoop Earrings  I bought these earrings for my daughter and she just loves them. They are petite and the proportions are just right. I think the price was very good for the quality. <end>  Earrings  I was surprised at how well made the earrings are and look very pretty when worn. I am vfery pleased with this product <end>  You get what you pay for!  I bought these earrings, and the first time I took them off, a stone fell out. I glued it back in, the second time I wore them it fell out again. Lost it, so these go in the trash! Don't waste your money. <end>  stones fell out  I purchased these as a gift for my aunt off of her wish list. During a recent visit to her house she informed me that a stone had fallen out of one of her earrings. She had it fixed (at a large expense) then only to have more stones fall out of both pair. <end>  Disappointed  I was really disappointed... I bought these as a Christmas present for myself..haha I received these yesterday just in time to wear them to my office Christmas dinner/party. Got them out of the box, left one went on fine, but while putting in the right one, one of the stones fell out. Of course, as small as the stones are, took me forever to find it. Needless to say, I had to put my other earrings back on and put these back in the box  ( As far as looks, I thought they were very beautiful, unfortunately I won't be able to wear them, first without fixing the one, and second without the fear that the other stones will ultimately fall out and be lost...oh well. <end>  stone fell out  These earrings were pretty, however, one of the stones fell out the first time I wore them. I sent them back two weeks ago and am still waiting for a confirmation that the shipment has been received and a refund. <end>  Smaller than they appear.  These earrings are smaller than they appear, the stones are very pale making them hard to see. <end>  Gorgeous glint of green!  I adore these earrings! The peridot stones are a beautiful shade of green, and very sparkly for the size. These are very well crafted and oh so comfortable to wear. The sale price I got them for was a steal, and since they are so versatile I know that these are going to be wonderful go-to earrings for a very, very, very long time. <end>  Beautiful, simple, just what I wanted  I adore these earrings. I haven't taken them off since my husband gave them to me three days ago. They are light, comfortable, fasten securely, and are just the right size for everyday wear.As a previous review mentioned, the stones are pale, but they are peridots, not emeralds, so the should be a light color; still, they are definately green.They are just beautiful earrings and for the price I ended up paying when they were on sale (about $6) they were an incredible deal. <end>  Stones fall out  I received these as a Christmas gift. One of the stones fell out. Don't waste your money on these, instead buy earrings of better quality. <end>  Cute, casual everyday earrings  I bought these to wear to work. The peridot stones are small, but not too small to see, just small enough that it doesn't look like you're wearing bright green earrings, making them versatile enough to wear with just about everything. I wear them 4-5 days a week and get compliments on them; they're a nice deviation from standard post diamonds or pearls, but small enough to look professional. <end>  Wife was upset  I purchased these as a gift for my wife. She loved them, they are very pretty and dainty. However, after 3-4 uses, several of the stones popped out and we were unable to fix it. It was too late to return them, so we just threw them out. Due to the design, the earring bends a little each time you put them on or off. It's really a shame, because they are quite nice, but, it's only a matter of time before the stone(s) will pop out. <end>  faulty clasp  The earings were nice enough when they arrived, however upon wearing them a couple of times I noticed that the earing did not 'catch' well on one of them. It opened several times when I was out. I was always checking them to make sure they were there. Last week while out on an errand, I came home and noticed that one of them was gone. It had opened up and fallen off while i was out. They need to make sure the clasps work better. <end>  Fantastic deal!  These earrings are a great addition to peridot jewelry. I found similar earrings in white gold for over $300, and I am very happy with these look-alikes. They hang nicely and match my white gold pieces well. <end>  Loose connections  The earrings are beautiful, but the clasp does not stay closed very well on its own on one of the earrings. Took it to a store and they tightened it right up. <end>  SO cute!  I bought these as a mothers day gift, and she LOVED them. they are nice and small. The green is in the pic is accurate to the actual stone. these earrings are subtle and oh so cute and sparkly!! just wish they came in RED! <end>  Sterling Silver Garnet Hoop Earrings Make Me Happy!  I wasn't sure "how these would work" before purchasing but the mechanism for "opening, inserting into the ear and closing" is smooth with no "jerks, stops or starts." The earrings just slip in in a few seconds. They are beautiful, the right size for me (I have small ear lobes) and I am really enjoying having them in my jewel box. I wear them often, I would say at least 3-4 times a week. <end>  beautiful earrings  I'm very happy with the quality and look of these earrings. I really like the way the backs are hinged so the post does not poke into your head behind your ears when you're sleeping. The garnets are lighter in color than pictured, almost pinkish, but still very beautiful. <end>  Deep Red Color???  The earrings are pretty. However, as an owner of numerous garnets of varying shades, I cannot stress enough that these will not be able to be worn with ANYTHING red. They are a very pale orange color. Maybe I got duds, but the description is completely inaccurate. They're a clear orange color. No red undertones or anything. I'm keeping them because they were $20 and it's not worth the hassle of returning them. I'm doubting whether they're actually garnets, but at this point I guess I just don't care. <end>  Nice -- but odd color  These were pretty, sparkly and packaged nicely, but they were far from the color that is shown. They are more of a pale orangey color. They are still nice for the price, but not what is shown. <end>  Nice for cheap earrings  These were exactly what I expected for the $20 I paid. The garnets aren't the darkest I've ever seen, but they are pretty and the earrings sparkle. <end>  Garnets are pink  These would've been a good bargain, but I am not happy with the garnets. The stones are very light in color...almost a pinky orange. I bought them for a gift, so will probably still give them, but am a little disappointed <end>  Beautiful  I absolutely love these earrings, I bought these for my 3 year old daughter last christmas, and they look beautful, they never have tarnished or fallen out...She is always complimented on them, needless to say she is very much into jewelery....I great buy. She is still wearing them and never takes them out. <end>  Poor Quality  I got these as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. I thought they'd make a good stocking stuffer since peridot is her birthstone. However, when I recieved the pair I ordered, I immediately opened them up to make sure they were what I had ordered. One of the earrings had a missing peridot stone. I returned them as per Amazon.com's return policy (which I must say, is extremely easy to use, painless, and hassle-free). I recieved a replacement pair within a short period of time (still before Christmas) and checked them to see if they had all of the stones intact. Unfortunatly, the replacement pair also had a earring that was missing a peridot stone (in a different position than the last pair). After I sent the second pair back, Amazon.com refunded my money and apologized for the problem. Good service from the company, too bad the product had flaws. <end>  A lot more sparkly than I thought they'd be...  I got these for 30 percent off on one of those one-day Amazon special sale events. I love garnets; I just wanted to see what a pair of garnet-embellished hoops would be like at such a discounted price.I was surprised. The hoops were a lot bigger than I thought they'd be (just shy of 3/4 of an inch.) The garnets themselves aren't the deep, rich red with a touch of brown I associate with garnets. The color is a slightly watered-down version.But because there are so many garnets, each faceted, on the hoops, they are suprisingly sparkly. I have long, dark hair, and it's kind of hard to see any kind of earring through my hair, but not these earrings. It surprised me a few times to pass a mirror and see the glint of garnets under my heavy hair! A very pleasant surprise!The back of the hoop snaps pretty firmly into the slot (do take the time to make sure the post is firmly seated when you put the earring on. I didn't do that once and brushed my hair, and the earring went flying with very little provocation! It'd be a shame to lose such a pretty earring by not taking the extra second or two to make sure the earrings are on firmly.)They're very pretty earrings, a nice gift for the garnet lover, and an especially nice present for someone who likes earrings that SHOW but aren't overly big or flashy.Try to latch onto them when they go on sale again. For the approx. $20 I paid, yes, they were very worth the money. <end>  Nice for the price  The reviewer who found these small must be a GIANT. These are very nice for the price, very attractive. The stones are a bit lighter than shown, bu they are clearly green. They are elegant small hoops. Latches are snug and wires are sturdy but not too thick. <end>  Great Earrings!  I love these earrings. There were a great price and I get so many compliments on them! People always think I paid a lot for them. I actually haven't taken them off since I bought them because they go with everything and are so comfortable...even to sleep in. I totally recommend these beautiful hoops. <end>  Pretty and affordable!  I read the reviews on these before I bought them, and was expecting tiny based on how a few reviewers said they were smaller than expected. These are not tiny. These are a great size for a hoop earring, (and for me, a perfect size!). My stones have all stayed in the setting, and their color is the deep red with slight orange flares that I associate with a decent garnet. Maybe mine were just a good pair, but I have no complaints about these. They are well worth the price in looks, craftsmanship and wearability. <end>  Pale - Pale - Pale!  Emeralds are a deep luscious green! Gorgeous but expensive.Peridot is much, much paler, and much much more affordable.But these were SOOOO pale they were practically yellow - and a pale yellow to boot.And they are indeed smallish.I would not buy them again and I donated them to a thrift shop to sell so they could raise some money for a good cause.I think the photo is way too flattering. Kind of dishonest, really. <end>  very cute  these are noticeable green, they are smaller than I imagined, but they are not to small, they do not feel heavy on my ears and trading them for a stud feels no different in weight. the clasp seems strong so they wont fall out. <end>  OK  The earrings aren't so charming because of very pale stones. In reality they are nice but no more than that. <end>  Nice Hoops  These Silver PeridotHoop Earings pleased my wife a lot they have a good substantial "feel" to them, she loves the classic secure clasp lock and they complemented the Periodot Celtic Silver Necklace purchased thru Amazon from Silver Insanity last year.Happy Amazon Shopper <end>  Garnet Earrings  They are very comfortable to wear and I like the closing that way I don't lose them unlike others where the backing sometimes falls off. <end>
 B000NGMOT6  Sterling Silver Pave Simulated Diamond Ring ||	  Beautiful ring  I love this ring. The "diamonds" are small enough that it looks real. I wear it constantly, and it still looks great. <end>  Great ring..  It's beautiful. It's clean and It looks great. I would of course rather buy http //amzn.to/fsGM7V but considering the cost this is not bad at all  ) <end>  disappointed  I was disappointed in the aring.. I thought it was going to show the crystal stones better. I would not get another one nor would I tell anyone to purchase this ring <end>  The Perfect Replacement  Due to some issues with my wedding band I picked this up as a temporary replacement. I looked around the internet and did my homework and found this ring to be perfect for me. Simple enough to not be obviously CZ. I have to say I adore it! I find it very comfortable to wear, it just feels like a textured band on the hand, nothing jagged at all. The stones are small enough to look real and the metal has a nice color to it, not cheap looking like most silver/cz rings you see at department stores. The only disappointment I had upon receiving it was that the stones weren't as pronounced as the photo. The do seem to be a bit hidden by the metal. Even with that though I'm extremely happy with it and I've had many ooh and ahhs of friends and family. Absolutely worth every penny! <end>  Beautiful and real shine...  I was looking for something to use as a wedding band. Nothing expensive as I don't need real diamonds, they aren't that important to me. This is perfect. The picture I have doesn't do it justice. The shine is beautiful and the diamonds do look real. It's not huge and unrealistic looking. There is no way, in my opinion that anyone would know if it was real. I read some of the other feedback about this ring scratching the other fingers, I wear it with my other wedding ring and I don't have that problem. It doesn't scratch my fingers at all. I do have to say that it does scratch if you rub your face though, you may want to take the ring off in the shower or when washing your face. Other than that, I love it, it's beautiful. <end>  Product and its packing!!!  I just wanted to let everyone to know that I received the ring faster than I expected and it couldnt have been packed any better. My wife also loved it so I couldnt be happier. I would suggest anyone thinking about doing business with this seller to do so, because of my wife being happy Im happy. Thank you again and I look foward to doing business with again. <end>  Not bad at all  I really like the look of this ring. It goes well with everything. My only complaint is that it's not the most comfortable ring to wear. Overall though, it's not a bad buy for the money. <end>  Pretty but it kinda hurts  This ring is exactly like the picture and it's a good deal for the price. Sometimes the sides of the ring will scratch my other fingers and if you're holding someone else's hand, it will pinch. <end>  cubic ring  Looks nice, but very uncomfortable wearing. Worth it the inexpensive price if you are wearing it for short periods of time. <end>  GORGEOUS !!!!!!!  I wish I could give 10 stars. I LOVE this ring. Exactly what the picture shows. Also packaged very cute, like it came from a very expensive store. LOVE!!!! <end>  Growing on me.  I got two to wear on either side of my 5mm yellow gold wedding band with a 1.3 karat round stone mounted on it. Just wanted a different look than my channel set diamond bands that I have worn on either side for years. At first, I thought the pave bands were too much, and took away from the solitare. I decided to wear them over the weekend with my wedding ring, and now I like them. I have received compliments as well. At first, they felt bulky compared to my other anniversary bands, but now I am used to them and they are comfortable. I am happy with the purchase. A totally different look at a very affordable price. They look much more expensive than they are. <end>  Beautiful  I was looking for something that I could wear everyday as a substitute for my wedding set when I saw this. I had my doubts based on some of the reviews I read saying that it wasnt comfortable or what was expected.I was not disappointed with this buy. It was far more than I expected and was more than worth the price. Its comfortable and very sparkly but at the same time neat and not overwhelming for me as I prefer smaller and finer jewelry.highly recommended. <end>  Ring  Wish this ring would come in 1/2 sizes really needed a 6 1/2 very well made was happy with this purchase <end>  Very well made  Due to the variance in the other two reviews, I was hesitant to purchase this ring. However, when Amazon lowered the price to $11.60 on a special one-day sale, I went for it. This ring is true to size and is marked on the inside with a jeweler's mark, and the words CZ 925 China. I looked it over carefully with a jeweler's loup; it is very well made, indeed having 96 inset small stones in a pave setting, which is accurately reflected by the product picture. The ring is smooth to the touch, having no rough spots; I mention this because I purchased a similar ring from Nordstrom's online, and it had ragged edges and nowhere near the shine that this one has. The ring is also very pretty, lightweight, and if you like sterling silver, you will like this ring. <end>  Love it!  Just got this ring, and I absolutely love it! We had an accident with my wedding band and the garbage disposal (wedding band lost), so this is my 'replacement' band until I get a new one made later this year. Wanted something in sterling silver so the color wouldn't turn, and LOVE the look of pave diamonds.It really sparkles, and would definitely make a great wedding band (who CARES if it's not real diamonds!) <end>  This ring is gorgeous!  Wow, this ring sparkles more than I expected! It truly is beautiful and for me I don't mind wearing cubic zirconia so this is perfect. Really a great piece of jewelry for a really good price. <end>  Pretty Little Ring  This is a very pretty little ring. It's understated, yet bright and sparkles in all different lighting. I'm tired of my old rings and since they always spin around anyhow, I thought a nice stacking ring might add some thickness to help against the spinning. It works to some degree and also gives my old rings new life! It's really great because even if this ring does spin around, all you'll ever see is sparkle. <end>  Just right!  This lovely ring is just what I wanted to compliment a pave style halo engagement ring I have. It is not too wide and not too narrow, and it shines and matches the pave stones on my engagement ring. It's a lovely ring for either a wedding ring, eternity ring or just to add some sparkle to your finger. It is comfortable and looks great. I love it! <end>  Gorgeous!  Love this ring! Absolutely gorgeous! Every time I wear t, people are constantly complimenting me on it. Well made also! <end>  Pave silver ring  I received the ring on the day it was promised. And I love this ring. The stones are very shiny and so is the silver. Very sparkling. I've been wearing it daily and it hasn't lost it's shine like some rings do. Its texture is a little rough if you rub your face but nothing that scratches. Overall this is a great gift for yourself or someone else with a great price tag! <end>  Not so great  I thought the picture looked good, but I didn't like the ring very much once I saw it in person. It's also not very comfortable to wear. <end>  pretty but a little rough  small but sparkly stones but is definitely rough and a little hard to wear all day. makes a nice party or evening ring. <end>  Perfect interim wedding band  I ordered this after a diamond fell out of my shared-prong eternity wedding band to wear while it was being fixed. I still haven't made it to the jewelry store yet to have the diamond reset. This ring is beautiful--I highly recommend! <end>
 B000NGOGFG  Sterling Silver Enamel Ladybug Charm ||	  Mistake  Just got my order today and was disappointed. They shipped the box with a bag in it but no charm. How do you mess that order up? How do you stick a bag in a box without the charm inside?? <end>  Nice Charm But Falls Slightly Short  The charm itself is perfect. The luster on the laquered shell is nice and the color really stands out against a silver charm bracelet. I felt the clasping method, however, was poorly thought out. For any charm bracelet that is robust enough to wear on a daily basis, the split ring style clasp will distort and not return to its original shap after it has been placed on the bracelet. My wife kept getting it caught on her clothes (sweaters were constantly snagging). I had to remove the split ring and replace it with a purchased locking c-jewelry clasp. I am not a fan of having to upgrade jewelry after a purchase, thuse the low star rating. The <end>  Perfect! Just what I wanted!  This was just the right size and shape for my charm bracelet. My grand-daughter loves lady bugs and this reminds me of her everytime I wear it. It is perfect - on time and just what we wanted. <end>  Ladybug Charm  It is quite lovely. The way it was in a velvet pouch inside the box was a nice touch too. Very good quality. I would purchase from this seller again. <end>  Happy with the charm  The charm is very nice quality. It came with a little velvet pouch which made it a good and special gift. <end>  Nice size  Charm is a nice size. The slider to put on bracelet is slightly better than another recent charm I purchased but will have concerns of it falling off if not careful when it is worn on a bracelet. <end>  ok  I love ladybugs, and I bought this for my pandora bracelet and it didn't fit, I had to force the ring open with some tweezers to get it in, also the ring it comes with is not as good looking or flattering as all the other charms. The back of the ladybug is hollowed and it has the word CHINA written on it. thankfully it's not that easy to see in plain sight. Otherwise, the quality is good so far, I've had it on for three days now and everything is ok. <end>  Just perfect  I just love this little lady bug charm -the size and workmanship are just perfect. This size fits my charm bracelet so well and just looks great with the other charms. <end>  Too expensive for its size  Item looks exactly as pictured.To my opinion it is too expensive for its size though. <end>  Not for Pandora  I love this little charm...It's very cute, and does look pricy. The only problem I have is that I'll have to make alterations for it to fit my pandora bracelet. The hoop the lady bug swings from is too small to fit on my bracelet. <end>  lady bug charm  I purchased this lady bug charm to celebrate the birth of my little granddaughter, Ava. It is delicate and 'charming' just as Ava is! <end>
 B000NGOH64  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Pear-Shaped Pendant, 18" ||	  very nice looking pendant, but color is quite light  This pendant looks well made, it is a good size, the pear shaped is attractive , and the gems are all set nicely. The only drawback to me is the color of the gems in real daylight are not very blue at all, and they definiely look lighter than the photo in the ad. In some lights you can hardly tell that it's blue at all. If i had known this, possibly i might not have purchased this particular pendant. But since i have it now, i will keep it, since other than the pale color, I am generally satisfied with this purchase and the sale price seemed about the right price. <end>  Blue Topaz Pendant  Love it! Initially ordered one pendant as a Christmas gift then immediately ordered two more after first purchase arrived in the mail. Delicate yet substantial and will certainly be noticed. The stones are a light sky blue, but the color is as depicted in the picture. Exaggerated prong detail between each stone provides a nice solid structure to the piece. Very pleased and would highly recommend purchase as a gift or to treat yourself. <end>  Beautiful!  A very beautiful pendant. The gems are actually a little bit lighter than pictures, but are a very pretty subtle blue. Great for casual or dressy attire! <end>
 B000NGOHB4  Sterling Silver Peridot Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  Birthday gift  I received this as a birthday gift, and I love it.It is a beautiful bracelet, well-constructed.Classy.It is the perfect gift for an August birthday.I definitely recommend that you buy this bracelet. <end>  Sterling Silver Peridot Bracelet  I was very happy with this piece of jewelry. Its lovely and the stones sparkle beautifully. It made a lovely Christmas gift. <end>  August Birthstone Bracelet  A holiday gift for my daughter which is her daughters birthstone. It's stunning and I'm sure a winner! <end>  Poor Quality!  This bracelet is poor quality of gemstones and poor craftsmanship. Gemstones are very cloudy and some of the joints in the chain or fused together and the bracelet therefore can't be straightened out completely. In other words, if you unfasten the bracelet and lay it out on the counter it will not form a straight line because some of the joints in the bracelet are fused together and do not bend so you cannot straighten the bracelet. Don't buy this, it's junk. <end>  Pretty but not what I expected  This is a very pretty bracelet, but the stones are much lighter in color than I expected. The stones had hardly any color to them. <end>  NICE SURPRISE  I wasn't sure how this would be, but I was presently surprised. Stones are a nice green color. Very nice for the price! <end>  Very good value  For the price, this is a VERY nice piece of jewelry. We gave this to my mother for Christmas because she wanted something with the grandbaby's birthstone. This is very pretty and has a timeless elegance to it. <end>  bracelet  gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous!The stones were a light green and a little cloudy but they still sparkle really brightly. The construction of the silver is solid. <end>
 B000NGOHGE  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia 3-Stone Pendant, 18" ||	  Valentine gift  This was much nicer than I thought it would be. Very pretty, and classy. Given and recieved with great appreciation. She is thrilled, and doesn't know the (low) price. <end>
 B000NGOHVY  Sterling Silver Oval Cubic Zirconia Cocktail Ring, Size 8 ||	  Cocktail Ring  I was expecting a less than perfect ring for the price. To my amazement and joy.......it is FABULOUS! And HUGE! I am VERY pleased! <end>  Outrageous, but fun  This is faux jewelry at its finest. While no one is ever going to believe this is the "real thing," the workmanship is excellent. That is, the setting of the small cubics around the big stone (which is fabulously brilliant) is meticulously, and impeccably done. The small stones have great shine as well. The ring is marked 925 and China.The only thing that I should have paid more attention to are the dimensions because of my small, somewhat chubby, fingers. The dimensions, translated from metric, are  the length is a little over 1 inch, and the width is about 5/8 inch. If you have long, graceful, fingers, this would be perfect. On my finger, the ring reaches my first knuckle, but I love it anyway even though it is really too big for my hand. Within the past three weeks Amazon ran this ring for $8.75 (really did), including super saver shipping. <end>  Fantastic!  I love this ring. It is really large, but it looks much better in person than on the picture. It's high quality too. <end>  Perfect  I purchased this ring for my grandaughter who loves a lot of glitter and bling. This ring is perfect. It seems to be a good quality, is detailed, and looks like I paid more for it then I did. I know my grandaughter will love it.If you are looking for a large stone ring, this is it. I was looking for a large stone, and I was looking for something different with in a budget. She will be able to wear this ring for a long time, as it is made well, amd sterling silver.Also, it can be sized, since it is sterling silver.I am a happey shopper. <end>

 B000NGOHXW  18k Gold Plated Sterling Silver Sapphire and Diamond-Accent Cross Pendant, 18" ||	  Wonderful color, and size!

The saphires are very dark, very nice. <end>
 B000NHLPUY  18k Gold & Stainless Steel Men's Tie Clip w/ Cupid Emblem ||	  Stainless Steel Tie Clip  Had been searching for a modern tie clip with a chain (to avoid loosing it). The Silverspeck tie clip is really nice quality and modern looking with a gold Cupid emblem on a stainless steel clip. It was delivered very quickly and in a nice packaging. <end>
 B000NHS2JQ  Debonaire Mens Surgical Steel Matte Finish Bracelet with Carbon Fiber Highlights ||	  extremely pleased  The bracelet was nicer than I had anticipated. It came in a nice box which made it even more special. Would do business with this place again. <end>
 B000NHTFLA  Elegant Spring Locking Mens Stainless Steel & Carbon Fiber Cuff Bracelet ||	  Nice looking but not good quality.  The product is nice looking and light weight but unfortunately that also means cheap. Within two weeks one of the screws got caught on my jeans and the entire bracelet was in pieces. It's too bad because I really liked it otherwise. <end>  a swing and a miss...  Nice style, poor execution. Not enough strength in the springs to actually keep it closed as illustrated. Yours might be different. I'm shopping industrial suppliers for better springs, but meanwhile, this sits in a drawer. <end>
 B000NHU38O  Cruise Ship Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Great gift  Sometimes you take a risk with a product that you don't get to see beforehand and all you have to go on is the picture. But I was quite pleased by the quality of these cufflinks when I received them. They are solid and heavy and well-made. For a novelty congratulations gift, this turned out to be quite a winner. <end>
 B000NHV6AI  Snowflake Bracelet ||	  Great Product at a Great Price!  I purchased this bracelet for 6 of my dearest friends, it arrived way before it was forecasted, packaged beautifully and looked like a million bucks! I recommend this seller to anyone who wants to get some glam! Excellent product, look forward to next Christmas to buy from again! <end>  great gift  I got this for my sister in law as a small token of my sentiment. She loves it and all have asked where she got it. <end>  Cutest Bracelet Ever  When I opened my package and saw this bracelet, I knew instantly that I had made the right decision to purchase it. I'm giving them as gifts to attendants for my winter wedding, and I couldn't be more satisfied. The picture really doesn't do it justice! <end>
 B000NHV6NK  Quoted Jewels Counting Birthdays Bracelet - March ||	  Gift Bracelet  Was a gift for my step-mother for her 71st birthday - she loved it, and it was beautiful; the quality was very good and it looks more expensive than it was. <end>  I don't get it.  I keep coming back to this bracelet to find a better description of what it is supposed to represent. Quoted Counting Birthdays Bracelet? What does that mean? What does it count? What did the designer mean? Does one select stones? Does one exchange stones as time goes on? Does one add to it as time goes on.I have been attracted to this bracelet for some reason, for well over a month at least, yet I can't figure out what I am seeing and what I would be buying if I got it. It may have been just the right gift for my niece this past November...may have been. May be perfect for anyone. If the whole idea was clear...I've kept it on my wish list...WISH I could learn if it should be on my shopping list.m.wall, smile <end>
 B000NHXV0G  Yellow Tiger Swallowtail Butterfly Sterling Silver and Enamel Earrings by Zarah ||	  Delightful  I ordered this pair of earrings to match a scrub uniform that I wear to work. What a delightful surprise when they arrived. The earrings matched perfect. The colors are vibrant and I get compliments every time I wear the earrings. <end>  A real beauty  This is a very beautiful earring. It is also so lightweight, one doesn't feel it on. I was very pleased with it, and when my daughter saw it, she wanted a pair, too--which we have already ordered and received. <end>  They look like real butterflies.  These earrings are well detailed and are beautiful. They look very life like, and are fun to wear. Would order them again. Hope to see the "blue" butterflies back in stock. Would like to order those as well. They are fun and I gave them a 5 star. <end>  Pretty earrings. Very dainty.  Pretty enamel earrings, bought as a gift.For $22, they should have come with the little stoppers on the hooks so they don't fall out of your ears. Most earrings have those now. Also, 3-5 day shipping was delivered in 8 days, but other than that, the earrings are very pretty. <end>
 B000NHY1TQ  Garden Tool Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Fabulous Garden Cufflinks  Not only was the product adorable, but the company was extremely pleasant to deal with. I had to change my delivery address three times and they accommodated me each time, with a quick response. <end>
 B000NHYTYI  Genuine 18K Gold rubber Stainless Steel Screws Diamond Cable Mens Bracelet ||	  Disappointed  Not as sturdy as I thought. Picture looks good on web but in reality, rather flimsy. <end>
 B000NHYWW2  Hummingbird and Lily Sterling Silver and Enamel Pin by Zarah ||	  hummingbird  It was a gift for x-mas for my freind and she loved it. She wears a brooch everyday to work . <end>
 B000NI7L2O  14k White Gold Diamond Heart Stud Earrings (1/10 ct. t.w.) ||	  Cute  These are cute little earrings, good for the price. They are about 1/3" wide, and have a surprising amount of sparkle considering the diamonds are so small. <end>
 B000NID29A  Three Strand Multi Color Stone Bead Strech Bracelet ||	  re-occuring theme  they were cute enough when I got them. great for casual wear with jeans. they broke in a little over a week. seems to be the re-occuring theme with anything from silverspeck. I have begun avoiding any jewelry they sell on here. <end>
 B000NIKQJ4  KKPS021 Gorgeous Multi Gemstone Sterling Silver Pendant Charm ||	  Simple, clean design and quality gemstones  Ordering and receiving this pendant was a joy!

 B000NILTCM  Dainty Blue Czech Crystal Butterfly Cell Phone Dangle Charm ||	  Cute  Its a cute charm, but about a week after I had it, the middle jewel fell out and I had to super glue it back in. Its fine now. <end>
 B000NIMEG2  Sterling Silver Round Blue Sapphire Gemstone Wavy Shaped Rhodium Plated 1.5 inch Long Pendant charm ||	  Beautiful pendant  Beautiful pendant. Much nicer in person, it sparkles with the sapphires. Excellent service, fast delivery. Would buy again. <end>
 B000NJ3XF2  Genuine Amethyst Quartz 8mm Bead Stretch Bracelet Set ||	  A beautiful set -- very pleased  I gambled and ordered a bunch of items from Silverspeck. Fortunately, out of some 30 items, 27 are very high quality (the other 3 I'll just accept as fun items, because out of them none was more expensive than ca. five dollars).This bracelet set is one of the affordable yet high quality items. This isn't some cheap plastic! The stones look and feel natural, and the picture is trustworthy. Also, this particular set is fine for broader wrists as well. <end>  Nice bracelets for a gift  My friend loved this bracelet set - very inexpensive, but a nice gift and pretty beads. <end>  Great Bracelets  The bracelets were exactly how they were described. They arrived when expected. I have worn them several times and they look great. I would buy from this company again. <end>
 B000NJDQUO  Sterling Silver Cross Cut-out Pendant, 2 inch tall ||	  Deceptive Description  This item is described as being " 2" Tall ". It is actually a tad under 1.5". I e-mailed Sabrina Silver about my dissatisfaction with the deceptive description of the cross. They wrote me back that they didn't like my "tone" and that they were not going to apologize. They have however changed the description. Be advised though that the newly described height includes the loop on top of the cross. <end>
 B000NJEW5C  Sterling Silver Four Leaf Clover Locket, 18" ||	  Love it!  I really love this locket, but it is smaller than I had anticipated it being. I didn't look at the specs closely, I guess. It is smaller than the size of a dime...actually, it covers Eisenhower's head and that is about it. So it is quite small, and I don't know if there is anything that will actaully fit inside the locket, but I really do love it. The clover looks like it is real, so I thought that was cool too. I would buy it again given the chance, but I would like it a little more if it was just a bit bigger. <end>  Ugh.  I loved this piece until the clover face came unglued. Now it's a locket with a bunch of glue on the face. Sigh. <end>  Four leaf clover necklace  this locket is just beautiful!!! But the little tiny link that holds it to the chain is very fragil...if you dont replace that right away, your going to loose it. I love the locket! <end>  very cute, but not well made.  My father bought this for my daughter for a Yule gift. It was lovely, and she couldn't wait to wear it. Unfortunately, when she tried to open it the four leaf clover part popped off. The part went missing, and now we have a blank locket with a glue spot.If it had stayed together I would have given it a four to 5 star rating. It is a very cute piece that is perfect for a young lady. <end>  Ok for the price  I bought this for my girlfriend because she wanted a locket. It is extremely small, and basically a persons head cut out of a wallet sized picture MIGHT fit in it. But she loves it. I've been told that it closes tight enough so that water doesn't get into it if you forget to take it off, and it does look nice.The chain is very weak, broke the first day. We just went and bought a cheap chain (you can get chains for like $3 at superstores), so it really wasn't a big deal. <end>  Lucky Pendant  I bought this as a gift and the person who received it loved it. It was too small to have ingraved at the mall, but other than that, it was beautiful. <end>  sure, now that it's $20 I guess...  a friend of mine gave one of these to me randomly after a road trip. to be quite honest, I thought it was a gas station souvenir, because it was so cheaply made, but I loved it! it's tiny, delicate and adorable...and sitting in my car in a cup holder since the chain broke after wearing it for 2 days. <end>  Great Buy!  necklace is wonderful. i purchased it for my friend really likes it! i already knew how small it was so there were no problems. the clasp works fine be sure to always check out the feedback, when ordering any thing on line even if its not from this site  D shipping was great came early. would buy from this company again. <end>  Recommend  I was really impressed with this locket. It is small, but cute and the clover is nicely attached. I would recommend this highly unless you need a locket with a large area for photographs. <end>  Cute and stylish!  I really like this little locket. I read the reviews ahead of time, so I immediately moved it to a different chain. Haven't had the chain breaking issue.  ) It is VERY VERY small, though. Small enough that I don't know if you could actually even fit the ashes of a four-leaf clover in the compartment.  P Two of these would make cute earrings. ;) <end>  ugg  I thought it was so pretty and charming right up to when the clover fell of and was never seen again. It lasted maybe a month. 2 stars because it is pretty. <end>  loved the look but fell apart  i had bought the heart shaped version from the store, after a while the acrylic that held the clover onto the metal, turned yellow and fell off. i as actually quite sad, i loved it, but also in the stores it is cheaper than here... <end>  Very cute!  This locket is adorable. It IS really tiny, but even on a bigger person, it looks great as a sort of day-to-day piece of jewelry. I guess it might be too flimsy for a kid, but I've had mine for a few weeks now, and I've probably worn it 10 times or so. I have not had any breakage issues or popping off of the front. I think one should inspect it carefully before wearing it, to see if anything is loose, but I haven't had any trouble like some other reviewers have. I absolutely love it! It is the most fun piece of jewelry I've gotten in a long time! <end>  four leaf locket  Very nice locket perfect gift for my girlfriend. Very small locket just what i wanted. The only difficluty you will have is trimming the tiny pictures to fit inside of the locket. <end>  four leaf clover  not worth the money spent, cheap chain, will be removing and replacing it with a more attractive and sturdier chain <end>  Chain broke on the first day  I bought this necklace as a gift for my sister. The chain is very thin and it broke the first day she wore it. The pendant is nice but hardly serves its purpose without a necklace from which to hang. <end>  Sterling Silver???  I had this item on my wish list and was very excited when someone purchased it for me, however after wearing it for a few short hours I found that this was not something to be happy about. I am very sensitive to metals but since this was sterling silver I thought that it would be ok, however I broke out in a really awful rash and now have a necklace that I can no longer wear. So basically BUYER BEWARE! Don't make the mistake I made and end up like me! <end>
 B000NJFSDM  Sterling Silver Star of David Pendant, 1 1/8 inch tall ||	  Nice value, pretty little star  I wanted something smaller and unique and this fit the bill. Good weight for its size, diamond cuts give it sparkle, and it looks very feminine and pretty on, either over a sweater or on bare cleavage. Would be awesome for a teen or anyone who likes a smaller piece with lots of shine. <end>
 B000NJFSDW  Sterling Silver Chinese Character for BEAUTIFUL Pendant, 1 3/8 inch tall ||	  Girlfriend loves it!  I got this pendant for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it.

 B000NJFSM8  Sterling Silver Cross Pendant, 1 1/2 inch tall ||	  perfect light weight cross  This cross is plain but simply lovely. This seller has very high quality products and very quick service. I purchase from them all the time and have not been disappointed! <end>
 B000NJHDM6  Sterling Silver Nail Cross (Crucifixion of Jesus) Pendant, 1 3/8 inch tall ||	  Beautiful Nail Style Cross  I purchased this cross as a gift for myself for Christmas it was one of four cross's I bought myself and I am truly glad I did It is so beautiful, It means so much to me to be able to share my faith with others.When ever someone notices my cross it is and instant conversation starter and of course the conversation always turns to religion,we talk about where we go to church It gives you a chance that you might not otherwise get to talk to someone about God. and you never know when that might just be what that other person needs.So buy it because it might suprise you and help you reach someone, by it because it is a very nice way to share your faith and buy it because it is beautiful. <end>  Beautiful cross  I bought this cross for my husband and it arrived very quickly and is beautiful! The chain was a bit small, but I had also ordered him a 30 inch 1.2 medium box chain because he likes a longer chain and it was perfect for it. He gets a lot of compliments on it. <end>  can't trust what you read or see in 4 this one...  the cross is really 1 1/2 tall...the ring that holds the cross to the chain is a cheap wire.i am not happy. <end>  Perfect cross for men  The coss is really nice and the picture doesn't do it justice. It was just the right size and weight. <end>  Cross is ok. Chain is totally useless!  I ordered this item recently and it arrived promptly. However, the chain was as thin as I've ever seen and immediately broke. Be prepared to order a chain upon receiving this item as the one it comes up with is completely useless! <end>  just as described  My son ordered the cross as a replacement for one in which the chain kept breaking. He has been very pleased with this product and it looks exactly as described. <end>
 B000NJJ14E  Sterling Silver Chinese Character for LOVE Pendant, 1 1/16 inch tall ||	  beautiful charm  This charm was much prettier than it appeared in the photo.

I would definitely order from this company again. <end>
 B000NJJ1I0  Sterling Silver Celtic Cross Pendant, 1 5/8 inch tall ||	  Celtic cross  I purchased this for my husband and wished I had been advised of the length of the silver chain. As it turns out, the chain was too short for my husband and I had to purchase a separate chain. The cross is very beautiful and very authentic. It might have been better to not include a chain and just purchase a separate one. <end>  No regrets at all  Arrived promptly and well before the estimated arrival date in excellent condition, I purchased a seperate silk chain to go with it as the one that comes with it is short and flimsy but I have worn it for only one day and have recieved sevral compliments and personally think it is an attractive piece and a good buy. <end>  nice product  I got this for my oldest son(24) and he really likes it. I did see it and it appears to be good quality. <end>  Nice pendant  The pendant is very nice, and the person I bought it for was very happy with it. <end>
 B000NJN1JU  Amazon.com  Deluxe Navy Military Ring  Sports &amp; Outdoors ||	  Don't buy from ARMY Universe  The stone fell out of this ring about 5 weeks after it was received. Apparently it had exceeded the 30 day return date, but Army Universe agreed to correct the mistake. The ring was returned to Army Universe at my expense. Army Universe claims to have repaired and returned the ring, but the returned ring has never been received. Not a high quality ring because the stone fell out and I will never order from Army Universe again. They refuse to correct the mistake. <end>

Purchased additional rings in recent days as momentos to my comrades in arms while deployed in support of OEF. Have yet to receive any comments regarding the grade of the 18k plating and the durability of the ring. Overall, very happy with the purchases and for the price its a great gift! Most rings arrived well before the the 18-32 days of estimated arrival time from the US to a remote post in Afghanistan... <end>  Special forces ring  Yes it looks good but this one i purchased lost it shine as it may have been a manufacturing default <end>

This made a great present, plus NETAYA and amazon gave me great updates so I knew the delivery was prompt along the way. <end>  My new favorite necklace!!  I LOVE this necklace!!

 B000NNTUO6  Genuine Freshwater Cultured Pearl and Red Genuine Sea Bamboo Coral Chip Stretch Bracelet ||	  Red Wrist at Night, Lady's Delight  Exactly as pictured and exactly as expected. A nice bauble for around $10.00 (including shipping). They are small chips (to repeat from another review) but there are enough of them to give the bracelet substance. The pearls are more like "seed pearls" -- very small, and not uniform in shape, but still proportionate for the bracelet. <end>  great site  always on time, efficient and as advertised. they are very small chips, but appropriate for the price. have used them many times for pieces to incorporate in my jewlery <end>

The chain is very thin, which makes this beautiful, the clover and peridot compliment each other very well. I bought this in honor of my grandmother's memorial, she was a very proud Irish woman! I never take this off. It's not cheaply made at all, very strong and durable (I have two toddlers who pull at it when I hold them).

I'm very pleased! <end>  my girlfriend loves it  I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. It's just like the picture and it's cool how it clips in the front so she doesn't have to worry about the clasp falling all around and try to keep it in the back.

It's really high quality and I've had so many compliments on it already. I like the way the clasp hooks in front...that's really cool. I am very happy with this purchase!" <end>
 B000NOHHYA  Cushion-cut Amethyst & Diamond Pendant - JewelryWeb ||	  Looks fantastic on the web, in person not so amazing.  Photograph of the item is stunning however; upon opening the package the actual item looks extremely small. I have a hard time believing the before discount price is correct.

 B000NPUYO4  Sterling Silver Oval Cut Baltic Amber Ring Genuine Size 8.5 ||	  Lovely Ring!  This ring is beautiful!! It's a feminine design which is exactly what I was looking for. Most Amber rings are artsy looking or modern, but this ring is just what I was looking for. More beautiful then the picture in my opininion. And they wrapped it in the cutest gift box. Adorable! <end>  lovely, comfortable, good quality  This is a lovely piece of amber, with a very complimentary setting. It's comfortable to wear and is of good quality. It came in a very nice presentation box, which would have been perfect as it came for a gift. I was happy to have given myself this gift! <end>  Almost Perfect  The ring itself is very pretty! I really think it's very elegant, the oval isn't too big (and I have thin finger), and it's well crafted around the amber.Here are the complaints  my particular ring was a disappointment because the "flecks" one finds in amber are almost non-existant in my ring -- I count three flecks. The rest of the ring is clear and empty.The amber I received it honey amber, it's not dark like the picture suggests.Lastly, the box was poor quality and I could see the glue running off the side.HOWEVER, while I wasn't happy with the flecks (the box isn't a big deal to me, or the color), I wear this ring all the time because it really is beautiful! I think would give it 5 stars if not for the flecks. <end>  amber ring  Beautiful ring... I was very pleased with the color and quality of this piece of jewelry. I would highly recommend it to others. <end>  great ring for a great price  I thought that it would be more substantial, even after reading the reviews. I do love the look and I think it looks more expensive than what I paid. I leave it on all the time because it is so light and comfortable. I am really happy with this purchase. <end>  Balatic amber ring  The amber is fabulous, it almost matches my earings. However I find the band a little bit too thin for my taste, but who can complaint about the price and the service? Both were great. Thank you..... <end>  Amber Ring  This is a lovely ring. Everytime I wear it people ask where I got it. The silver is well crafted and the amber is everything you could hope for. I just wish I could find earrings to match. It runs true to size. It does look better in person. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful !  My husband "Doc" bought this for me on a "Just Because".The picture does not do this ring justice.It is wonderful. I love feminine jewely with a vintage look and this piece blends in my collection perfectly. The amber is a real eye catcher. I had my jeweler look at it, and his price would have been much higher. The service was quick and the box was gift ready. I will order from Gem Avenue again. <end>
 B000NSPT8M  Sterling Silver "Survivor" Pearl Breast Cancer Awareness Charm Bracelet ||	  Great gift!  I bought this for a friend who is a two time breast cancer survivor.

 B000NT0D2S  Sterling Silver Necklace Set Made with Swarovski Elements 4mm Faux Pearl ||	  Princess jewelry  For the little princess in your life. Quality craftsmanship and beautiful pieces of jewelry. I bought these for a friends one year old. These are not going to fall apart if they are yanked on and the necklace was small enough so that it didn't hang down and cause a choking hazard. Great keepsake pieces. Thanks! <end>  Cheap looking and very poor quality  This jewlery set looks like jewlery one could purchase at a Dollar Store. Very poor quality. I send it back to the seller as soon as I received it. <end>
 B000NTCJNO  PalmBeach Jewelry 6.25 TCW Emerald-Cut Channel-Set Blue Genuine Topaz Sterling Silver Ring ||	  Grandpa's favorite  I torture my grandpa on the subject of rings, but I consider my ring addiction the same as his gun collecting; so we're even. Instead of reacting to the my "show-and-tell" as a nusance, he actually complimented this ring as being his favorite! I don't get too many compliments yet, but I just recently got it. My grandpa's approval is a great sign. <end>

 B000NTSK64  14k White Gold Round Diamond Ring (1/6 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  I LOVE IT  I am so excited about this ring. It is so dainty and sparkly. It is exactly what I wanted. I have small hands and usually do not like to wear jewelry. This ring is so perfect because it is small and light weight...I hardly notice it...until it catches the light...and then it just sparkles. I love it!!! <end>  Regular Product  After 4 months of use, one of the stones were lost. I don't know any other person who would take care of her jewerly than my wife. I a shame i couldn't get anything better for her. <end>
 B000NTWE20  14k Yellow Gold 3-Stone Round Diamond Ring (1 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Good for the price  As a gift, it is still good. The stones are really the size you could imagine. The style is good also. Pay with the pice, I am quite happy. <end>  Nice For The Price, 3-Stone Diamond Ring, sz 7 14k yg 1.00ct  When I saw this in the 70% off or more listing of Amazon clearance jewelry (the price at the time was $315) I was somewhat skeptical about the quality; it's listed as a clarity of I2-I3, which can often be very dark, cloudy and not-nice-looking diamonds. I ordered it because I wanted to see the ring in person; Amazon has an excellent return policy.Please note that the diamonds in the ring I received do have some noticable inclusions under 10X magnification with a loupe--one side stone would be I1, the center stone I2, and the other side stone I3--the flaws are near or under facets, so aren't noticable to the naked eye. Overall the cut of each diamond is excellent. The diamonds in my ring are also much brighter white than pictured on the product page, which is a plus. Set in white gold the diamonds might look darker. In yellow gold they appear white. Total carat weight might be slightly under 1.00, which is usually acceptable in the jewelry trade.If you've shopped in brick and mortar department and jewelry stores or have compared prices online at other internet shopping sites, the average price of 1.00 carat total weight three stone diamond rings with similar color and clarity is around $1,000. Prices vary anywhere from $795 to $1,450, and some run as high as $1,900. Amazon's "regular" price or retail value of $2,700 is definately inflated. I can't imagine anyone paying $2,700 for this ring, but I feel I got a great buy at $315.This is NOT the ring to buy if you insist on top quality diamonds, yet keep in mind very few folks walk around with a jeweler's loupe to check out others jewelry. Overall a terrific buy for a significant three stone diamond ring at a rock bottom price... no pun intended. <end>  a steal for the price!  i got this ring for my birthday and i cannot believe how beautiful it is! diamonds are very large compared to what i expected, and the never stop sparkling. i am a 7 but the ring seems a tad large for a 7, but not a big deal. highly recommend! <end>  Wife loved it.  The Mrs absolutely loved this ring. It appears to very well made and the diamonds are very clear and brilliant. <end>
 B000NTYOIM  14k Gold Princess-Cut 3-Stone Diamond Ring (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Very SMALL  I guess I shouldn't have been disappointed but I am. I purchased it because I am a very small person and I thought that this would be the perfect size. However, it's much smaller than it appears. I wear about a size 3 and the 3-prong diamond barely covers 1/4 of my finger. The gold does not appear to be 14k either as this is really light-weight and a very light yellow shade. I almost thought that I bought a white gold band. This ring has a very flimsy feel to it and it's cheaper than I would have imagined. Not to mention that the ring was an imperfect circle. I wouldn't be surprised if it bent if I squeezed it. I am even more disappointed because Amazon did not send a certificate with it like they did when I purchased my previous ring. I do not recommend this ring to anyone. It looks dinky and you're better off purchasing a 1/4 ct solitaire. This ring just doesn't look right. <end>
 B000NUTPMQ  Sterling Silver Round Citrine Gemstone Wavy Shaped Rhodium Plated 1.5 inch Long Pendant charm ||	  WORTH MORE THAN THE PRICE!  Bought for myself on a whim while purchasing a gift to avoid paying freight ;-) Very pretty, great price. Included nice gift box. <end>

The deep blue of the lapis wolves that run around the ring, glows against the sterling silver background. I am very happy with it and I would unhesitatingly recommend it. <end>
 B000NV2PTK  Sterling Silver Genuine Blue Topaz stone emerald cut lever back leverback Earrings ||	  waste of time and money  I ordered this earrings to go with blue topaz pendant that I own. The earrings that I received was such a bad quality it looked clear rather than blue. I contaceted this seller BUT it seems they not only sells the horrible quality stuff but don't even respond to customer's e-meil. Beware customers they charge $5.95 s&h that they don't refund so even if it's not your fault they will wrip you off anyway! <end>  blue topaz earrings  These were given to my daughter for Christmas, they arrived in a little velvet like bag and are very nice. Good product, good price, fast shipment. Very happy <end>

Silverspeck.com was very reliable with quick delivery and the earrings look great. I would recommend them to everyone who likes leverback earrings. <end>  Blue  These earrings are a beautiful shade of blue. I wear a lot of blue and they go with many different shades of blue. <end>  lovely earrings  I loved these earrings but they were much more purplish than the photo showed and I couldn't use them so I had to return them. But sure do wish I could have kept them!!! <end>
 B000NV7THI  14k White Gold 3-Stone Diamond Ring (3/4 cttw, H Color, SI2 Clarity), Size 5 ||	  Oh my how you sparkle! &lt;3  My husband (married 12 years, this year) bought this beauty for me for Valentine's Day. It sparkles like mad, the diamonds are just gorgeous and I find myself falling in love with this ring more and more every time I glance down at my hand and it blinds me with sparkle. 101% recommendation from me. <end>
 B000NV7X9M  14k Gold 7-Stone Diamond Ring (1 cttw, H Color, SI2 Clarity) ||	  Quality  The product came exceptionally packaged. The ring itself turned out to be better than we expected. The stones are clear and has great fire and sparkle. My fiancee' can't take her eyes off of it!!Thanks. <end>
 B000NV9K3E  14k White Gold 3-Stone Diamond Ring (1/6 cttw, H Color, SI2 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Terrible  I got this ring recently from Amazon and its tiny. Absolutly tiny. Sent it straight back. The pictures do not even closely reflect how small the ring actually is. I and my girlfriend were very annoyed at the disapointing size of the ring. <end>
 B000NV9OAS  14k White Gold 7-Stone Diamond Ring (1/6 cttw, H Color, SI2 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  Petite and pretty  The diamonds are good in the 3Cs. The ring is very petite and works perfectly as a stacker or side ring. I bought the ring on sale and feel it was better valued on a sale price that on the original price. I wear it as a stacker to my engagement ring which has a very thick band and large center stone. It does not compete with that ring and is a nice complement. It also looks very nice in between my two 2mm bands for when I want to switch my rings up a bit. But again, it is a very small, petite ring. It would make a nice promise ring for a teen or early 20 something. <end>
 B000NVPH86  KKPS043 6 Princess Amethyst Gemstone Pendant Sterling Silver charm Pendent ||	  Amazed and surprised  I buy lots of jewelry from TV and the internet. I have also sent lots of stuff back because it wasn't the quality, size or "prettiness" that I expected when I ordered it, or didn't feel that the price was worth it. Well, when I opened this package up, I was amazed at the quality, style, size and design and completely surprised by the brilliant color. The price is more than worth the value and quality. I am a very tall lady and this piece looks fantastic on me! I'm thrilled with it and am pleased to be able to give this piece 5 sincere stars. <end>
 B000NVPNP8  Cute 9 MM Fresh Water Pearl Peridot Sterling Silver Stud Post Earrings ||	  Pretty but too large.  I ordered these for a gift and they are quite pretty. The stones have a nice sparkle to them and they don't look cheap. Although, I think, the whole earring is a bit too large. Also, the pearls are not quite the same size and shape and are not totally round. If that does not bother you then you will like these. <end>  Lovely  Very charming and lovely earrings. They are a tad on the large side but elegant. <end>

I got it in a size 5.5, which fits my right second finger. It's a perfect size for my tiny hands. It's slender, unobtrusive, and very very shiny. The gemstone always sparkles. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  This ring is so beautiful..It looks great on your finger...I want to get it in different stones..Fun to wear..you will find your self sharing at it alot!! Do buy this ring!! You won't regret it.... <end>  Adorable Ring  This ring is really well-crafted, just adorable, perfect size, not too big and nicely polished. Great gift for a dolphin lover or anyone who likes sterling silver jewelry. <end>  Nice product.

Do recommend for animal lovers. <end>  cool  thanks to the promt shipment I was able to have my ring for my anniversary and that is what was the most important thing. Thank you very much. <end>  Great purchase for the occasion at hand.  They were extremely fast in the order and I'm glad I got it for my best friend on Valentines Day. She loves dolphins, jewelry, and the color purple. While I was afraid that it might take too long to get here, I received it within days. I'm extremely content with it. <end>  Impecable ring!  I purchased this for my girlfriend and she went totaly nuts about it! I was impressed on how shiny and polished the silver was, looks better in person than the picture, gift wrapping was impecable and overall this is a killer gift. Absolutely recomended!! <end>

 B000NVV97E  AugustinaJewelry AAA Quality Round 7.5-8mm Akoya SaltWater cultured White Pearl Earrings with 18K White Gold Mount ||	  Surprising quality  It's always a bit of a risk to buy jewelry on line, but my mom lives across the country from me and I didn't have time to buy a gift in a store and then get to the post office in time for Mothers Day. I knew she wanted pearl earrings so I did a little research, checked reviews and bought these. I seriously lucked out. These are gorgeous, well-made and very high quality pearls. My mom was thrilled. Whew. <end>  DO NOT BUY!!! - Pretty, But Cheaply Made  Unfortunately I cannot re-rate this item but if I could it would get one star. These earrings are quite beautiful, but they are cheaply made. One of the post came out a month or two after I purchased them. My first thought is that will happen. I shipped them back and the jeweler fixed the post. Just last week, the post came out of the other one. I had to super-glue the post back in. Now this gift for my girlfriend looks cheap and tawdry, because it keeps falling apart. Do not waste your money with this item. Spend the little extra and go through a reputable jeweler. <end>  Pretty but broken  The earrings have a lovely lustere and are 7.5 mm. The post pulled out of the pearl when I tried to pull the back off. I should have sent them back but I epoxy-ed the post on instead. <end>  This oyster delivered fantastic pearls  On-line jewelry is often a leap of faith; this supplier has strengthened mine; color, quality, finish, all were much more than promised and even more than expected. I know I'll be back. <end>
 B000NVVY10  14k Yellow Gold Multi-Gemstone Necklace ||	  Poor Quality for The Price!  14k Yellow Gold Multi-Gemstone NecklaceI was initially excited to receive this product. I thought I would receive something feminine and dainty. The whole product (chain and "gems") were of poor quality. The chain specifically was more like 15" (the size and quality you would give a little girl) and the "gems" were nothing more than cheap plastic! Nothing at all like the photo.Frankly, I am shocked that Amazon would sell something of obvious poor workmanship. It makes me hesitant to purchase any more jewelry from Amazon. <end>
 B000NVXYCM  14k Yellow Gold Amethyst Necklace, 16" ||	  Beautiful, BUT...  Two complaints The necklace was an absolute tangled mess when it arrived. It took me quite a while to carefully untangle it without breaking the delicate chain.On one of the "drops," the number of links to the larger stone were reduced and the smaller gem was missing. It had obviously never been attached. I'm returning the necklace for a full refund. (Amazon will not allow for an exchange on this item).I will order the necklace again, BUT if there are missing stones I suggest Amazon reconsider doing business with these folks. It is absurd to pay this price and have a blatant defect like this.My wife's 50th birthday is in two days. I've explained to her that her gift was sent back because it was defective and that it will be two to four weeks for the reordered gift to arrive. I'm so very thankful that I'm married to a gracious and loving woman.___________________________________________Update  I tried again. The second necklace came with a different shipping configuration, which seemed to nicely resolve the issue of the necklace being all tangled up. THIS necklace was perfect. Sheesh. I had no idea my original review would knock ~[...] off the price I paid for this item. <end>  Beautiful Necklace  This is a very beautiful necklace and looks exactly like the picture. It goes very well with an evening gown. I have received several compliments for this. This came in a velvet box and came in perfect condition. My 6 year old also wears it quite a lot and it withstood the rough handling by a kid too! I would definitely recommend this necklace. I liked it so much that I want to get this kind of necklace in another gem stones like sapphires. <end>
 B000NVZJCU  14k Amethyst Station Necklace ||	  pretty but knotted on arival  Its a nice necklace, it was really knotted up on arival as the other reviewer stated, so I wasn't surprised. The stones hang a little off-center, but doubled it looks ok. Stones are beautiful though. <end>  Pretty, but!!  The necklace arrived today. It may turn out to be rather pretty, if I am ever able to get untangled. It arrived in a mixed up ball. Amazon did a poor job of quality control. It is so bad that I'm not sure it wasn't done on purpose. <end>
 B000NW23EG  14k White Gold Marquise Solitaire Diamond Ring (.05 ct, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  Nice but small  the ring is really nice, the setting and the stone look really good. The diamond itself is tiny, but that's what you would expect because of the carat. Now the problem with mine is that the stone got lost 2 hours after I gave it to my wife. I'll see what I can do with amazon as far as warranty on the item. <end>
 B000NW3F5M  14k Yellow Gold Round 4-Prong Solitaire Diamond Ring (1/2 ct, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  LOVE IT  after reading about other rings i saw here the reviews scared me a little. but for the money this item gives you the best bang for your buck. the band is as thick as the upper part not thin and ready to break. the decription was nice because you know the color and cut, not all items advertised do that. so i was very happy to see i got exactly what i saw on this site as advertised. great place to shop for everything !!!!!thanks Amazons walker <end>

 B000NW4HKO  10k White Gold Round 4-Prong Solitaire Diamond Ring (3/4 ct, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 6 ||	  Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)  Before buying this piece, take careful note of the listed information about the product. The grade is I2-I3, which is the last step before the diamond is broken up into tiny pieces for cheap jewelry at Wal-Mart or ground up into industrial abrasives. The color is at a level just barely acceptable for "white" jewelry.In one respect, you do have to give the seller some credit for honesty. I can't imagine they are inflating the specifications that much for stones that bad. However, this piece gets one star for that joke of a list price. It simply is not realistic, and is listed solely to make you think you are getting a "good deal." If anybody ever actually paid that price, they might as well have been robbed. I know that inflated "list prices" are common in the jewelry industry, but this one takes the cake!SirWired <end>
 B000NW58TI  14k Yellow Gold Lemon Quartz Briolette Drop Necklace ||	  Lemon Drop Delight  I got this pendant for Christmas and it is very pretty. The problem was when I went to take it off the chain broke at the catch. I was able to put a jump ring on it and it seems to be just fine. This is a nice necklace just beware of the chain. <end>  Lovely piece of jewelry  I was skeptical at first to purchase the product b/c it is heavily discounted. Thought there might be some major defect. However, it's a really lovely piece. The quartz is clear and beautifully cut, and the chain is nice and feminine..hopefully it's sturdy too (but I've only been wearing it for 2 days. <end>
 B000NW5J6A  14k White Gold Marquise Solitaire Diamond Ring (.05 ct, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity), Size 7 ||	  Nice but small  the ring is really nice, the setting and the stone look really good.

 B000NW5JHO  10k Yellow Gold Round 4-Prong Solitaire Diamond Ring (1/4 ct, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity), Size 9 ||	  .  excelente producto de calidad recomendando como lo estaba buscando excelente servicio de envio a miami y recibido a tiempo estimado <end>  SHE LOVED IT!  Yes, although it may be a small ring, it's a classic. Solitaire diamonds on a round setting, are things we USED to see in movies. LOL. Needless, to say she loved the ring. So, it was worth it. Last minute deal, but worth every penny. <end>
 B000NW6NQU  14k Yellow Gold Round 4-Prong Solitaire Diamond Ring (3/4 ct, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity), Size 8 ||	  perfect!  this ring has great color, and even though the clarity isn't the best you can get... the one i got is awesome for I1-I2! i cant notice any spots and trust me i have been staring at it an awful lot... ;) very happy that i am now engaged to my sweetie, with the perfect ring! <end>  Affordable and Pretty  I received my ring in the mail yestersay. The cut and color are very nice and it has a lot of sparkle in the light. As I expected, there are flaws that are very visible when I look at it closely. There are a lot of tiny black spots on the inside, which aren't very noticeable. Two spots, however, are larger and near the surface...the setting helps to hide them a bit, but once I knew where they were I could spot them immediately every time I look at it. However, if people look at it in the light, the cut helps to cover the flaws, and I don't think anyone would notice them unless they really took a close look at the ring. I think for the price, it was a good buy. If you don't want any noticeable flaws, however, get a diamond with better clarity. <end>  Cheap Diamond....  I got this in mail and returned in the next day, The diamond looks so cheap, a lot of black dots inside, easy for you to see by eyes. I'm not gonna buy any diamonds from amazon any more,kind of waste my time & money. <end>  Amazon is amazing!  I love this ring, it's so brilliant and beautiful, I love to watch it sparkle! Since we ordered online I immediately took it to a jeweler and had them check that the diamond was in fact real. Of course it is and I couldn't possibly be happier. It is so clear and gorgeous I'm still amazed by the price I got it for. I love it! I can't wait to marry my sweetie in Maui! I will definitely order more jewelry from Amazon in the future!! <end>
 B000NWA2GW  Sterling Silver, Freshwater Cultured Pearl and Cubic Zirconia Drop Pendant, 18" ||	  Looks very cheap  This looks much prettier in the picture. I had initially bought it for a friend for Christmas, but ended up giving it as a gift to my eight year old daughter. It almost looks like something you would find in the toy department. I have ordered other jewelry from Amazon and loved it, so one dud is not bad. <end>
 B000NWOCF4  Sterling Silver Genuine Amethyst Stone Emerald cut LeverBack Lever Back Earrings ||	  Sparkle Just Enough  I've always been conservative about what I wear, but as I've gotten into my senior years, I've decided to have a little more fun. These earring are just what I was looking for. They arrived promptly, exactly as described and photographed. The stones are an appealing shade, and the lever backs feel sturdy and work well. The earrings dangle just enough to be noticed against my white hair, and I have been pleased to receive several compliments already. <end>  Great earrings!  These are great earrings-the stones are great quality. I liked these earrings so much that I bought them in 4 other colors. I have purchased them for presents for others, and get compliments all the time. <end>  PRETTY  The shade of purple was not as deep as the necklace I have but they're very pretty and I definitely intend to wear them. <end>
 B000NWOPYW  Large Sterling Silver CZ Leverback Lever Back Earrings ||	  Happy Customer!  Had to contact customer service regarding the earrings, and they were very efficient about send out another pair for me. I ahve worn them a couple of times so far and have gotten so many compliments. They are nice and simple, can be worn with anything. <end>
 B000NWTQIC  Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Black and White Flower Ring, Size 7 ||	  good for the price  it has great style but it gets caught on stuff and then it will bend out of shape. it is pretty easy to bend back but it won't last long. <end>  Very pretty, very easily broken  Twenty dollars for a ring does not guarantee its quality, but it shouldn't mean it's a piece of junk either. For the first week, I wore this ring happily and was impressed with its comfort (I would afraid it would be stabby) and attractiveness. Since the two flowers are not connected, I thought I might be able to adjust the band size slightly. A small amount of manipulation later...crack. I didn't break it, but it was clear that the ring was not at full strength. I kept wearing it, expecting it to split in half, and it would be my fault (though I would have expected something a little stronger).Then, about a week after that, I put on the ring in the morning and noticed one of the stones had fallen out. Now the ring is double broken. Lame. Considering my cheaper everyday ring, theMarvelous .925 Sterling Silver Band Princess Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Slim Promise Ring, has stood up to far worse mishaps, I think that the price on this ring is too high, and the production just isn't a decent quality at all. Unless the price drops by half (at least), save your money. <end>  Beautiful!  This ring is so pretty. It looks exactly how it is shown in the picture and it looks really great on your hand. <end>  cubic zirconia ring  I adore this ring so much, it has gorgeous flowers on it for a good look. <end>  ring  Its a pretty ring, it looks excatly like the picture. It is really easy to bend. I let my friend see it and she accidently bent the ring. I was able to bend it back into shape. thats the only problem with it. <end>

 B000NWVX1K  AugustinaJewelry AAA Quality Round 5.5-6mm Akoya SaltWater cultured Black Pearl Earrings with 18K White Gold Mount ||	  Lovely earrings  The earrings are lovely and they shipped extremely fast. I am very pleased with them  ) <end>  Oh Poo!  These really let me down. Just so people know...they are actually black (not like natural black pearls). They are dyed. So, if you were hoping they'd be dark grey with purple like real black pearls, you're out of luck. If you want BLACK pearls then by all means pick these up. However, they were great about accepting my return. <end>
 B000NWXBDI  Sterling Silver Fleur-De-Lis Pendant, 16" ||	  an OK necklace  The necklace is OK. The chain is definitely nice-very delicate small links- the chain is essentially a choker, which isn't the most comfortable in a chain link. The pendant itself is extremely thin, with virtually no weight to it at all. I was expecting it to be a bit more substantial. The packaging was nice- it came in a navy blue velveteen pouch in a navy blue box- however the pouch was a poor choice of packaging because the chain was so tangled up it took forever to undo. It would have been nicer in a display box. Overall it was worth the money-but don't expect to be wowed. <end>
 B000NWXBG0  Sterling Silver Flower Ring, Size 6 ||	  Love it!  This is a beautiful ring. Very comfortable to wear and striking. It's substantial and not at all flimsy. <end>
 B000NZ1DJO  Set of 2 Pink Ribbon Embroidered Cloth Wristbands for Breast Cancer Awareness (Pink and White Mix of Colors) ||	  Tough enough to wear pink? You bet!  Great product to support a fantastic cause! I worked all summer out by a pool in Las Vegas, and often used wristbands to wipe the sweat from my head and face. After wearing the pink breast cancer awareness wristbands, it made a lot of our customers aware that us dudes are on board with the fight against breast cancer! <end>  We didn't received the correct products.  We ordered all "pink" wristbands but we received 1/2 of them in white and 1/2 of them in pink. Due to the timeframe, we were not able to exchange or return them. We had to use them anyway even though they were the wrong colors. <end>  Disappointment  items were great but not what I ordered. Buyer beware. I ordered all pink got 1/2 white 1/2 pink now i know why there store name is My Jewel THIEF. They are THIEFS. These items were for (60) 12-14 year old boys & they are so disappointed. Big mistake to order from this company. <end>  Beware, You can get pink or white, at the sellers discretion.  Beware - I wanted, needed and ordered what I thought were going to be "Pink" wristbands, but half my order was "White". I reviewed my order confirmation which said "Pink." I contacted the seller and they told me too bad they ship what ever they have in stock to keep their prices down. You get what they send, no returns. This product should state set of 2, Pink ribbon embroidered Cloth wristbands, Pink and/or White. <end>  Bands But No Music !  For a little over two dollars this wristband package is a good deal. We received two bands, both white with the pink, embroidered ribbon. The absorbent bands are a little snug, but with their soft elasticity they fit Mrs. Spudman's petite wrists perfectly. Both bands come with plenty of loose threads that have to be plucked or cut off, but for the low price this is to be expected.Our two Pink Ribbon wristbands were made in Yiwu,China. <end>  Breast Cancer Awareness wristband review  The wristbands are of good quality and the football players liked them. The only drawback was they came half white and pink and I needed all pink.I think they should be sold only solid colors and can be ordered mixed if wanted that way otherwise liked! <end>  Pink Ribbon Cloth Wristbands  This was a good purchase my daughter made to go along with the Breast Cancer knee socks she purchased and the shoe laces. They were for awareness during her basketball games. <end>  fast shipment. items not made as well as they seem.  the first day i received them i wore one and it had a little snag. i do not see these lasting long for me as i have to wear them everyday. they are very cute, and will be great for someone who wears occasionally. <end>  Disappointed  We ordered these arm bands for my son who wanted pink. He received white. As listing notes that he will receive a mixed assortment, we assumed at least one would be pink. Contacted the seller who insisted that the listing was accurate with what we received. Buyer beware of this seller. <end>  You get what you pay for  This product is pretty awesome for what you pay for it - I'm not even sure my price paid covered the cost to ship them to me. I was a little caught off guard as I only received two white bands. I think I assumed I was getting two pairs (4 total) based on the photo but after reading the description more carefully it was clear it was only one pair (2 bands). These are going to work great for my upcoming half marathon and at this price I can pitch them halfway through the race if needed and not feel bad about it. <end>  Mr.  I was very satified with this merchandise. I purchased the item for the purpose that it was Breast cancer awarness month. I wore it while playing my softball games. What I liked about it was the quality of the wristband. It was comfortable, thick, well fitted, width was excellent and the price was hard to turn down. The opposing team complimented me on the wristbands and they stated that they look great. The funny thing my own teammates didn't say anything, but they were staring at them. I believe they were thinking to do the same.Thank you for your support. <end>
 B000NZT8N2  14k Yellow Gold Diamond Star Pendant (1/4 cttw) ||	  Very pleasantly surprised!  I purchased this as a gift and liked it so much that I purchased another for myself. The diamonds sparkle very nicely and are nicely set, far better quality than I expected for the price. The chain is very delicate - so take care with it. The pendant is 13/16" across and is about 1/8" high/thick (nice filigree). <end>  Star necklace  I live in Virginia and we are considered the star city of the south. Many wonderful compliments on this. <end>
 B000NZT8NC  14k White Gold Diamond Star Earrings (1/5 cttw, I-J Color, I2 Clarity) ||	  You will be a Shining Star in these earrings  Just got these earrings after waiting almost 2 months for them. They are soo much more beautiful then I ever imagined. I got the yellow gold. Which would be my choice because u can see white gold around the stars and you get the best of both worlds.Totally worth the money. They are bigger then I thought they would be. and the diamonds are not skimpy.I may just get them in white gold next. ;-) <end>  14k white gold star earrings  I just love my new earrings. They are perfect, and I got fast delivery. Couldn't be more pleased. <end>  Nice item  These earrings are nice; they are smaller and the diamonds are much smaller than I expected but they are okay. They are a great purchase for a teenager or someone who likes really small diamonds. Great price. <end>  Absolutely gorgeous  These earrings are just lovely. The diamonds are clear and sparkle. They are a perfect size, not too big and not too small. I got them in the white gold and they are just beautiful. Some items are not quite what they appear in the picture but these are even better. You will not be disappointed at all. <end>
 B000NZT8QE  XPY 14k Yellow Gold Diamond Frog Pendant (.04 ct) ||	  Well made frog pendant  A gift to my wife who likes frog items. She was impressed and wears in all the time. Well crafted and sturdy and looks good too. <end>  Amazon is the best  I really enjoy shopping at this site. My order did not take long to arrive and I really love the convenience shopping at this site. I love my frog!!!! <end>  Decent 14k yellow gold jewely for $89  The diamonds on the eyes are good, but those on the back are very poor. <end>
 B000NZT8QY  XPY 14k Rose Gold Diamond Cat Pendant (1/5 cttw) ||	  Purr-fect!  I first saw this necklace in Macy's for a lot more money, so I bought it on Amazon. It is absolutely beautiful! If you like it in the picture, you'll love it even more in person! I didn't pay tax or shipping and it arrived very quickly. The only drawback is the chain is so tiny and delicate, it has to be replaced with a thicker rose gold or white gold chain. <end>  Absolutely gorgeous pendant who's chain doesn't do it justice.  When I opened the box, my breath was taken away. It is a magnificent pendant, whose back is even beautiful, however the chain is flimsy. I should have expected it because many of the other reviews say something similar. I only wore it 5 times and when I went to take it off this last time, the clasp broke. Now I have to take it to a jeweler and pay to have it fixed or purchase a new chain. Neither of which I am looking forward to. I don't regret getting it because the pendant is that beautiful. I just wish the chain would have lasted longer than 5 wearings. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because of the chain breaking. Had it not broke, I would have given it 4 stars, and had it come with a better chain then definitely 5 stars. <end>  Pretty Kitty  I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She refused to wear anything but yellow gold until this was in her hand. A very nice design that catches the eye without being gaudy. Good quality for the money, but the diamonds are not the highest clarity, of course. They add a bit of bling to the piece, but don't expect them to sparkle like a larger more expensive diamond would. <end>  14k Rose Gold Diamond Cat Pendant  Like other reviewr's have stated, the chain is very delicate, I would not recommend it for every day wear. As for the pendant, I love the kitty; the size is great and I love the 'sparkle'! <end>  14k Rose Gold Diamond Cat Pendant (1/5 cttw)  The shipping and delivery was good. all was good except to see the price dropped a week after i had made my purchase and its a good thing to keep looking. I am pleased to get a credit on the price drop ,but only had i looked. i wish there were a price guarantee to inform me when something like this does happen. <end>  Great  My wife loves this and I'm happy I didn't let the reviews regarding a small chain bother me. I think the chain is a perfect compliment to the piece. I highly recommend this to cat lovers everywhere! People are constantly complimenting my wife on this beautiful piece! <end>  Cat Pendant  My wife loved the Pendant but the chain will need to be replaced. It was too short and too light weight. Othger than that it would have been a 5. <end>  Nice but not rose-gold hue as expected  As everyone said, the pendant is nice, and cute. Was a great hit with the wife but the chain (even with all the comments) was even thinner than expected. I kept looking at the hue of the rose gold and don't think it has the right "rose gold" hue. Looked more like normal gold not as yellow but still just gold and not as rosy as the picture. That is why I took out 1 star for the chain and the second star for the color. But it is a nice piece. It is buyers be wary as opposed to beware. <end>  Gift for my Girlfriend  My girlfriend is a cat-lover so this seemed like a good choice. The rose-gold chain is VERY thin and can bind up if your not careful but after a bunch of years she still has this in perfect condition and wears it all the time. I'm glad I bought it. <end>  Even the Jewelers like it!  I have had a cat since I was 8 years old now I'm 56, and Bertha, my last one, I had for 18 years died 2 years ago and this is the longest I have not had a cat around me. This past Christmas my wonderful husband descovered Amazon jewelry and got me the Diamond Cat Pendant. I wear it daily, but just notice a diamond is missing! I'm heartbroken. Would have given 5 stars, but now I have to buy a diamond! <end>  Very, very good present!  I got it for myself for my birthday, instead of fancy Tiffany  ) It is amazing. The chain is delicate but I think that what makes it more beautiful. It is not easily breakable just delicately thin. <end>  Nice Necklace  This was a Christmas gift we bought for my sister. I have to say I was pretty impressed with the quality of the pendant. The chain is shorter but pretty nice. Overall for the price you aren't going to find something nicer than this. <end>  Wife Loved it  I bought this for my wife's birthday. We have always had cats (currently have 8, all indoor) so it was appropriate. It's really a nice piece of jewelry, even though I know nothing about jewelry. It's smaller than I thought it would be and the chain is really really delicate; too small if fact for my wife's taste. But she really likes the piece. Hey, that's all that matters to me. I done good. <end>  Beautiful  My cat passed away three months ago and I was and am still heartbroken. He was white with orange stripes and the white diamonds and rose gold whiskers of this beautiful pendant are sweet reminders of my perfect angel boy. The rose gold chain is a gorgeous rose color but too delicate for daily use, so I placed my cat-charm on a sturdier chain that works as well. Whether as a gift or a gift for oneself, one cannot miss with this adorable, sparkling item. <end>  Elegant  I received this piece of jewelry from my boyfriend for Christmas. I absolutely love it and have had many compliments on it already. My only complaint is that the chain is very flimsy. <end>  Amazing Valentine's Day Gift.  My beloved boyfriend picked this up for me for Valentine's Day. I wasn't expecting much since we had only been together for a couple of months and I'd never done anything for Valentine's Day before, and he ended up hiding it in a box of chocolate candy, so I was very surprised and excited to see the first piece of jewelry I've ever received from someone.And it couldn't be a more creative and perfect piece. As a lover of cats and all things cute and fuzzy, I knew when he selected this as a gift for me, it was because he loves me and thinks of me and what I like.The only part I dislike is the chain, which we quickly replaced with a thicker sterling silver chain. It is very, very fine, and the clasp tends to get stuck inside the upper portion of the pendant.I wear this thing every day and all the time (to bed, in the bath, to work, etc.), however, and there is no evidence of tarnishing or wear. Such an elegant little kitty, and one of the best gifts I've ever received! <end>  Dainty pretty kitty  This little kitty has a lot of pizazz! Although it is petite, it really sparkles, and the design is easy to "read" from a distance. The chain is fine, but in scale & reasonably substantial. Perfectly suitable as an everyday "trademark" piece for a cat-loving adult, it would also delight a a younger person. Altogether, a lot of sparkle and smiles for the price! <end>  fabulous gift for a cat lover  THis piece is magnificent. It is a fabulour gift for a true cat lover. Unlike other pieces i looked at that really only should be worn by a child, this piece is sophisticated and elegant with the silouette and the diamonds. Then only draw back is the chain is really too delicate for everyday wear. I gave this as a gift to my manager and she loves it. She wears the piece everyday. <end>  Adorable Diamond Kitty  Love this sparkly kitty!I have never owned any rose gold...until now. The cat is so pretty with the rose gold, diamonds & yellow-gold whiskers.Although it is not a large piece, it shows up very nicely. I did, however, purchase a new rose gold box chain to replace the fine rose gold chain which comes with the pendant. I think the new chain gives the entire pendant a little more pizzazz. All of my cat-loving friends have shown great interest in this fancy feline. <end>  Elegant  This diamond kitty pendant is so pretty! It is dainty but large and sparkly enough to be seen easily! If you have been searching for an everyday necklace and you love kitties, this is FOR SURE the necklace for you! <end>  Beautiful necklace for any cat lover  I bought this as a treat for myself after Christmas, and I was very impressed with the quality of the necklace. It's a classy way to show your love of cats, and the diamond sparkles liven up any outfit. I've received many compliments when I wear it (and I really hate to take it off - it's become my favorite necklace!) I am extremely pleased with this purchase. <end>  Cat Necklace  I was pleasantly surprised by the size and overall appearance of the necklace. Often you find the item is not as nice as what you'd hoped. This exceeded my expectations and I've gotten quite a few compliments. <end>  This kitty is so darling  I received this kitty as a birthday present from my beau and I love it!!!It's not too large, not too small so it can be worn everyday. The only gripe is the chain is flimsy but that is an easy fix. I love my new kittycat  ) <end>  Pendant nice, chain not!  The chain with this pendant is much more flimsier than I even expected from these reviews. To make matters worse, the chain came tied in a huge knot which was very difficult to remove given the very fine gauge of the gold. I was terrified I would break it while detangling.This cute kitty pendant definitely deserves a gold chain about 5 times the weight of the current chain. The circle ring clasp is so flimsy that I can't even open it with nails and put it on. Kitty needs a lobster claw clasp! I realize the price of gold is high, but Amazon should be embarrassed to sell this low quality chain. <end>  Perfect  Perfect in every way. If I had to find a complaint, I'd say the chain is a bit thin. The size is perfect in our opinion. <end>  A feline friend!  It is only fitting that my first piece of diamond jewelry should be a cat. It is a beautiful necklace. The rose colored gold chain and accents are lovely. It is a treasure that I will wear every day. Meow!! <end>  Absolutely adorable!  I bought this for my daughter's 22nd birthday. It is absolutely adorable and well worth the price!! <end>
 B000NZWTY2  Dream, Believe, Achieve Silver & Crystal Expressively Yours Bracelet ||	  Good Quality - Great buy!  Love this bracelet! The bracelet itself is, of course, gorgeous. It's so pretty. The words carved into it match the message in the box. Now it comes in a very cute little box that makes great for gifts. And the best thing is the message - so inspirational and just makes the bracelet even more special. It's a great buy! <end>  Best, Cute, And Prettiest thing EVER  I received it today. It came in a box! It had the bracelet and along with it was a poem! It was adorable! Island and The Sun has great products! <end>  Perfect gift  This bracelet makes a beautiful gift. Comes in a nice box ready to give. The words are inspiring and colors go with almost anything. Will have to buy another one soon. <end>  Pretty!  I bought this as a graduation present for my step daughter who is graduating from 6th grade. I ordered something else as a back up because on the website this did not look very pretty. I was very pleased to find that it arrived in very nice packaging and the bracelet itself is alot nicer than its picture. Don't hesitate to order for that special little girl in your life! <end>  Great Gift  I buy these all the time for Bat Mitzvah/Communion gifts to give with $. It's nice to get a little something special not just cash. It's a very nice message and hard to find something different for different religious gifts not just cross or star of david  ) The box is also very pretty! Recommend! <end>  Perfect graduation gift  Got this for our two sisters who were graduating (one for college, one for highschool) and they are perfect little gifts. It's not "Expensive jewelry" so as mentioned before -- if someone wants something really expensive and suuper nice...not the way to go. But our sisters love jewelry of all sorts so it is perfect. Came in a lovely little gift box which were perfect to give away. Came promptly - total of 5 business days. Completely impressed!  ) <end>  Present for Best Friend  I liked this bracelet because it was very pretty and cheap. My daughter chose this (I bought it) for her best friend, and we just got it today. You can't actually just buy it and then give it to someone, because it has a bag in which the bracelet is kept for packaging. It's nothing big, just a plastic bag. (It specifically says Remove Before Giving or something like that.) The stones feel kinda cheap, so this is a great present for kids! On the back of the card with the saying, there's a To and From place to fill out. 1 small complaint was that when Amazon sent it, the bracelet came in a huge box, and the rest were just air bags. It literally was like 1/6 of the whole box. Overall, this is a really good bracelet! <end>  DREAM BRACELET  I JUST WORE THIS BRACELETE AND I LOVE IT . I ALSO BROUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES IT AS WELL GREAT PRODUCT. YES I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE THANKS A BUNCH. <end>  inspirational graduation charm bracelet  I gave this bracelet to my wife for graduation. She really likes it but one of the charms came loose a few weeks later. At least her wrist hasn't turned green. <end>  Great buy for a teenager  This bracelet was a gift for my niece. I thought it was nice and motivating for someone who going through the start of adulthood. She really liked it and wears it often. <end>  Crystal Bracelet  My duaghter loved this bracelet. Exactly as ordered. Waiting to see how the bracelet holds up over time. Reviews should not have a length requirement. <end>  An Inspirational Gift  I gave it to a co-worker who teaches sixth-graders for a Christmas gift. She loves it, not only for how pretty it is, but also for the message it carries to remind her how to encourage her students to achieve their best every time she wears it. It seems well made, and is a very attractive piece of jewelry. I would highly recommend it to anyone. <end>  bracelet  I bought this for my dauughter for a small graduation gift. It was also her birthstone, so how lucky is that. She loved it, and that;s all that matters to me. <end>  nice Bracelet  This is a gift for my son's girlfriend. She is currently getting her Bachelor's Degree in social work. She gets overwhelmed at times with her studies so I thought this would give her a boost of confidence. <end>  cute  it is cute but it was too big for my wrist. i have to use it as a decorative piece for my car. <end>  lovely  i got this for my niece for her birthday and she loved it  ) the color is just like in the picture <end>  This is a very nice bracelet.  I got this for a friend's graduation. For that price, I thought it might be a little bit tacky but I actually really like it. The bracelet has a pleasant, heavy sort of feel like it's made out of nice materials. The details look really good up close--I especially like the sort of woven metal look of the little heart charm. To top it all off this bracelet comes in a cute little box with a bow, a silk lining and a thoughtful card inside with a to and from label. For less then 9$ I think it's a great buy! <end>  Beautiful!!  This is a bracelet I wear most of the time...it is pretty enough to dress down and dress up. It came packaged in a very nice gift box. <end>  Pretty little bracelet  This pretty little bracelet was the perfect inspirational gift for my daughter. We have Dream, Believe, Achieve posted near our homework station, so the bracelet made a perfect "take along" compliment to our moto. <end>  Nice friendship bracelets  First of all, i need to say thanks for the fast delivery. Bracelet is very nice, and the case is very cute. I very much recommend this product for any ocasion, Friendship-Christmas-or just "I thought about you today". <end>  Sigh  This was a perfect gift to give in so many ways, expressed what I wanted to say. Good gift for friend or family. <end>  The teachers loved it  We gave this bracelet to my kids' teachers and they loved it. I saw the principal of our school and a few other teachers admiring it. The bracelet is sturdy and well constructed and to top it off its really pretty. <end>  Lovely Bracelet!  The bracelet was exactly as shown in the picture. It comes in a lovely box with a card that has a poem written on it. My friends loved the bracelets and I am very pleased with the purchase! <end>  Clearly Charming, Indeed!  ALL of these charm bracelets (and I've ordered most of them for friends, family and (I couldn't resist!) myself) are surprisingly lovely. Each comes in a silk-lined be-ribboned box with a little inspirational poem that matches the inspirational words engraved on the silver beads of the bracelet. A lovely keepsake and beautiful way to express your feelings and hopes for those you love. <end>  A Darling Gift  I bought this for my niece for part of her graduation gift. It comes in a darling little gold box with a bow and it is as cute as can be. <end>  Great Gift  I gave this gift to my little cousin as a middle school graduation gift and she loved it. Everything from the bracelet, to the card...even the box, was perfect. I will definitely try to use this seller again if I need another gift like this. <end>  It turned colors about three days after i brought it  (  I really liked it when i first got it and the box it came in was awesome!!But it turned colors after the first three days... it looks horrible now  (Im really sad because i REALLLYY liked it and planned to wear it for a lonnnng time  / <end>  Part broken  I was very disappointed with this product since i bought it for one of my students as a graduation gift.....the heart was broken  ( <end>  Great gift for young girls  Very pretty. Keep in mind this is "costume" jewelry, not high quality gems and solid metals. That means if the person you buy it for only wears real gems, 14K+ gold, and 999 silver, they might not appreciate it. But if the person who it is bought for does wear costume jewelry, it is high quality for costume jewelry and they will be pleased. Presentation box is very nice.Bottom line; I think this is a great gift for young girls or a nice gift for a youngster to give to an adult (price is low for the quality you get). Great gift for the price, one of the best pieces of costume jewelry I've purchased. <end>  Cute little bracelet  I got three of these for Christmas last year, well, not all three this exact model but of this same brand. All three of them have withstood the test of time so far, and only one of the people I gave it too had a problem with it (but it was because she has super thin wrists and it kept slipping off). While they're not made of high style materials they are a good deal for what they cost and seem fairly durable. <end>  Pretty bracelet  I bought this bracelet for my son's elementary school teacher. She loved it! The box and gift card were very nice as well. The length seemed a bit on the small side, however. <end>  Bracelet  Bought for co-worker...she loved it! Beads weren't too big like on some chunky bracelets...more feminine...arrived on time in a cute box <end>  just  brought it for a birthday and it fit her perfectly she loved it wow it may her happy.thanks a lot <end>  bad quality  Bought two bracelets from and they were beautiful. As soon as my d as daughter opened it and put on it broke! <end>  Pretty  This is a great gift for yourself or someone you may want to pass some inspiration to. The only thing is the way it clasps doesn't always stay hooked. But it's cute <end>  Birthday present charm!  Bought this for a girl's birthday party gift. It is beautiful, delicate, and charming. Perfect for a tween who likes jewelry. The package was very stylish! <end>  A wonderful gift for the price!  I was completely surprised by how nice this bracelet, and the presentation box with ribbon and poem, were when it arrived! I've been careful not to get it wet and don't wear it on a daily basis but, for the price, it is a lovely inspirational item of costume jewelry and I receive comments every time I wear it.I'm back to purchase several more for a team of coworkers I'm leading on a very important, very stressful project. I also purchased the &#34;teacher&#34; version of this bracelet for my son's teachers for the upcoming Valentine's Day.You simply can't go wrong with this one - just understand that it's not going to last a lifetime and use care. If I was really worried about discoloration, I'd &#34;paint&#34; the silver-tone beads with clear nail polish. <end>  Great Gifts!  I will be ordering these bracelet's over and over again. They areso nice. They come in the perfect little gift box! Please keep themcoming in more choices. Thank you. <end>
 B000NZX61C  XPY 14k Yellow Gold Amethyst and Diamond-Accent Fleur-de-Lis Pendant, 18" ||	  Throw away the chain  The pendant is very pretty and a nice size although the amethysts are very pale in color. The chain is worthless. It is thinner than dental floss and will break the first time it gets caught in anything. The clasp is very cheap and opens unevenly making it difficult to close. If you buy this, plan on purchasing a more substantial chain to wear it on. <end>  Fleur-De-Lis Pendant  This was given to me as a gift. I absolutely LOVE it! I have gotten so many compliments on it! It is a wonderful quality & quite stunning!! <end>  buyer  Very satisfied with the pendent but the chain broke within a week. Plan on replacing the chain since it is very fragile and thin. Other than that, I am pleased with the product. <end>
 B000NZY800  XPY 14k Two-Tone Gold Moon and Star Diamond Pendant (.03 cttw, J Color, I2 Clarity) ||	  Muslim-American  I love my new pendant. It is very beautiful and lovely. It does not scream religious jewelry but it does represent religious value to me. I can wear this everyday without anyone thinking anything of it. Well made and dainty! <end>  I loved it  I just got this one as a gift from my parents!It is very delicate and gorgeous. Do not expect a big pendant like is shown on the picture. Although, I think the size is actually pretty good, not too big and not too small. <end>  Gift to Me  It is delicate and gorgeous. I wanted it because it reminds me of the Sailor Moon Stick with the Silver Imperial Crystal attached. My boyfriend got it for me for my birthday.It's small, only about the size of my thumbnail. The chain itself is not very long, and I plan to replace it with a longer one. I'm a bit worried that I'll break it because of how delicate it appears. This has yet to be an issue, though.For about $120, if you have specific reasons you'd want this design, it's definitely worth it. I wouldn't recommend it for just a casual piece of jewelry to give to someone, because you could find a more well-sculpted bit in a store for a better price. I, personally, adore it. <end>  Beautiful Necklace  The moon is very special to me for personal reasons, so I was thrilled to receive this as a gift.As other reviewers have mentioned, do not order this expecting a huge piece. It is small, dainty, and feminine. I do not like long necklaces, so the length of this delicate chain is perfect for me.What I did not like was that unlike the picture shown above, it didn't come to me nicely tucked in a cardboard insert. It was down inside a blue velet bag, which is an nice touch. But the bad part was that the entire chain was a solid knot that *literally* took me over 3 hours to untangle. The chain is so slender I was afraid of being anything but gentle with it.In the end, that was not enough for me to knock a star off this absolutely lovely necklace. <end>  Star Diamond Pendant  14k Two-Tone Gold Moon and Star Diamond Pendant (.03 cttw, J Color, I2 Clarity)This Pendant was everything I wished it to be. <end>
 B000O1JE98  10k Yellow Gold Diamond Cupcake Pendant (.05 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), 18" ||	  Better than Expected  Beautiful cupcake! I got this as a christmas gift from my boyfriend. The combination of the necklace and mathing box makes a touching personal gift. The box is fantastic, and both the box and the pendant were a lot larger than I expected from reading reviews and looking at the photos. Overall I am very happy with the necklace.However  The chain is very thin, I am in the process of finding a new one because I am afraid I am going to break it and the clasp is tiny and hard to fasten. Would not reccomend for someone with arthritius. <end>  Too Sweet!  Purchased for my son to give to his girlfriend, he calls her "Cupcake". For an inexpensive necklace you can't go wrong with this one, IMO. The necklace I received was filled with sparkle, no tangled chain....AND.....the cupcake box is too cute, charming and oh, so sweet!I purchased several jewelry items in lightning round deals, and this by far was my best purchase, certainly exceeded my expectations! Even though the chain is thin as others have mentioned, most of these under $100 necklaces are going to have a more delicate chain. <end>  Review of 10K Yellow Gold Diamond Cupcake Pendant  I recently purchased the 10K yellow gold diamond cupcake pendant. The pendant is beautiful, but smaller than I would prefer. I liked it so much, however, that I kept it anyway and will put it on a smaller chain or on a charm holder. <end>  Cute, dainty....  It arrived fast. The packaging was adorable. I ordered it because its unique. Its not something you see often, if ever. However the chain....Its very delicate. I have difficulty putting it on and taking it off by myself. I will be buying another chain. Although, I have received a lot of complements on the pendant. I'm satisfied. <end>  Great!  I gave this as a gift. The box was adorable and the necklace was just what I was looking for. <end>  Fantastic  10k Yellow Gold Diamond Cupcake Pendant w/ Cupcake Box (.05 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), 18"I purchased this for my girlfriends birthday and when i received it i wanted to keep it for myself its so petite and oh i cant say its just beautiful and since giving it to her the comments she has received are fantastic....Very Impressed with what i received...Thanks Amazon i will be back to purchase again..... <end>  Box trouble, but still good  First off, there isn't a problem with the pendant. Sure it is sort of small (about the size of a nickel) but it is still simply stunning. I got it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it.I was a bit worried about the quality of the chain though. It seemed too light and flimsy to hold together, but to my surprise it is quite tough! Buy a new chain if you really desire so, but the one it comes with is just fine.The box it comes in is my only complaint. Sure it looks beautiful, but it is poorly constructed. I got it out of the shipping box and opened it and SNAP! The lid came off. Upon closer inspection, the company hardly used any glue to fasten it down to the lid. THIS MEANS that if anyone, no matter a child or adult, could accidentally separate the lid as well. And while it is fixable, it just doesn't look the same or might not hold well at all  (Besides the letdown, I am a very happy with the product  D(and if the company is reading this, I could gladly use a new box ;] ) <end>  10K Yellow Gold Diamond Cupcake Pendant  This was bought to give as a Christmas present to our 13 year old granddaughetr that we raise and she is our cupcake.SHE LOVES IT! Will be treasured by her forever and nobody else at her school got one for Christmas - so that made it extra special.Very nice for the money. <end>  Nice, but...  Nice package it came in but the tiny chain that the pendant came with broke on the second time it was used. If you purchase this - be prepared to buy another chain because this one will not do the job. <end>  Lovely gift for all occasions  I bought this necklace for my sister-in-law for Christmas. I really liked it not only because of its unusual design, but because it came in a cute porcelain cupcake-shaped box. She loved it. The price is nice for a gold necklace.Granted, the chain is very thin, but that seems to be the norm these days, even on necklaces costing five times this much. I have just reconciled myself to the fact that I will send a better, stronger chain on the next gift-giving occasion. <end>  Gorgeous, but a few things...  This pendant is adorable and quirky and sparkly. HOWEVER, the chain it came on? Hopelessly tangled and I had to cut it with scissors to get the pendant off. Since I planned on wearing it on my own chain, no biggie, but...still. Also, the picture led me to think this was...well, a 3-dimensional cupcake. It's kind of puffed out, but not what it looks like in the pic. Am I the only one who thought this?? <end>  Cupcake only  The cupcake was gorgeous but the chain was so thin it arrived all tangled I wound up tossing it and using another gold chain. I loved the cupcake itself. It was worth the money even without the chain. <end>  ADORABLE!  WAY cuter and far more delicate in real life. It doesn't look as kitschy or cutesy. It's way more feminine and dainty. HIGHLY recommend. I wouldn't recommend for a younger child though -- the chain is very thin. Not cheap, just thin. <end>  A sweet treat!  My husband ordered this for our kids to give me as a gift, since who doesn't love a good cupcake? And at 0 calories, this is my kind of treat!The pendant is about the size of a dime, but the diamond 'frosting' supplies a surprisingly good amount of sparkle. The chain is dainty, but suspends the cupcake nicely, and doesn't feel flimsy.I also love the cupcake gift box, its a really adorable touch to an already adorable necklace.Worth the price? Yes!Also, my chain is stamped with 14k and the cupcake is stamped with 10k. <end>  Cute, but arrive tangled....  I was so excited to finally receive my cupcake necklace! The packaging was well themed, as it came in an adorable cupcake ceramic box. The necklace pictured on the site is a great representation of the actual necklace and the cupcake is small and cute. The necklace is delicate but it matches well with the cupcake. The only major problem was that the chain arrived completely tangled, as others had stated. However, I was so anxious to wear it, I sat and untangled it, which took me about 25 minutes. <end>  Did We Receive the Same Pendant???  With such glowing reviews, I really expected this to be a nice necklace. The diamonds are dull; you can barely see them and the chain will have to be replaced. This was not super expensive, but for $100 - I definitely expected more than this necklace. So far, I've been ashamed to even give this as a gift! <end>  SUPER SWEET LOVE IT!  THE DIAMONDS ARE MICROSCOPIC BUT THEY ARE SUPER SPARKLY AND FOR 50.00 YOU CAN BEAT THIS ITEM! THE CHAIN IS SUPER DELICATE, AND I WILL PROBABLY USE MY OWN- BUT IT'S A GOOD BACK UP! THE 10K GOLD LOOKS GOOD AND THE SIZE IS SMALL BUT YOU CAN STILL MAKE OUT THAT IT'S A CUPCAKE!! IT CAME IN A CUTE LITTLE CUPCAKE BOX! I LOVE WHEN THINGS SHIP FREE AND ON TIME! YIPEE!!!! <end>  Trendy and Cheap  I was very excited to come across this item while browsing Amazon. I saw a similar cupcake necklace in InStyle magazine several months ago that I was dying to have. Unfortunately it retailed $525. I couldn't find anything nearly as cute as that one until I saw this, and at $50 and free shipping, I couldn't pass it up.Unlike other reviewers, my necklace came in perfect condition. The chain was not at all tangled, though it is delicate. The diamonds are small, but very sparkly. I expected the necklace to come in the cupcake box, as pictured, but it did not. It arrived in a velvet pouch inside another small box. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. I think this would make a wonderful gift. <end>  Just Beautiful !!!!  The cupcake pendant is absoutly gorgeous. You cannot go wrong with the price. Yes, the chain is a little thin, but the sparkle of pendant is just so much to resist. I saw something similar online for about $300.00 so this fits my budget perfectly. <end>  Cute  This is so cute.My daughter will love it.Not too small and with just enough sparkle. I would have liked it to be a little larger but for the price what can you expect. Certainly, the chain is too thin, but pendant is cute regardless. <end>  Diamonds and Gold  I purchased three of these beautiful pendent's with gold chains. They are beyond what I expected. My Grand daughters love them. This is a gift they will enjoy for years to come. <end>  Cupcake Pendate review  Product as described and everything was fine...was a very nice and appreciated gift by the recipiant. <end>  who doesn't love cupcakes?  I love the little box it comes in and the pendant itself is adorable. Same complaint I have seen here is mine as well. The chain is hopelessly thin but most of these little diamond fashion pendants come with this kind of chain. No big deal I can swap it easily. I did expect it to be a little puffier 3D-ish than it is. It is flat for the most part. But for the $$ I spent on it, it's also not a big deal. I love it. <end>  Diamond Cupcake  My girl just loved the necklace, she wears it all the time and receives a lot of compliments. The cupcake box is a real cool package. Kudos! <end>  delightful cupcake  You can tell by some of the reviews that some people have had trouble with the chain. I continue to wear the original chain and cupcake pendant with no problems what so ever, I never take it off. The cupcake is very sparkly and I have gotten tons of compliments. I LOVE IT!! <end>  so disappointed  I was so excited to see my package on the front porch but my excitement turned to dismay. Mine came with the chain tangled in a knot so tight that I couldn't begin to fix it. I know that I can return and have it replaced...but what a disappointment. <end>  I hate it  The item is much smaller than I expected. Please tell me how to return it. <end>  Dainty!  Precious little piece. Diamond quality not exactly the best but they are small so still sparkle aplenty. I bought this awhile back so price was very reasonable then...when gold prices weren't so high. <end>  Gorgeous  Ordered this for my best friend as a birthday gift. It was even more beautiful in person. It is petite and cute but with plenty of sparkle. She loves it and wears it all the time. <end>  cupcakes for life  My daughter has been taking cupcakes for her birthday parties for 29 years so on her 30th we decided to get a special one for her. She loves the necklace and so do we. <end>  great little necklace  My niece loved it,she couldn't wait to put it on,now she does take it off. Great item for a great price.. <end>  Diamond Cupcake Necklace  There is always a tremendous mark-up in jewelry but this necklace represented a good value. It's well executed and my lady friend loved it. The chain was perhaps a bit too delicate for the pendant.10k Yellow Gold Diamond Cupcake Pendant w/ Cupcake Box (.05 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), 18" <end>  I hope my sister likes this for christmas. I do wish the diamonds were bigger, but the price was great.  It WAS a bit smaller than I had anticipated, but I feel like it was a good value nonetheless. Shipping was FAST and the package was in good order. The case was really cute and I think my sis will really like what I got her this year. Thanks. <end>  really cute  This necklace is exactly as I expected...not too big, not too small. The quality seems very good to me, and I'm very happy with it. <end>  SHE LOVES IT!  I recently bought this necklace for my girlfriend on her birthday. She opened her gift and absolutely loves it! She said it was cute and very sparkly. The shipping was very fast so over all I'm very pleased with my purchase. Thanks Amazon. <end>  looks nice, delivered in time, cool box  superior in every wy to anything you could order from pugster. stay away from pugster, kids. <end>  cupcake pendant  It was nice. It came in a ceramic cupcake but the hinge was broken and it was poorly crafted but I was buying the pendant <end>  not so sweet little cupcake!  I was very dissappointed in this piece. I thought that it was three dimensional but it is flat and very tiny. It is very cheap looking. It is a piece for a much younger child, not my grown daughter. <end>  Madddddddddddddd  This was marked as a gift. They took a delicate chain and tied it in knots and wrapped scotch tape around it. Pretty PITIFUL.Totally disrespectful of my purchase. The chain could not withstand the struggle to be free of the scotch tape. What were they thinking???? Crap. I could not give that to my granddaughter, I love her too much. Then they make me give it a star. <end>  just what I wanted  I had been eyeing this necklace for months. I adore jewelry and my husband has been kind enough to indulge my addiction for many years. I had read the reviews that many people were disappointed with the quality of the chain, but I was specifically looking for an "every day necklace" with a subtle chain, and this fit the bill beautifully. I also have to say that I was fortunate, because my cupcake box arrived in perfect condition, and my chain was not tangled in any way. As for the box, lots of people went on about whether it was or was not cute, and I thought, 'who cares, I'm here for the necklace', but I have to tell you that the box does have an adorable charm to it. It's surprisingly really cute. As for the pendant, it is the size of a dime, which was actually bigger than I was expecting, but does show off the detail nicely. The 'icing' part is actually less triangular than I was expecting from the picture. It isn't quite as rounded as other cupcake charms that I have seen, but I was a little surprised at it's shape because I felt that the triangular shape in the pictures made it more cupcake looking and less muffin... The sparkle is lovely, and I am really happy with this gift. I truly believe that it is the best looking cupcake pendant out there. <end>  A little disapointed  When I saw the picture i thought the pendant was much bigger and thicker. I actually thought it was a 3-dimensional cupcake and it isn't. It's almost flat.The chain is very thin also. I am giving this to my daughter for her 6th birthday and definetly will replace the chain.Oh, I absolutely loved the cupcake box that the necklace came on. <end>  Yellow cup cake pendant is minuscule  The cupcake container was very cute and cupcake size but the jewelry inside was minuscule so that was rather disappointing. I gave away to a young girl because it would not impress any adult ladies. <end>  Very pleased with my gift!  I had put this item on my wish list of Christmas gifts, thinking it was very cute, but that I probably wouldn't receive it. Lo and behold, come Christmas there was my necklace. It isn't exactly as I pictured, it's very delicate. I think I actually like it better though because it doesn't look too kitchsy. I can actually wear this with something other than casual attire. I love it and would definitely recommend purchasing if you're are or know a cupcake gal like me! <end>  Crazy chain  The pendant is worth the money, it looks good. But like everyone else has said...the chain comes in a tangled mess. I had to trash it. <end>  Lot SMALLER than expected  I ordered this for a Christmas gift. When I received it the glass Cupcake container it comes in was broken. The lid was stuck and was cracked all around. After finally getting it opened I was shocked. I understand they show things LARGER than they are BUT this was SMALL,SMALL,SMALL..... I returned it with no problems..... If the cupcake on the necklace would have been larger I would have just exchanged it but was not in my opinion worth the money. I would recommend this only to someone who would be buying for a small child that way the cupcake looks LARGER. <end>  Yummy  The cupcake was cute. The chain was very thin. This pendant is more for a child than an adult. It would be better if you gave the size of the chain in the description . <end>  Awesome purchase!  My girlfriend loved this necklace. Came extremely fast and with no problems, errors or rip-offs. Would recommend this to anyone trying to get the cutest gift for their partner! <end>
 B000O1L9LY  10k Yellow Gold Diamond 3-Stone Earrings (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  Insult of the century earrings  After finally locating these earrings in their little blue pouch, I felt like I had been played for a fool. Some things should not even be sold unless an absolutely full disclosure is made in describing them, without using typical marketing euphemisms such as "dainty". These earrings resembled tiny flecks of aluminum foil. I really felt hurt and insulted that anyone would claim that their value was so high and that the reduced price was a mere $119.99. And when you hear the word "diamond" and pay over $100.00 for a pair of earrings, don't you think you should at least have them arrive in a pretty velvet box? Regardless of the product desciption of the packaging, I know I deserve better for my money, and the tiny pouch only added insult to injury. Please don't buy these, unless you are prepared to be very disappointed. <end>  Very satisfied  These earrings were meant as a small stocking stuffer for my wife at Christmas. She was surprised and very pleased when she opened them and has been wearing them ever since. When she is happy, I am happy. Many thanks for making these available and getting them shipped out to me in a timely manner! <end>
 B000O1QM2K  10k Yellow Gold Diamond "Mom" Ring (1/10 cttw), Size 7 ||	  2 Thumbs Up!  Bought it for my sis (who became mom), she liked it a lot. <end>
 B000O21KCQ  10k Yellow Gold Aquamarine Bracelet, 7" ||	  Much too light in color  Lovely bracelet if you like a clear look with a hint of color. The picture presented is clearly showing a light color of aquamarie. The bracelet received looks clear. <end>  AQUA GOLD BRACELET  Bracelet arrived on Valentine's Day. "Awesome" Would like another.Clarity clear. Received compliments at dinner the same night. <end>  Didn't like this  For my taste too small and pale looking for 130 dollars, three stars because is not that expensive. <end>  Very pretty bracelet for the money  I bought 3 of these bracelets to wear at the same time as I like a bolder look. The bracelet is light-weight and the stones are quite pale but you can definitely see the blue and the stones sparkle beautifully. Pretty good for the money! <end>
 B000O25IAG  10k Yellow Gold Multi Color Gemstone Bracelet, 7" ||	  Beautiful!!  I love this bracelet! It matches everything. I have had to replace one of the stones, and also repair the clasp, but its worth it because this bracelet is so beautiful. My jeweler loved it too, said she tried to order the links and they are really expensive individually.. <end>
 B000O3B1UQ  Axis 410 Ring and Earring Jewelry Organizer ||	  Great Organizer  I bought two for jewelry drawers I have in my closet. They have worked fantastic for organizing all those pesky earrings, necklaces and bracelets. <end>

 B000O3KH6A  Luxurious 11.00 carats total weight Round Shape Garnet & White CZ Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Nice but a little gaudy for me  I love the style of the necklace but my only complaint is that the CZ's are too big and it is obvious that they are fake. Sort of gives it an obvious costume jewelry look. I have other necklaces by Peora that I love. The Garnet necklace from Peora without the CZ's is one of my favorites and I would recommend that one. <end>
 B000O3KHG0  Flower Design Round Shape Created Sapphire & White CZ Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Beautiful but delicate  The necklace is beautiful, as good if not better than the picture. The sapphires are a dark rich blue. It certainly had the WOW factor when I gave it to my girl friend for her birthday.The chain seemed a bit fragile, so be careful what you wear it with so it doesn't get caught. The adjustable links add/remove about 1.5 inches, which is a nice feature. Note that this is not a pendant, so the chain can't be changed. The flowers are part of the chain.Unfortunately, I didn't realize the chain contains nickel, which my girl friend is allergic to. I had read somewhere (I had carefully researched before purchasing) that Sterling Silver was 92.5% silver, the rest being copper to make it stronger. According to Peora, the other 7.5% does contain some nickel. After wearing the necklace a day, my girl friend had a rash around her neck. I wanted to return the necklace, but Peora's policy is that they don't take back items that have been worn.So I'm left with a necklace that I will have to regift to someone who isn't allergic to nickel. <end>
 B000O3KHNI  Marvellous 5.75 carats total weight Marquise Shape Peridot Multi-Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  pretty nice  I bought this necklace for my girlfriend and she loved it. The only thing I didn't like that the clasp was a little weird. Other then that it is a nice necklace. <end>  Simularities  "One of the many simularities between goldfish and women is that they like anything that sparkles." Just kidding, but it was a nice necklace, though I am not sure where it is today since the lady I gave it too is no longer in the picture, not that I think the necklace had anything to do with the seperation, but... you never know. Overall a nice necklace. <end>
 B000O3KHOW  Marvellous 6.50 carats total weight Marquise Shape London Blue Topaz Multi-Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Pretty good  I suppose I am not very good at visualizing how a piece of jewelry will look from online versus in hand. This was smaller than I expected it to be, but that is probably more due to my perception based on the picture than anything else. When I got it in, I was still pleased with it. The person I gave it to also really liked it, so it worked out well. The blue is beautiful, and the silver is a nice complement to it. <end>
 B000O3KI14  Unique Pear Shape Created Sapphire & White CZ Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  disappointed  I am returning this necklace. The silver is so bright that it looks fake, and the CZ settings are klunky, not delicate the way it appeared in the photo. <end>  Beautiful Necklace, Great Price  I purchased this necklace for a wedding and was very happy with the price. The stones were a little larger than I thought, but I was perfectly fine with that. All the stones had great clarity and the color of the sapphire was amazing. The settings were just the right size for the size of the stones and the chain felt very secure. I was so pleased with this purchase that I also bought other sapphire necklaces for my bridesmaids from this same seller. <end>
 B000O3M2JK  Trendy 3.50 carats total weight Oval & Round Shape London Blue Topaz Multi-Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Surpassed expectations  It was a mother's Day present for my wife. Very striking piece. We are both very pleased with the size, color, and quality. Highly recommended! <end>
 B000O3M2VI  Eye catchy 1.50 carats total weight Pear Shape Swiss Blue Topaz & White CZ Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Gift for my girlfriend  She loved it! She's not hard to please, but she definitely wears it a lot, and I think it looks great on her. She's gotten some 3rd party compliments as well. I think it's a really nice size and just generally quite attractive. <end>
 B000O3M3SA  Elegant 1.50 carats total weight Trillion Cut Swiss Blue Topaz & White CZ Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  elegant and lovely  Just like the title, just that i wish i could move the main part because the necklace can look crocked easily if its not hooked in the right hole...but great investment and very lovely box <end>  very nice necklace  Read two good reviews on this necklace before deciding to order it. The necklace came beautifully packaged and was just as pictured. Very good choice as a gift. <end>  An eye-catching piece of jewelry  I am a very hard person to buy jewelry for, but even my pickiness couldn't mar my opinion when I got this necklace as a gift. It is very light and can be fairly casual or formal depending on your needs, and the adjustable length makes it easier to tailor to your desired neckline. My only problem, as is also described by the other reviewer, is that it is easy for the necklace to migrate a little to one side without you noticing, and because it is not a pendant sliding on a chain, it can't right itself. The adjustable chain also means there is no definitive way to straighten it by touch so you need a mirror. Other than that, though, it's an awesome piece of jewelry and simply very pretty. <end>
 B000O3NEQ0  Luxurious 4.00 carats Marquise & Round Shape Swiss Blue Topaz Multi-Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  It's sparkling  The topaz is surprising well cut & sparkling with nice colour. Even the silver chain is well polished. Simple design, yet elegant. It's worth the price. I've since purchased other items from the seller, awaiting delivery. Hope they're equally good. <end>  Fabulous!  This necklace looks great on. If you love deep, rich, color saturated, swiss blue topaz, get this necklace. You'll be so pleased. The blue topaz is so vibrant and clear. Imagine, sitting on the beach in the Bahamas and gazing at the water. This necklace is exactly the same color blue. When I wore it, I got tons of compliments. It looks fabulous on. The design is different and unique. Thanks, Peora. <end>
 B000O3NEXS  Elegant 3.75 carats total weight Round Shape Garnet Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Garnet Necklace  This is such an elegant beautiful necklace. It shines like it has diamonds in it. I was very pleased when I got it. <end>
 B000O3O56I  NFL Pittsburgh Steelers Rubber Cord Logo Necklace ||	  Steelers rubber cord mis-shaped and pulls hair...  I just got this today and tried it on. I found that for some reason there are springs in the back near the latch. These pull and remove your hair, especially if your hair goes past your neck. The other issue I found is that the rubber cord doesn't lay flat on your chest due to being packaged. I am hoping that hanging it up for a while will straighten the cord. It isnt't worth returning. The only good thing is the pendant seems nice ant the coloring is good. <end>  Pendant is great, but not the rubber cord necklace  The Steeler pendant is perfect! Good size & looks great. But I don't care for the rubber cord necklace. It will not lay straight like a necklace should. Looks too wavy. <end>
 B000O3P4F4  Trendy 4.50 carats total weight Oval & Round Shape Amethyst Multi-Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  beautiful necklace  I bought this necklace for my wedding and was not disappointed. The gems are a rich purple and the weight of the chain is substantial without being too heavy. Very nice necklace. <end>
 B000O3P4XQ  Eye catchy 1.25 carats total weight Pear Shape Peridot & White CZ Gemstone Necklace in Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish ||	  Classy, but silver tarnishes  First, let me say, this is a classy-looking necklace! But the peridot is a lot less intensely green than the picture makes it look unless it's against the right color background. It also won't hang quite like the picture shows--I swear that the angle of the part that the zirconium is mounted on is less steep, and you're also definitely going to get a really obvious bend where the chain meets that part.More importantly, though, I hadn't even worn the necklace for more than a few minutes (to try it on when it arrived), but a few months later when I took it out of the box again the chain was tarnished in several places. It was very disappointing because I expected better quality for something that cost this much. I'm a college student = not a lot of spending money, so it was really hard for me to justify splurging like this (but I have a huge weakness for pretty jewelry, so I did it just this once). Unfortunately, the tarnishing means I probably won't do so again, or at least I will be very hesitant about buying from from Peora the next time I find myself in possession of extra cash. <end>
 B000O3RL9Q  NCAA Ohio State Buckeyes Dangle Earrings ||	  Cute!  These were a birthday gift to my mother in law.....she is an Ohio state fanatic and she loves these!! great quality, they don't look cheap and they are very nice looking on her. Shipping was fast also! <end>  Ohio state earrings  My secret Santa aboslotely loved tis. She is the ultimate fan and is a girly girl. Another girl at work want sone too now. It was cute, well made and came well packaged. She loved it and it was my pleasure to watch her enjoy this so much. <end>  Classic  This is a great pair of classic Ohio State University earrings...a pure staple to a female (or male) Ohio State fan's jewelry wardrobe! <end>  Great for the Buckeye Fan  Both my mother in law and my father in law went to Ohio state. Down here in Florida there aren't as many Ohio products around. She not only loved these, they were reasonably priced compared to other places that I've found them online. The colors were true to the photo and the hooks were of fairly decent quality. <end>  Go Bucks  I purchased 4 sets of these earrings. Will keep one pair for myself, and have already given 2 pair away. If you like Ohio State sports, you gotta love these. They are nicely made, right size, and perfect for Ohio State fans. <end>
 B000O5JA2U  Sterling Silver Amethyst Princess Cut Pendant & Earrings Set ||	  Nice - but could be better.  The set is quite pretty and very well made; but I am unable to give it 5 stars because the only claim it has to being a set is the stone cut and setting similarity. Ie  the pendant stone color is the lovely dark amethyst purple shown in the picture, and the earrings are so much lighter in color that, if not for the same cut of the stone and settings, they wouldn't even look like a set at all. For the $19.99 price I got them at as a Gold Box deal, I guess I shouldn't complain; but the difference between the pendant stone and earring stones is VERY noticeable. Bottom line; I'm quite happy with the pendant - but not with the earrings; which I should also remark on as having some of the longest posts I have ever seen. <end>  Beautiful Gift  I ordered two of these sets for Mother's Day gifts for my mom and mother- in-law. They are quite beautiful and seem to be very well made. I am sure they will be a big hit. <end>  Good jewelry  I was very please with this earring and necklace set. No tarnishing. Good quality amethyst. And I make jewelry myself. Couldn't beat the price. <end>  Beautiful set  This is really a nice set for the price. The amethyst is a deep purple and my girlfriend loved them. I suggest getting a new chain. The one it came with turned green within a few weeks. <end>  Nice  It's a great item beautiful and not so expensive nice gift for any woman <end>  A little small  These were a little smaller then I had expected, but for the cost I would not complain. <end>  Beautiful  This set is really beautiful. I have gotten many complements about them. I got them at a very good value. <end>  amethyst necklace set  it is so beautiful that no one would suspect how little i paid for it.my daughter(the receipient)thought it was wonderful and she scolded me thinking i paid too much for it.Ha!ha! <end>  Very Nice  Bought this as a Christmas gift for this upcoming year... I shop all year long. They were a little smaller than I expected, but not bad. They are really pretty. <end>  Haven't received this yet  I'd like to know where this is. I haven't received it yet. It's been a month. <end>
 B000O5JA48  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Princess Cut Pendant & Earrings Set ||	  Beautiful  I bought this for $19.99 as a Gold Box special because of the price. The picture above looks very washed out and does not do it justice. I just received it today and it is absolutely stunning, not washed out like the picture above. I came back here to see what the price was, to perhaps buy more to give for Christmas gifts. At $29.99 it would be worth buying again for myself if I didn't already have it, but since Xmas is so far off I will wait for something similar in the Gold Box and buy 10 of them. The blue is gorgeous. I wish I had gotten it in the purple color as well. <end>  Great - Wife loved them.  A very nice product. Wife loved them. They are a light blue color and not too vivid but a nice and subtle blue. <end>  Great deal, the blue topas color is lighter than expected  I got this as the gold box deal and price is very attractive. I've always been a fan of blue gem stones and this set offers a nice combination of the topaz with the silver. The downside is the blue color was lighter than I expected, the blue color is a bit too transparent for me. But with the price I paid, I am happy with the purchase. <end>  Dazzling!  Excellent clarity and sparkle! This is a lovely set that I enjoy wearing. The cut of the stones and the setting set off suits and more formal attire beautifully. Definitely a bargain! <end>  Mother's Day Gift  I bought these for my mother on Mother's Day and she loved them. They are very pretty and a decent size for the price. Just don't put the chain in jewelry cleaner!! She did and it turned a weird color but the pendent and the earrings were fine. All in all, for the price, I think it was an excellent purchase. I wish I had bought a set for myself. <end>  Great Gift  Great gift for friend. Nice made.However, sterling silver might get dark in the future. <end>  A little small  These were a little smaller then I had expected, but for the cost I would not complain. <end>
 B000O5TR4G  Smart Money Clip ||	  A Nice Metal Alternative That Won't Rip Your Pockets  I like the product. I find it to be comfortable to keep in my front pocket. It keeps the 5 cards that a carry with me held tight. If you want to get at the card on the bottom of your small stack just remember that you are thumbing through all of them. I holds your bills very securely also. I'm pretty satisfied.The only gripe that I have is that the metal doesn't look at all like what I would expect gunmetal to look like. The picture is deceptive. I thought that I had been sent the wrong item. It looks like a not-so-bright chrome, which almost had me returning it since it cost double the amount of the regular stainless steel. My wife was the one that convince me that it wasn't stainless steel. It just doesn't look like "gunmetal" to me.Other than that, GREAT PRODUCT! <end>  Just what he needed  This is a great combination. It has a place to put a thick pile of credit cards without breaking a standard money clip, and then the cash goes in the clip part. My boyfriend doesn't carry a wallet, so this was ideal for him. <end>  Great concept  I never liked bulky wallets and used to keep my money and cards loose in my pocket. I didn't want a normal money clip because it didn't solve the loose cards issue. Then I finally bought this product. I was very happy with it and frequently commented that it was one of the simplest but best inventions I've used in a while. I have it holding 3 cards, 1 drivers license and 3 thin MTA metro cards - which seems to be the limit of the card side. The money-clip side can easily hold a big wad of cash.Despite the seemingly good quality, after only a year of use the money clip broke off, making it only half as useful to me. (-1 star) My only other complaint is with the price. For $35 I would expect it to last many years or include engraving (for only $15 extra i could use an ipod shuffle for a money clip)... But since you'll use it every day it is still a decent value. However for my next money clip I'm going to try a similar product I found on amazon for only $10. If it's not as good, I'll reluctantly return and buy another "smart" money clip. <end>  Smart Money Clip  Excellent - bought it for my husband for Father's Day - he loves it! Hates carrying a big, bulging wallet in his back pocket! <end>  Total Junk  It is bulky, ugly and useless. I sent mine back to tv boys, or whatever their name was, even though they charged me return shipping and acted like they were doing me a favor. <end>
 B000OB7ONQ  Grey Freshwater Cultured Pearl and Peridot Chip Necklace (9-9.5mm), 17" ||	  A bit disappointed...  Grey Freshwater 9-9.5mm Cultured Pearl and Peridot Chip Necklace, 17"When I received the necklace I was disappointed that it did not meet my expectation. The grey pearls have a dividing line through them as though the two halves were fused together. I have other peridot jewelry which I love. The finish on the chips resemble little fragments of unpolished gems...did not like it in actuality, had to return them, sorry! <end>  It Broke  It broke and could not be replaced, therefore I was both inconvenienced in that I had to return it, and dissatisfied, as it was my wife's Mother's Day present, and it was broken the first day through no fault of hers or mine. <end>
 B000OMIWDG  14k Gold 7-Stone Diamond Ring (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  I love this ring!  I just got this from my husband for an anniversary gift. I love it! It is very beautiful and does not look cheap at all. The diamonds look great and sparkle in the light. We have a young baby now so I had been unable to wear my engagement ring which was a solitaire diamond ring since I did not want to scratch the baby. But I was feeling empty without a ring on my finger. This is a perfect replacement to wear until our baby is older and I can wear my original engagement ring again! <end>  Beautiful Ring very nicely priced  After searching several jewelry sites I thought I'd give Amazon a shot. Was pleasantly surprised to find exactly what I was looking for at a great price.This ring is gorgeous. <end>  can't beat the price  As stated in the other reviews, this is a petite ring. The diamonds are small and the band is very dainty, but the look is exactly what I wanted for an anniversary band and looks great on my small hand. (For your reference, I ordered a size 5 and will likely have to size it down to a 4.5 when I am no longer 8.5 months pregnant!) If you're looking for a delicate band with a lot of sparkle, you simply can't beat the price on this one. Just one star off because I agree that they should offer a point of reference for the scale of the ring, just so people won't be surprised/disappointed. <end>  My wife loves this ring  I bought this ring as a wedding band to go with my wife's engagement ring. When I opened the box there was a "wow" moment. It was just the right ring and it looks beautiful next to the engagement ring. It also comes in a handsome box. I was a little skeptical about buying a ring like this on Amazon but the easy return policy made it worth it. We bought the wrong size initially but returned it for the correct one. The total cost was only the return shipping (about 3 dollars). We would have spent more than that driving around to jewelry stores trying to find something as nice and it probably would have been more expensive. The most important thing is that my wife loves it. I catch her looking down to her finger pretty often. <end>  Christmas gift  I got the ring and I really liked it. The diamonds are very pretty. They are exactly as the rating described. The only reservation I have is the shank of the ring looked much heavier than it is. The gold is thinner than I wanted. But the ring looks good up against my wedding band. I am happy with it. <end>  Absolutely Gorgeous Ring!!!!  I received this ring as an anniversary present from my boyfriend and I absolutely love it!!! It really does have a ton of sparkle! After reading the reviews, I did expect it to be shiny, but it certainly exceeded my expectations! I would definitely recommend buying this ring to anyone! Not only will it make a wonderful anniversary present, but it would make a beautiful wedding band as well. The ring is slim, elegant, very comfortable and definitely looks expensive (would have never guessed it is worth only $216)!!! I've been to many jewelry stores and to be honest, I did not find a single diamond band I liked and they were all at least $600. This one is perfect! I cannot stop staring at it, especially at the right light, when I almost get blinded by the rainbow-colored sparkles! My friends are so jealous!  ) <end>  Exactly what I was looking for!  I was looking for a small wedding band that wasnt too plain. I have a thin(2 mm) engagement ring with a large center stone. This is the perfect band to enhance a similar ring or stand on its own. If youre looking for a big ring with a lot of bling, this is not for you. But if youre looking for something smaller with simple elegance, this is the one for you! <end>  Love it  I love this ring. I got it for my wedding band and it goes perfectly with my engagement ring. I have very petite hands and it looks great (and not too) flashy on them. Thinking about ordering another one to surround my engagement ring. <end>  I like it until  I got this beautiful ring for my wife as a gift. The edges are square as in the picture - not rounded. The two outer diamonds are only held by two prongs -not 4 like the others. Within three months of wearing it maybe once a week, one of the outer diamonds fell out. Now it is not so beautiful. I would have expected that from a cheaper ring. <end>  love it!  It's a good ring for this price. One of the stones, you can tell is of less quality than the others, but otherwise really nice ring. Worth the price. <end>  Hard to judge the size with no reference point  The ring looks fine online but was so surprisingly small once we received it. A point of reference shot would have helped avoid this problem. I suggest looking at at least .5 cttw, it is not much more and it looks so much better. <end>
 B000ONG69C  Sterling Silver Oval Blue Topaz Ring ||	  Elegant!  I absolutely love this ring! It is plain but very elegant. The gem is not too big in size either. It looks very nice on my ring finger. Shipping was fast too. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I love my ring! I've not had it quite a month yet, but I've worn it everyday since I received it, and it looks as lovely today as it did the first day! I've also had many compliments about how pretty it is--and I just love this; it is confirmation that I have made a great purchase and I am enjoying it immensely! <end>  it looks like a popcorn ring  the ring has a very nice cut if you exzamine it but it still presents itself as a cheap toy. <end>  mi ring  thats nice v e r y n i c e - t h a n c k s , , <end>  "Tiffany" being kind to the wallet  )  Yep, and I mean it. My wife had it on her with some Tiffany items and I could not trace it on her  ) The aura of the ring is very fresh and gives kind of a Spring mood. Nice piece. <end>  great ring, great price  I absolutely love this ring. Big enough to be showy, but not obnoxious. The quality is good too. Not heavy enough to swing the stone to the side. I agree with other posts that the blue is lighter in person than in the picture featured online. It resembles more an aquamarine than a standard blue topaz but I, for one, am not disappointed. A beautiful ring, and you can't beat the price.PS The packaging it came in is also very nice, in case you would like to offer it as a gift. <end>  Very pretty!  Again, another lovely jewelry item from Amazon! The blue topaz is a light, icy blue. The stone is a good size and makes a nice presentation on the simple silver setting. The packaging is remarkable -- nicer than you will get from many jewelers. The ring fits true to size. Speedy delivery with Amazon Prime. I'm a happy customer. <end>  Beautiful  It originally came damaged but this company responded quickly and sent out a replacement. The ring is very pretty and looks like it cost a lot more than I paid for it. I am happy with this purchase <end>  Blue Topaz ring  I purchased this ring to replace an aquamarine one I'd had for over 40 years. The color is brillant and quality very good. It is comfortable and I can highly recommend it! <end>  beautiful  Looks better than the picture on line, size is good match to my normal size. Love this ring ,would buy others like this. <end>  Just do it!  I absolutely love this ring! The blue might be ever so slightly lighter than the picture but not by much and I found the size fit me perfectly. The stone is a very generous size, its so large in fact that it works as a cocktail ring and I get tons of compliments when I wear it! I did not have high expectations for the price and I was totally blown away when it arrived. So I ordered the matching necklace as well. It is also a great piece with an identical stone in size and colour and it comes on a nice box chain. If you're thinking of ordering either of these pieces, JUST DO IT! You won't regret it. <end>  Truth is beautiful and was surprised  Still not give it to my wife and I am waiting for a particular date, but I think you'll love.Some critics had read that the color was not expected, in this case the opposite, the same color to the picture. Looks great!!Todavia no se lo entregue a mi esposa ya que estoy esperando una fecha en particular, pero creo que le va a encantar.En algunas criticas habia leido que el color no era lo esperado, en este caso todo lo contrario, el color es Igual al de la foto. Luce espectacular!! <end>  Rhonda  I was not satisfied with this purchase. It did not look the same as it did online. It didn't fitas the other ring I purchased. It sits in the box because I've waited too long to return it. <end>  Great Deal  What a beautiful ring! The stone is a light clear blue and the silver is substantial for the low cost. I recommend this ring as it is a great deal. <end>  Love this ring!  Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this ring for the money. Stone is large and a beautiful shade of blue. Ring itself is good weight. A lot of ring for the money <end>  Large and Sparkly  My birthstone is blue topaz. I bought this ring for myself and was very pleased with the quality of the product. It's large, a beautiful shade of blue and very sparkly. I really like it a lot. Great value for the price. <end>  Oval Blue Topaz Ring  Excellent quality and the color of the ring is the same indicated by the picture. Buy it and you will also be satified by the purchase. <end>  Love it!  For this price, my expectations were low, but I was pleasantly surprised! The stone is large, and its dimensions make the pale blue sparkle from the sides. The band is substantial but runs just a tad big. I actually bought this for "Santa" to give to me (Mom) along with presents for my daughter, and was frustrated that I couldn't wear it until I opened presents on Christmas day  ) <end>  Nice Ring  Just got this last night and the color is true to the picture. Size felt a little big but not too bag. The stone is a little smaller than I expected, but not too small. <end>  Blue Topaz Ring  I love this ring. Substantial setting and looks great on my wide fingers. Time will tell if the settings holds up to casual wear. <end>  Love it.  looks great. good deal for the size of stone and for real .925 silver. Yes it has a hallmark on it. looks almost as blue as photo. But if it was darker you would be paying more.update...................................................................I wish I could take off 3 stars the stone came out of my ring after the review. I also don't have the paper work to try and take it back or fix it. <end>  Simple but beautiful  The ring is beautiful--my colleagues complimented me on it right away. The setting is simple but sturdy and well-made, and the stone is large, very clear, and well-cut. The color is paler than on the picture, which is the only thing I can comment negatively on. In all other aspects, however, it is a very pretty ring that I would be glad to wear everyday. <end>  Stone Fell Out  The ring is beautiful, but the stone was loose in the package when it arrived.I'm going to return it tomorrow. <end>  Blue topaz ring  I chose it for the lovely color of the stone. I was a bit disappointed at the plainness of the ring itself. <end>  Just OK  I purchased this ring based on reviews ...it was ok. Interesting though, I have received several compliments on it. The stone is certainly large enough; but I though the band was a bit on the chintzy side to support a stone this big. Certainly worth the money - as long as you have realistic expectations. You get what you pay for. <end>  Beautiful!!!!  I got this for my daughter, but I want one now! It looks even better in person! The picture does not do it justice. It is beautiful and looks much more expensive than what I paid for it! Great gift! <end>  You too can have a piece of the sky!  The metal for this ring is stunning. It shines and glistens in the sunlight. The stone itself is a beautiful and peaceful blue. The stone sparkles and gleams when it hits the sun or any type of lighting. Also, the stone is just the right size. It doesn't topple over to rest under your finger, it stays put for anyone to admire. I would order this ring over and over again! <end>  very stunning  I just got that ring today and I was surprised of how much it sparkles. it is just stunning... very nice setting in solid sterling silver. the stone is a very nice sky blue, which I personally love and as i said it sparkles stunningly.I'd definitely recommend this ring, great value! <end>  Nice ring, great price.  I buy this for my daughter. I was tired of her fingers turning black from 'cheap' rings. This was a great way to buy a nice ring for her and not have to worry if she lost it. <end>  couln`t believe what I was seeing  I was so excited about the ring coming even though I had read reviews that it was light in color that would have been ok. but when I opened mine It was only blue around the edges, It is completely clear in the middle with no color. It is the funniest thing I have ever seen I`m embarassed to wear it. (Sterling Silver Blie Topaz Ring) <end>  Beautiful color of blue topaz ring  I ordered this for myself last year for my birthday and I love it. It's a lovely color of blue. Can't go wrong w/this ring & it's sterling silver. I highly recommend it to anyone needing a great gift idea. <end>  Great buy!  This ring was exactly what I was looking for. Simple, delicate, but large enough to be noticed. And the price was fantastic. Thanks Overstock! <end>  Great purchase  Well, it hasn't turned my girlfriend's finger green. Its not stamped sterling, but I'm fairly certain its at least a silver alloy. I don't know about gems to say if its actually a real blue topaz, but it certainly looks nice and it was worth the $25 I spent on it. <end>  Love it!!!!  I love the color in the stone.....it's sooo pretty......I just love it!!! I love buying jewelry on Amazon.....my favorite Santa! <end>  Blue Opal Ring  Beautiful ring, excellent gift for a woman. It arrived on time and in perfect conditions.Highly recommended. I bought it as a gift for my mother, I'm sure she is going to like it.The customer support was really good, they answered every question I had on the shipping and delivery of the item in a very friendly and efficient way. <end>  Question about size  Is there any way I can get the ring in a larger size than what you have offered? If so how can I order it in that size <end>  Sterling Silver Oval Blue Topaz Ring  I will be more than happy to review this gorgeous ring. I wear it often and receive many compliments. Anyone who purchases this will be more than satisfied. <end>  Wow, compliments galore!!  Bought this ring on a whim - and I am so glad I did.I have had many compliments, and inquires as to where I purchased this piece. (love you Amazon)I really was concerned that the stone might be too large for my hand but the stone is a great size. Large enough to bring attention and not so large as to overwhelm the finger.The color of this stone is beautiful, clear and crisp and the cut of the stone lets the color shine through.The setting is smooth so there is no snagging on clothes and the silver sets it off so well.I have purchased two more of these rings as gifts. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I truly love this ring and have received a lot of compliments when I wear it. The stone is a gorgeous ocean blue and with the diamond cutting, it really sparkles in the sunlight. You will not be disappointed if you get this ring. <end>  Fabulous Ring  The sterling silver oval blue topaz ring is fabulous! It is exactly as I thought it would be; sparkles and shines the way it should without any cloudiness or imperfections visible to the naked eye. <end>  Great color  Bought as a gift. The color of the topaz was lighter than pictured, but the person I bought it for loved it! Simple yet nice setting. <end>  Pretty!  I like the ring, it's big, shiny and inexpensive (I paid $25). The band is silver and is good quality. The stone is pretty eye catching and I've gotten lots of compliments. <end>  Not the same as pictures  In my case the ring pictured is a bit different than the ring I received  the silver on the ring I received is thinner - inside of the ring is full in pic but most of it hollow in person, gem has much less details and top is quite flat not like the pic, stone color is darker... If you are lucky you will receive a nice ring, otherwise you will receive something slightly different than what you thought you bought. Used a Amazon gift certificate and will not send back but no more jewelry through Amazon. <end>  NICE STONE  Excellent cut,high grade stone,nice setting.My mother loves it.I would highly reccomend buying one.topaz is a beautiful stone and these are nice ones. <end>  beautiful color  the ring is really very pretty but it doesn't have the weight of a real quality ring...but hey they are so inexpensive you can get several and have quite the collection of jewelery...and the choices are plenty on style, etc....i will be getting more! <end>  It's Okay  I like the ring, but I am not 100% happy with the color. Blue Topaz is my birth stone and I LOVE the color online, nut it is much lighter in color in person. <end>  No Way this is Sterling  It is very bright and pretty, but the weight of the ring is very light and feels cheap. Still a t good deal for what I paid though. <end>  Bling  Purchased two, one for each twin daughter as a special 50th birthday gift. Would have preferred not made in China but didn't see that during purchase process <end>  Pretty for price  Got for a Teen girl she seems happy with this, got the matching earings and necklace liked both of those also. <end>  Blue topaz ring  Not happy with this ring. Looks nothing like the picture. The stone looks fake and the band is thin, very lightweight, just flimsy!Would send back but my husband opened it and threw all packing away. <end>  Can't Stop Looking At It  Got this last night, and I can't stop looking at it. It's GORGEOUS! It is indeed paler than in the picture, and it's oval, not round, like in the picture. I think the photograph could have been more realistic. But I'm very happy with it. The stone is large enough to get attention, but not obnoxious. I have another blue topaz ring that's absolutely huge - it looks like a swimming pool. I love that one, but I can't wear it much because it gets in the way. Not with this one. It's just the right size. Love it!March 30, 2012  Still wearing it, still loving it...and still can't stop looking at it! <end>  Very pretty ring  I received this very lovely ring and was thrilled with the color and style. The only concern I had is that the ring seems slightly big for the size i usually wear. I would purchase more jewelry from amazon again after this experience. <end>  in loooooooove with this ring  this ring is soooooo beautiful. the stone is nice & big & clear & shiny. its just beautiful. the quality of the ring is outstanding. the fit was a little bit big. i usually wear a size 6 but for some reason this ring was loose on my finger & i was kinda disappointed about that. regardless, it's still a great ring for a great price  ) <end>  Fall in love when I recived this.  I bought it for my mother for a little present.I was "dumbfounded" when I saw it in person.Just great product.Silver seems like gold. The stone is great.Price is ok. <end>  Great Price Beautiful Ring  I was pleasantly surprised how beautiful this ring is. It is lighter blue than the picture, however, stone is clear and setting polished with no flaws. <end>  love it!  I'm thrilled - The stone is very clean and and bright. The color is not very deep, but we should all expect that -considering the cost.It looks like a lot of fun - and certainly catches the eye. Wait till my husband notices! (He won't believe the price!) <end>  Please... $$$  This is a nice stone. Quite handsome in fact. It's not dark, but it's not a London Blue. I bought mine, and intend to put it into a different setting w/ a local jeweler. Could wear it as it came tho... it's a really nice piece for the price. SS <end>  Perfect!  This turned out to be a beautiful ring at an unbeatable prize. I would buy another one with a different gemstone! Great buy! <end>  Everything I expected!  The ring arived on time and was packaged well. The ring itself is exactly what I was expecting and at a great price. <end>  Bigger in person  This is a beautiful ring, the stone is gorgeous. My one gripe is that, in person, the stone looks much larger than in the picture. I have very small hands and this looks a little silly on my fingers. <end>  Lovely Blue Topaz Ring  Sterling Silver Oval Blue Topaz RingI have received many compliments about this ring. I love it! <end>  A "once in a life time" blue topaz ring  A ring with a stone so large and beautiful is to be rarely found at such a value. The shade of blue is light and cooling. The sterling silver setting is strong, and it's simplicity draws attention to the magnificent stone. It's a sparkling eye-catcher! I purchased one ring for myself and, after I saw it, I decided to get complete sets (ring, pendant & earrings) for all of our family's December birthdays. They will be thrilled, and I am delighted! <end>  Pretty  I get a lot of compliments on this. It's really pretty for the price and fun. <end>  linda in liberty  Just received this ring...it is very striking. The color is a bit lighter than the picture, but I think I like the lighter color better. It is the perfect size stone for me. I would recommend this to all my friends and family. <end>  Lovely ring, large stone  I ordered the wrong size but that's not the seller's fault, obviously. Other than having to wear the ring on my index finger, I'm enjoying it. The stone looks bigger on my hand than I'd anticipated but I'm getting used to being "ostentatious". <end>  Beautiful and well worth it!  I do not buy many gemstones and was nervous as I waited for this ring to arrive in the mail. But I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened the box! It is gorgeous! It comes in a very nice silver setting and the stone is absolutely beautiful. I can not say enough how pleased I am with this ring. If you are tempted to purchase it, you won't regret it - it is WELL worth the money! <end>  Simple setting simply stunning  Beautiful! The price is so much lower than what you would expect for something so pretty and well crafted. The blue is clear, not too light or too dark. And, the cut is great, it flashes sparkles with even the smallest amount of light. I LOVE it. <end>  Beautiful, well worth the price  It is a beautiful ring that calls a lot of attention. It is paler than the picture but that does not take away from it's beauty. It well worth the price you pay. Will definitely buy from them again. <end>  prettier than the online picture  I waited for over a month after the purchase of this ring to submit my review because I didn't want to write about first impressions - I thought the presentation of this ring was excellent, but wanted to see what my opinion of the ring was after wearing it for awhile. I really like it today as much as I did when I opened the box! The band is daintier than it looked to me in the picture, and the gem colour is a very pretty ice blue, definately more blue than an aquamarine. I've been wearing it every day, and still enjoy seeing it on my hand when I'm typing at work - it really sparkles! <end>  Luxury on a budget, beautiful  I absolutely love this ring! I wish they had more rings this size in other gems. Especially for the price! After shopping around for large, single stone genuine gemstone rings at nearby jewelry stores and the mall, I found that Amazon had the best prices in Sterling Silver. I also love that this ring is sterling silver because you get a much larger stone than in rings made from gold or platinum.I have made many many online purchases (including my engagement ring) and was not worried about this purchase whatsoever, but I still was surprised at the absolute beauty of the stone and the shiny silver of the setting. This ring is the size and price of a costume jewelry piece, but it is all genuine (including the setting, which is stamped with the 925 silver stamp) - and it glitters much more than a fake gem! I am only beginning to appreciate genuine stones, but the difference was surprising.My ring appears slightly different than the picture, in terms of the cutouts on the side of the ring, and the color is slightly lighter than the picture - but it is not clear, by any means. It is more a sky blue color than medium blue. One other note, the cut is gorgeous from the top with lots of facets, but it has just the slightest "roughness" around the outside rim. This roughness cannot actually be felt, but if you look very very closely it is visible. It does not affect the beauty of the ring, but it may matter for some buyers. In all other respects the stone is luxurious.I would rebuy this ring in a heartbeat and would be very proud to give it as a gift to any of my loved ones. <end>  Beautiful but  A beautiful piece, and well worth the money, but not the color it shows to be on the website. It's significantly lighter than the website photo. <end>  Showy size, very very pale  Nice ring, good size for my large hands, but it no way matches the color of the picture. If you're looking for a light turquoise color or aqua colored ring, this is not it. It's like water--more clear than blue. But it's well faceted, and not horrible for the price. <end>  Nice ring but color is paler than the picture.  I received this ring today and am pleased with the purchase except for the color. The blue is paler than the picture. Nice solitare with a simple band for an excellent price. <end>  disappointed  Granted I only spent $22 on this ring and so maybe I should not have had high expectations, but I did expect it to last more than one week of normal usage. The prongs of the setting kept catching on clothing, and they bent almost immediately, the stone became loose and then while I was trying to bend a prong back to secure the stone, the prong broke completely off. The prongs on my ring were not nearly so smooth looking as the photos show. It was a very pretty ring, but unfortunately, not made to last. <end>  Good purchase  I agree with the reviewer who said this ring is pale. It is not as deep a blue as you would see at a jewlery store or even Walmart (I went there yesterday to compare). However, I like it. It is still a pretty blue and large, although not large enough to look tacky or anything. The mount is strong and sturdy, and holds the stone well. All in all I am glad I purchased this and will continue to wear it with my favorite blue sweater! <end>  Nearly Perfect  This ring is beautiful. I really trust Amazon to only include quality items in their &#34;Amazon Curated Collection.&#34; The Topaz is clear and the color is very similar in person to the pictures of the ring. Well done Amazon! <end>  Beautiful Ring  This ring is as pretty as the picture! I love the color and clarity and it fits well. The price was great also! <end>  Simple Elegance  I love my birthstone and I wanted a piece of jewelry that symbolized the simple purity of the Blue Topaz. This ring did that for me. As a gift to myself for my birthday this year, it was definitely a great gift and a welcomed addition to my collection. <end>  Beautiful  Stone is large and clear. This ring is just beautiful in person. Sizing seems correct too. Great ring for the price. <end>  Great product, great price  I was very impressed with the price of this product, and it is a good product. My wife loves it. <end>  So in LOVE with this ring!!!  I am so very happy with my purchase!!! I was so excited when I received it that I ripped the box open and put it on immediately. Unlike some of the other post, my ring is THE perfect shade of blue. I couldn't be happierThank you Amazon  ) <end>  Beautiful and crystal clear  This ring is really beautiful!!! The stone is big and clear and shines with the light. It is a GREAT buy! <end>  Beautiful & an amazing deal!!  I Purchased this ring as a birthday present for my mother, it's her birthstone.I was a little worried at first about buying jewelry online,but when I opened the package today I was sooo happy that I did!!! It is Beautiful and i just can't wait to give it to my mother!!!Bottom Line Yes I would definitely recommend this!!!! <end>  Blue Topaz Ring  Ring is BEAUTIFUL. Sizing was perfect. My sister-in-law is going to love it. This is her birthstone and way cheaper that the 400% mark up at the jewelry stores! <end>  Great ring fantastic price!  Love this ring. Nice size and beautiful color. Great setting strong enough for everyday wear. I wear my rings when I do everything even house work. I would highly recommend this ring! <end>

 B000OV0RJY  10k White Gold Round Cluster Diamond Ring (1/4 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Nice size, doesn't sparkle  I asked for this ring for my birthday because my friend has the same design and its gorgeous on her. When it arrived, I was extremely disappointed. The sizes of the stones were fine, a little on the small side, but the imperfections were obvious even to my untrained eye. The most disappointing thing was that it just didn't sparkle even in the sunlight. I was wearing a diamond band from Costco and it sparkles beautifully. There was an article on CNN about the differences between purchasing diamonds from Costco & Tiffany's and the conclusion was that you do get quality diamonds from Costco and its well worth it. At least with Costco, you can see the diamonds before hand. I love Amazon but I strongly don't recommend it for jewels. You just don't know what you're getting no matter how many reviews you read. <end>  Beatiful ring  I bought this ring to my mother. It was great, wonderful. Stones shine incredibly. The price was very low. I recommend you to buy it. <end>

 B000OV6UM2  Sterling Silver Gray Cats Eye Stone 8mm Bead Stud Earrings ||	  Not what I thought...  I love cats eye jewelry, so I figured these earrings would be great. I recieved these earrings and was very disappointed. Not only did they look poorly made, but they were HUGE! I don't see how they expect anyone to wear these. I would not recommend these to ANYONE. <end>
 B000OVCIT6  Amazon.com  Red Hat Society Rhinestone Initial &quot;B&quot; Pin  Clothing ||	  Redhat Pin  Ordered for Mother in law's Bday. She loved it! It is very nice. As advertised! Very nice to do business with,Recommend! <end>
 B000OVJWGS  1000 Silver U-Pins Jewelry Display Chain Pad Showcase ||	  U pins not sturdy  I purchased these "Tidy Pins/U pins" as I was not sure I could get some more Dritz ones. For my purpose they are not sturdy enough. Kept then as it wa going to cost more to ship them back than they cost. Maybe some day I will find a use for them. <end>
 B000OVJWH2  Black Velvet Bangle Bracelet Display Tray Jewelry Case ||	  great for bangle storage and travel  I lines an entire drawer with these and they are great for bangles and rings. The jewelry doesn't get scratched or tangled. When I go on vacation, I combine two boxes together to create a case for my bangles <end>
 B000OVJWPE  White Leather Ring Finger Jewelry Holder Showcase Display Stand ||	  Fine Ring Stand  There is nothing to complain about with this well-made ring stand. As advertised, it is made of either white leather or a plastic similar to leather. The whole piece is glued together well with the ends tucked away securely. It is about 2 inches high, and will fit rings from size 1 to size 9.I have collected a number of jewelry stands so far, and I find that the flocked ones collect all kinds of lint. I cannot even keep up with the collection of lint with a sticky lint roller. As fast as I clear it off, more will collect.This problem is not an issue with this white leather stand. It stays clean and nice and I don't have to keep it in a plastic bag. I would highly recommend it. <end>
 B000OVJX9Y  3 Sided Black Rotating Revolving Earrings Countertop Display Holds 108 2" Cards ||	  works, but is flimsy  Cheaply made, unattractive pieces of plastic. Nothing on it has broken on me yet, but I can foresee it happening as soon as I need to travel with it. I would recommend spending just a few dollars more and getting something more durable and attractive. <end>  looks good bur flimsy  This is a good looking rack, but is pretty flimsy. Arms have been steadily breaking off since I started using it. If you have to shlep your stuff bacvk and forth to markets, I do not recommend it. But if you will be keeping it in one place, then it's a stylish cheap alternative. <end>  One star for design  This earrings display is definitely not worth the money and detracts from what you are trying to sell. It is flimsy, the plastic scratches and breaks easily. Mine broke during assembly before I got to use it. It will surely not hold up to customers rotating it around by the tips of the thin, brittle plastic arms and it won't be their fault. There are metal ones out there that are more attractive and cost less. Do yourself a favor and skip this overpriced piece of junk. <end>  3-sided Black Rotating revolving earring countertop display  This thing was a flimsy piece of crap that fell apart within the first 15-minutes we used it. The screws fell out of the vertical parts and the tabs that hold the earring cards snap off if you barely touch them. Do not buy this, its a waste of money. Crap like this should be removed from the Amazon marketplace. <end>
 B000OVK4F6  500 Jewelry Price Tags Ring Chain Store Display Sticker ||	  perfect  I purchased these for a party I had sold a lot of jewelery at... they were easy to apply, and didnt smudge when priced or held! <end>  Tags  I was so glad to find these tags. I use them to price and label my handcrafted bracelets.I've been unable to find them local to where I live, so I was very happy to find them. Also, pleased with priceAnd quick shipping. <end>  Terrific and Easy to Use  I wasn't sure what kind of labels to use to price my products! This was a great choice! Prices show up clearly and on both sides! I am so happy I chose this label! <end>  Just what I needed  This is a good product for labeling jewerly. However, sometimes the pen would stop writing and I would write on an envelope or other paper and then I could continue. It does stick good.I would recommend to friend. <end>  Great tags for jewelry of all kinds!  The narrow center part has no &#34;goo&#34; so your jewelry stays stick-um free and the tag is easily removed with scissors. Great! <end>
 B000OVK4FQ  300 Gold String Price Tags Jewelry Ring Sale Display ||	  Durable and Attractive  I used these for the jewelry in my store and have really liked them. They have a sturdier string that a lot of other tags I've seen, and are nice and small so they don't distract from the jewelry. I also really liked the gold color. My only complaint is that the surface is very plastic-y, so you definitely have to use a fine tip permanent marker to write on them, and blow it dry or don't touch it for a bit before it's ready to go. Otherwise, really nice tags. <end>  Tabs  Very, very small! My fault, should have looked closer. About .5&#34; x 3/4&#34; maybe. But, plenty of them. Thank you. <end>
 B000OVK4II  Black Oriental Ring Gift Box Jewelry Showcase Display ||	  Elegant design but cheaply made  It looks really classy and elegant in the photo but it is not crafted very well. Think asian gift shop quality. The leatherette exterior had dents in it and the interior piece was roughly cut. Brass highlights are nice and it comes in a black cardboard box. At this price, I didnt expect too much anyway. <end>  Ring box-  The ring box was just like a typical ring box. I didn't like the way it shut though. The spring showed wear and cheapness. <end>  Exotic and expensive in appearance. Excellent presentation  2 boxes in the order. Couldn't be happier. These look just like their description  like granny's old trunk in the attic but extremely well preserved. The leatherette exterior is impressive and is adorned with brass locking mechanism that closes with a snap and secures very well and brass corner protectors. The interior is white leatherette and quite rich in appearance. No matter what type ring is placed inside, these boxes just add to the specialness. I would purchase these again in a heartbeat. <end>  Nice product  Really nice product for the price. It has an oriental look, and compliments a ring. I do wish the interior color was available in red or black. <end>
 B000OVNMAA  25 Black Gem Jars Box Coin Jewelry Display Travel Tray ||	  Not worth the price  The item exterior covering is low quality. It was made in Taiwan back when Taiwan still was "Made in China" so this item, while new, feels like it has been sitting in a warehouse for a generation. You can search around Amazon and find a superior product for about $17. <end>
 B000OVNMGY  25 Silver Cotton Boxes Necklace Gift Jewelry Displays 6 1/8" ||	  Fantasic  These boxes are absolutely fantasic...they are very pretty, the silver accents on the box are shaped into what looks like falling leaves. The texture of the box is also lovely. You can feel each little silver fleck on the box. The box is also very sturdy as well as roomy. I really recommend these boxes. <end>
 B000OVNMJQ  100 Gray Hanging Earring Cards Jewelry Counter Displays 2" ||	  Exactly what I needed.  Nice, inexpensive finish to handmade earrings. Great for hanging displays at street faires. Seller is prompt and reliable. <end>
 B000OVNNR2  2 Black Flocked Ring Gift Boxes Jewelry Displays ||	  Simple, elegant, perfect  I bought two of these for the wedding bands. They worked like a charm and are beautiful in that they have a simple, elegant design. At the price I got them they are a steal. Note of caution, it looks like the insert for the ring can support rings as wide as 4mm. If you have wider rings, especially if they are flat rings, you may have problems fitting them in these boxes. <end>  great value  its a great value for the price. the 2 boxes are wonderful for giving as gifts. <end>  Very Nice  Very Nice Boxes, small but good size and the black its pretty dark and nice. NOt heavy boxes at all. <end>  tight fit for an 8mm ring  its pretty tight for an 8mm ring set. you would have to put slight pressure to make it fit inside. <end>  LOVE IT'  Even you put heavy stuff in the bag, you put it on your shoulder. It's light. Amazing! I love it. <end>
 B000OVNSN6  100 Gold String Price Tags Jewelry Ring Sale Display ||	  Won't buy again  These tags are difficult to write on because of a glossy finish. They made my jewelry look classy, but I won't buy them again. The seller is great to work with. <end>  good size.  These are the perfect size, the only thing is that you have to write the price on with a felt tip pen. A regular pen does not work. The do look really classy on the jewelry though and the price was right. <end>
 B000OVPAW8  White Leather Square Base Ring Finger Jewelry Holder Showcase Display Stand ||	  Not as nice as pictured.  Looks nice on the picture. Poor made. Air bubbles throughout the "finger part". Very cheap looking display. Wouldn't recommend it. <end>
 B000OVPBNG  3 Pouches Black Velvet Drawstring Jewelry Bags 5" ||	  nice bag  It is pretty good bag for smart phones.It closes half way for larger phones such as iphone but that's good enough since there's nothing that can fall out from it.4"x5.5" would been perfect for that purpose.It almost feel like back side of leather.Anyway, you can get 3 of these for phone or pay more for one that specifically made. <end>  PRODUCT NOT WHAT DESCRIBED  Although I didn't have a problem with the quality of the bags, the measurments were inaccurate from what the product description said. Product description says the bags are four and one fourth inches by five inches. Actual bags I received were three and a half inches by five inches. I'm in the process of returning them right now. <end>
 B000OVPBYA  100 Cotton Boxes White Pendant Chain Charm Jewelry Displays 2 5/8" ||	  They are great!  My boxes arrived in great time and in good condition. They are perfect for packaging my smaller jewelry items for shipping or even when I sell at trade shows. They are also stuffed with the cotton padding as stated. I am definitely pleased. <end>
 B000OVPCLC  100 Silver Paper Gift Bags Shopping Tote Sales Bag 11 x 8" ||	  I like the look  I love the look. It was what I wanted and was the rigtht size it has a good look. Great <end>
 B000OVPDG6  2 Black Bracelet Watch Gift Boxes Jewelry Display Box ||	  Surprise!  Full disclosure  I didn't actually use these to hold watches or bracelets. I put an engagement ring in one and surprised the heck out of my now-fiance. However, they are nice quality boxes, and I'm sure they'd also work fine for their intended purpose. <end>  Great  These were great for giving bracelets for xmas. They could be a little bit longer but they still fit a bracelet nice. <end>  Decent product  Fulfill its purpose but clearly has the looks of something made cheaply which makes your gift look less valuable, so decent product. <end>  great  great product velvet with elastic attachments in side to give elegant look to any jewelry purchase at gift time or holiday <end>  Better quality than perceived  These are not very big boxes but they are good quality for the price no doubt. They have a hard outer shell (Not cardboard), good spring hinges, completely lined in soft velvet on the outside and on the inside where the bracelet lays. It has two sturdy "Bands" for holding in a full size bracelet (Up to 9" in length on the inside. I got a men's 9" long x 1/2" wide bracelet to fit in it with no problem). They are not "Full size" boxes though, they are great if you want something that is functional and at the same time, takes up less space in a jewelry box. Only one of the top inserts was loose and came out of the 12 that I ordered. It was easily super-glued back in without another incident. For the price, I wont complain one bit. You couldn't get one fancy cardboard full size box for even half of what one of these hard cases would sell for. Not with the free shipping any way! They work just fine, look just fine and with the jewelry I got these for I would gladly order more in a heartbeat! <end>  Perfect  I bought my wife a new watch and tennis bracelet for her birthday and needed a box to put them in and these were perfect. Nice and clean and not cheap looking at all.. <end>  Junk  These bracelett boxes are junk. The inner liners are all puckered and not properly adhered. Not worth returning, I am throwing these away. <end>  Look elsewhere . . . .  I considered these poor quality and felt and looked cheap. Not something I wanted to use as gift packaging. So they have gone back, at a $6 cost to me, and I am still looking for a good quality gift box. Save your money. <end>  Good for what it's made for  I bought these not to put a necklace in but i got my friend concert tickets and i wanted to give them to her in a different way so overall the products is perfect for necklaces but the tickets were too wide to fit in the case. The only suggestion i have is to list the dimensions in the product description. Other than it not working for my intended purpose, i felt the quality was good and it gets the job done. <end>
 B000OVPIES  Black Ring Display Easel Showcase Countertop Jewelry Fixture ||	  very cheap  I was very disappointed with this product. The frame is made of cheap styrofoam. When it arrived it was damaged and dented in several places. The "easel stand" is just a thin piece of cardboard that isn't even close to functional. What a waste. Needless to say I'm returning immediately. <end>  Ring holder works  I do like this set up to show my silver rings. Wish the stand to keep it upright was a little heavier. But in total it works. <end>
 B000OWDW2C  Genuine Rose Quartz Stone Chip Confetti Toggle Bracelet ||	  Nice bracelet  This is a nice bracelet. It's definitely unique, but it looks alot more different than in the picture. The picture makes it look more full, whereas when you receive the it, you notice that the rose quartz beads are not woven all around the bracelet...more like branches on a tree. You have "branches" with the rose quartz beads attached to it. Overall, I like the product. <end>
 B000OWJI98  Solid Sterling Silver Bead Spacers ||	  Very Nice!  I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I bought these spacer beads. I wasn't sure as to how many I was getting or if they'd be of good quality. I needn't have worried. They look just like the picture, and there were five of them, just like the picture. They will definitely work to separate the pendants on the necklace I'm finishing for my mom for Christmas. I am very pleased with this order and would recommend them to anyone thinking about getting these. <end>
 B000OWL8FK  AugustinaJewelry Freshwater Cultured Pearls Set 18 Inches 1-Strand 6-7mm Black Pearl Necklace & 6-7mm Black Pearl Earrings ||	  HORRIBLE DONT BUY  I purchased these for my mother for Christmas and she wore them and her neck turned black. They came with what looked like a certificate of authenticity, but obviously if they were real, they wouldn't have turned her neck black. <end>
 B000OX7ORK  14K White Gold Signet Ring ||	  great customer service  Diva Diamonds is great on customer service. The ring is a pretty ring. However, it came in the wrong size. So, I did not keep the ring. <end>
 B000OX9YQ4  Platinum Heavy Comfort Fit Band - 3 mm ||	  Excellent  Great quality at a very competitive price. Platinum is expensive and this ring is not light, but is well worth it. <end>
 B000OYMPLO  Sterling Silver Garnet 7-Stone Ring, Size 8 ||	  Garnet is really darker then what I got  The ring itself is very pretty, delicate looking an eye catching if you have no other rings on the same hand. However, Garnet is my birthstone and I know how dark red Garnet is to be. This maybe a series of garnet stones but they are very light in color. That is my main complaint. Other then that, the ring is beautiful. <end>  Great Price and Nice Stones  This was a great price and the quality of the stones and setting is very good. The ring is very light weight and the color of the stones is exactly as depicted in the picture. My only criticism is that there are too many stones spread out on the band and cut a bit into your pinky as the ring shifts around your finger. <end>  darling garnet ring  this ring really sparkles. for a very low price, i have a cute ring that looks teriffic <end>  Not the typical "garnet" color pictured, but a beautiful ring  Like another reviewer, the stones in the ring I received were more a rose pink color than the deep red you'd expect with a garnet. That said, they were well-matched to each other (all the same pink-y shade) and I love the ring. It gives the illusion of a eternity band, but the smooth/stoneless back band makes it more comfortable than if the stones went all the way around. I especially like the high profile of the settings. Looks like it cost far more than it does. <end>  Gorgeous, fits well, stones stay put  I got this to wear daily, and even with doing dishes, soap, etc, the ring has stayed looking great for over a month now. I highly recommend it. The garnets are a little light, but very pretty. <end>  Nice ring  This is a nice, petite, ring. Color is nice and pretty. Good value for the money. <end>  Dull  The quality and the stone setting were good, but the color was dull orange-red and not very easily visible against a tanned skin tone. Not worth it, if you are expecting a deeper rich colored garnet gemstone. <end>  Nice for the price!  To be honest, I got this on Amazon's 70% off Summer Blowout, so the price was under $10. It's a pretty ring, with stones that are a deep orangey-red. It's actually very pretty, just not the true or dark red I expected. The setting goes a bit too far on either side of the ring, which can make it a tad uncomfortable to wear, as the setting itself sits a high on the finger. This means it doesn't lie flat against your finger, which is just fine as long as the setting doesn't extend to the area between your fingers. I have relatively small fingers, so perhaps it would not be an issue for larger ring sizes. Overall, I'm happy with the ring, but it won't be getting quite the wear I thought it would due to the color and fit issues. <end>  Not bad for the price  It looks almost the same as the picture shows, but the color is really orange, not red. Not bad for the price I brought. <end>  A lovely garnet silver ring  Unlike other reviewers, I do feel the picture depicts the ring pretty well. The garnet appear lighter in day light while darker indoors. The ring body is shiny and smooth. I took off one star because the stone array is a bit too wide (I realized it's partly because I ordered a small size 5. Should work better on larger sizes) <end>  7-Stone Ring  A very pretty ring, although 7 stones across seems to be a little wide. But for the price, a great buy! <end>  nice red orange fire  The review i read before i bought this ring mentioned that these garnets are not deep red, which is true. Garnets range in types and colors, and these do have a really pretty brighter kind of red - it's hard to describe - not pink, not orange, not scarlet either. The sizing was true; I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. <end>  Garnet Ring  This ring is a very good value for the money. The garnets are paler than they appear in the picture, and the ring is very thin, but I am happy with it. I have received many compliments! <end>  I didn't like it.  The garnets are pink, not a deep red like I expected. I personally don't like it. Otherwise, it is a nicely made ring. Also, I am a size 5 and the 7 stones are just too much they hit the sides of my other fingers. <end>
 B000OZRDGK  Gemstone Globe Wine Bottle Stoppers -Set Of 3 ||	  Wine bottle stoppers  These were quite elegant and the perfect gift for true wine connoseur, who has everything. Thank you very much. <end>
 B000OZUQLO  Matte Silver Metal Business Card Holder ||	  Great!  I ended up spending a little more than I had originally intended to spend on a business card holder, purchasing this one after buying a cheaper, cheesier card holder (the bungee cord holder). I wish I'd bought this one first. It easily fits in a pocket, is attractive and of sturdy construction. Very happy with it! <end>  My Husband loved it!  I got this as a gift for my Husband and he loves it. He gets compliments from co-workers all the time about how sharp it looks. Fast shipping! <end>  sleek and stylish  This is a great present for someone in the office. I bought this for my office's secret santa, and my co-worker thought it was great. It looks super sleek and stylish. Harris Michael shipped it to me quickly and well packaged. <end>  Never again  This cheap thing lasted me less than a month. I remember taking it out during a business meeting and it was rusting, it was so embarrassing I threw the thing out. <end>  Este producto no es lo que aparenta!!!  Este porta tarjeta es demasiado caro para lo que vale, ya que su fabricacion es china. No es de plata esterlina ni nada parecido, simplemente es laton pulido. Yo pienso que su verdadero valor no deber rondar mas de 2 o 3 dolares americano. No aconsejo que inviertan su dinero en un porta-tarjeta que muy bien puede conseguirse por mucho menos. No hagan rico a sus vendedores por una baratija que no vale la pena. <end>  Highly Recommended  I waited two weeks for this to come in, but nothing. Something must have happened with the shipping. I emailed the company, and someone got back to me within 24 hours. They shipped a new one to me over night, and got to my house the next day! I was pleasantly surprised. The product is very slick looking, and easy to carry around. I have received multiple complements from friends/coworkers on the product. It may be a little pricey, but definitely cannot go wrong with it! <end>  Snazzy!  Bought one for me and one as a gift for my friend, and she likes it. I have gotten multiple compliments at work, and I'm very happy with it. A great case for business cards and an awesome gift. <end>

 B000P0NHA0  Edward Mirell Men's Grey and Black Titanium 9mm Plain Wedding Band, Size 10 ||	  9mm Grey & Black Titanium Wedding Band  It's a ring. Solid. Lightweight. Comfortable. What else more can you say about a ring. It does look very sharp - it doesn't look like or feel like it came from a gumball machine. Well worth the money. <end>
 B000P0NNU4  Edward Mirell Men's Black Titanium 8mm Plain Wedding Band, Size 12 ||	  Awsome!!!!!!!!  I got this for my fiance when we were going to get married... and now that he has gotten it he loves it. He loves how it was such quick service and such a great product... this truely is the perfect wedding ring... thank you! <end>  Good working mans ring  I recently got married and was looking for a good band for myself. I purchased this one and am very impressed. It feels good and is very light despite the size. it is comfortable and stands up to the rigors of the work of a mechanic. I have yet to scratch it. also, when it is washed with simple soap and water, the ring really shines. The only complaint I have about this ring is that dirt has a tendency to get trapped in the grooves and it cannot be re-sized (like all titanium bands). but if you can get over that, this is the best way to go for a work horse that looks classy <end>  Perfection  This ring is the perfect balance between beauty and sophistication. It looks exactly the way the picture shows. It is durable and still looks great. It is casual enough for every-day use, and looks great when he is all dressed up. <end>  Large Ring  I bought the ring because I thought that it looked good. When I got it, it was a little darker in color than what the picture showed. The size was also too big. The 8mm size was also too wide for my liking. My wife also did not like it and I returned it. Amazon was very accommodating and accepted the ring back and refunded my money. <end>  Sleek Looking  This is better than your average gold or silver band. The titanium still looks new after a year with no scratches. Its dressy looking without being to much. Its comfort fit band is nice. The only issue is that the edges on the black inside band is a little sharp. <end>  Awesome Wedding Band  I originally bought this ring for my hubby when we were getting married. A year and a half later we accidently lost it. My hubby loved this ring so I bought him the exact same one for our 2 year anniversary. He loves it and I love it - Its nice and durable and heavy, in a good way! <end>  Lovely  I got this ring as an anniversary gift. They loved it. It is a comfortable ring, and it isn't easily damaged. <end>  Nice ring, very striking  I ordered two of these rings and am very happy with both. I agree with previous reviewers that there are sharp edges on the ring, however I don't find them to be of any danger. I did, by accident, scratch the inside of a car window in a rental when I smacked a bug. Titanium is a strong metal and the ring is holding up well. I'm hard on my jewelry and so far, this one is standing the test. The ring sized a little larger than I had expected, and I did use a professional sizer to measure before ordering. Wear an 11 but ended up exchanging it for a 10. <end>  NIce but Dangerous  This is a nice ring. However, I work with someone who used to work in the Jewelry industry and the only company that has the rights to making black titanium is a company called Merrell. We got the ring a little later than expected, but still came the day before I needed it give it as a gift. Also, the ring itself is kind of sharp. Meaning the seems where the black and silver meet, is literally sharp. We thought we might cut our ringer on it. Overall, it's a pretty ring, but I prefer the real version of it. Not the one made in China. <end>  It's a Chinese knockoff - BEWARE  This ring is a ripoff of ring made here in the U.S. by Edward Mirell. It's absolutely identical, but not the real black titanium that Edward Mirell uses and that their parent corporation has the patent on. So beware - the black WILL come off pretty easily as it is only plated. It's a shame that Amazon sells knockoffs, and that Edward Mirell is powerless to stop them. <end>  Great looking, but overpriced for what it is  Titanium alloys are relatively CHEAP; they are certainly nowhere close to being considered even semi-precious as a base material. They're typically easy to machine and work with, which only compounds the problem I have with the pricing, even if the price of entry is far below that of gold or platinum.Yes titanium is durable. Yes titanium wears well. Yes titanium is hypo-allergenic. Yes it's cheaper than gold. But in the end it's still just titanium, a bloody well common metal in pure form and nearly equally just as so in all of its alloy forms. Considering how simple this band is, it's not much of a step away from costume jewelry, regardless of how stylish or spiffy it looks. An equal amount of this metal in an airplane wing would be equate to pennies; am I supposed to be impressed that some cheap labor (or even a machine or two) who knows where spitting these out by the thousands makes it worth a cool $100?I think not.(Evidently some of the sellers also think as me, since it's now $30 cheaper than it was four months ago when I first wrote this rant. But considering the prices of some of the other titanium bands here on Amazon, $70 is still on the steep side.) <end>  worst amazon service ever  In the past i have ordered so many items and amazon had always exceeded my expectations.For our anniversary, thought would order jewelery from amazon as we had liked their excellent service in the past (i looked for items from amazon store only under jewelry instead of amazon affiliates due to loyalty). The time estimate for this ring said 5 days, since i had 8 days to our anniversary, decided to buy.On purchase amazon sent an e-mail that its going to take 10 days, rigthaway I decided to cancel the order (as its few days out of my required date) and send a note to the customer service and they promptly replied back with a note that its already been shipped and can't cancel it.Now i was hopeful that it might arrive on time, but worst happened, it came as previously mentioned (11 days later). This is totally wacky, how in the world it could have been shipped and it took 10 days to arrive ? Even balance bar and stuff arrives within time where as key items that were promised to be delivered in 5 days can't be delivered ? I ended up screwing the anniversary and gave so many excuses not to have a gift (to my wife because of this) - i would never buy/recommend jewelry from amazon.The story is not over, they had shipped wrong size of this ring to me, so i decided to return it. There we go, the second saga of my experience, they received it and rejected it and sent back the ring (actually they rejected it on my second ring). Unbelievable worst experience from amazon.I usually don't write reviews or feedback, am writing this so people like me can at least think twice before they buy jewelry from amazon. If you're buying any jewelry, please go to a reputed store (online i had wonderful experience with other top 2 merchants along with returns). wouldn't recommend amazon, unless you have time and energy to test these folks (not worthy risking the occasion). <end>  Wonderful Ring  During hunting season, my husband lost his wedding ring. We purchased it when we got married five years ago, and he was devastated to lose it. We didn't have $400 to buy another one, so I started looking aound for a ring that he would like and that would stand up to factory work. This ring is absolutely beautiful and weighs very little, which he enjoys. I can't speak yet for how well it'll stand up, but it's been a few weeks and so far it's looking good!**EDITED TO ADD** It's been almost a year later and the ring still looks great. It needs a slight polishing (he works at a manufacturing plant), but so far it's held up absolutely beautifully. I am very happy I ordered this ring! <end>  8mm Black Titanium wedding band  Product was as described, I am very pleased. Hasn't been used long enough, yet, to judge the wearablity quality. But appearance is fantastic, the prettieest mens wedding band I have ever seen. <end>  Wonderful!  Even with free shipping this ring was delivered in two days! It looks exactly as it does in the picture, I'm very happy with this product. I think it's a great choice for someone who wants to give their man a handsome and sophisticated ring. <end>  Great Ring - Wrong Size  Bought this ring as a wedding band in a size 10, it was really nice and looked even better than the picture, but when we compared the ring we got to the size chart it was more like a 12. Since they don't make it in a small enough size, I'll be returning it. Thought people might like to know that the sizes run big since no one has mentioned that yet. <end>  cheaply made and overpriced, but still looks cool...?  I'm a bit on the fence about it. On the one hand it looks pretty cool and the black fits my personal style well. On the other hand, that black scratches off way too easy! After only a month, I noticed a couple scratches where the black was scratched off. After a couple months, there are many scratches. For the price, I did not expect to have the black scratch off like this. Maybe I am too rough? If the black scratches completely off, I will have to get another ring. It's a bit disappointing. <end>  Holds up well!!!  My husband works for pepsi, so he's in and out bustling with a "2 wheeler" like a dollie i guess and picking up crates. So it has seen its work...It still looks lovely on his finger...Money well spent <end>  Almost Perfect  My husband LOVES this ring. Everyone compliments him and he's happy to have a non-traditional ring. Plus, his entire wardrobe is black so it matches perfectly.One con Where the black meets the titanium, it's a tiny bit rough and scratches a little if you touch there. <end>  Worth every penny  I gave this ring to my fianc&eacute; for our anniversary and he absolutely loved it. His own mother fell in love with the ring and was trying it on every finger to see if it would fit, not that she would really take it from him lol. He receives compliments on it everyday. When I received the ring I myself was happy with the quality of the ring considering the price is so cheap. People think I spent a bundle on it. My fianc&eacute; is a carpenter and this ring is very durable that is why I was looking for a ring that would last him and not scratch up so easily. This ring looks gorgeous on his finger that I can't even stop looking at his hand lol. I'm very happy with my purchase. <end>  Great ring!  I loved this ring because it was different, he loved it because it is lighter than gold and durable. <end>  Fantastic Ring for any man  I bought this for my future Husband, and he loves this ring. With my man being an eternal skeptic, I was so happy when he embraced this ring, as the "important" ring, to wear at all times.......... <end>
 B000P0P6J0  Firefighter Helmet & Axes Charm 14k Gold 13mm ||	  You get what you pay for  I should've known better. This is a VERY small cheesey little pendant that I couldn't give my GF (as a gift) because it was so rediculously small. I should've paid better attention to the description. Maybe I'll give it to my daughter when she graguates high school. <end>
 B000P0QV94  Sea Turtle Charm 14k Gold 13mm ||	  Too Small  Waaay too small for my charm bracelet. Seems too small for a necklace unless you are looking for delicate. Returned the item. Guess I'll need to wait for gold prices to come down ) <end>
 B000P0QW5M  Hawaii & Leaves Charm 14k Gold 8mm ||	  Hawaii charm review  Product is nice,unfortunately it is much smaller than I expected. Quality of the charm is good, but with it being so small it is difficult to see it or appreciate the quality. <end>
 B000P0TYZM  14k Yellow Gold Oval Pave Diamond Hoop Earrings (3/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I2 Clarity) ||	  "One chip off from perfect"  Ordered for my wife and gave to her for our anniversary. She likes them but one diamond chip was missing. Amazon indicated you had no more available and offered a 'return'. Elected to keep and had a local jewler replace the chip. Similar earrings in local stores were three to ten times the price so I cannot complain. I think the 'fix' only cost about $20. <end>
 B000P0VRB6  10k White Gold Round Pave Diamond Hoop Earrings (1/2 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Too small for me  Although I bought these earrings at an unbelivable low price--they were way to small for me. In the picture they look wider than they actually are. They are just a tad bigger than huggies and not as wide, so I sent them back. If you like prettty small earrings--these will be perfect for you. They shined very nicely. <end>
 B000P0WWH4  Mood Ring Band (Sold Individually - Styles Vary) ||	  What you would expect for the price  I bought this ring for my granddaughter. The description was very vague. I now know why. The size is not adjustable, but no size was requested when I ordered it. The ring does change colors, but did not come with a chart to let you know what the colors mean. All in all, it is what you would expect for the price. But, after I bought it, I found one at a convenience store for $1.99 that was just as good. <end>  Good quality product.  I bought a couple of these rings just for fun and was pleasantly surprised to find that they weren't just cheap quality toys. Very happy. <end>  Fun, inexpensive mood ring  I bought this ring for my son, and it's about what you'd expect for the price--just a fun, inexpensive mood ring. I do wish the size (adult) had been mentioned in the review. It's way too big for a child. <end>  Suuuuuuuuuuuuks  The plastic brakes after a week so don't get it it's not worth your money no wonder its cheap # lame <end>  Great Retro Fun!  Mood rings are still fun even today! They're an especially great gift for any kid who has never had one. Put on the ring and see what mood you're really feeling! <end>  This ring stinks!!!  When i bought this for my son i didnt know that it would be that huge and when he put it on it stayed black and never changed so please dont buy this you will be disappointed!!!!! <end>  this is a rip of  i expeted this thing to acually work and be some fun for my daughter but it didnt even change colers. Then i found one that acually worked at a fair for $1.89 <end>
 B000P0ZKRS  10k White Gold Channel-Set Diamond Hoop Earrings (1 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Diamond Hoops  Excellent quality and price. These earrings were a gift for my mother and she loves them. The diamonds are easily visible and we did not notice any carbon markings within the stones -- the stones were surprisingly very clear -- I think I got lucky with this set!! I compared the price and diamond clarity with other online jewelers and feel confident that I made the right decision to purchase them from Amazon. <end>  Simple and elegant  I actually ended up buying these earrings twice. The first time I thought that they were a little too simple for what I was looking for at the time--so I returned them. I kept looking at other earrings without any luck. What I wanted was a pair of earrings to wear everyday, but I wanted them with some diamonds, white gold, and not too big. The next time that these earrings were on offer (during Diamond month) I bought them again and now I wear them all the time. The gold is heavy, the diamonds are a nice size (althought they don't shine very much). The earrings look elegant and simple, and are comfortable, perfect for everyday wear. <end>
 B000P24EDC  Double Sided Heart Shaped LIVE, LOVE, LAUGH & Round FAITH, HOPE, LOVE Sterling Silver Affirmation Band Pendant Necklace on Brown Satin Cord, 15" - 17" in Length, #9797 ||	  Well done  This is a lightweight, attractive, quality necklace that can be worn everyday. The message is timeless. This jewelry is for all ages. <end>  I like it!  I ended up asking to trade the brown cord for a silver ball chain (which they were very nice about doing), but I really like the necklace! <end>  Nice gift for spiritual person  Purchased this gift to convey my love to my daughter and granddaughter. Sent it to myself first, to check it over. Very nice. Good quality. I think they will enjoy it for years to come. Jean M. Eno <end>
 B000P24JL4  Necklace / Pendant - N75 - Murano Glass Style - Round Shape ~ Purple & Yellow ||	  Good purchase  This piece is a great bargain as it is quite beautiful. I have only worn it a few times and don't know how long the satin will hold up. However, that is an easy fix and for the price you can't go wrong. <end>
 B000P39Q2U  PalmBeach Jewelry Sterling Silver Hammered-Style Cigar Ring ||	  Substantial!  My sister picked this out for me to order. It looks so much better in person!

 B000P3XNMY  Men's 14k Yellow Gold 6mm Engraved Plain Wedding Band, Size 9.5 ||	  Wonderful fit.. very comfortable  I needed to replace my band. Much to my dismay, it really wasn't worth resizing. Let me fill you in a little. My wife and I decided to get married and decided to avoid the stress. Along with other quickie steps, we got our bands at the local Wal-Mart. Now, my band no longer fits we decided to get the band I should have. My first stop was Amazon and I found this one. This is a nice solid ring, soft edges and fits comfortable. My orignial band dug into my finger and felt thin and cheap (because it was). This ring was worth every dollar. Knowing now, I would have spent the original retail price. as far as looks, the pic does no justice. It's a rich buttery gold look and the etching gives the look of a gold dust finish. And most importiently, it does not look like the mass produced rings at the mall jewelers. <end>

 B000P4PWXG  14k Yellow Gold Round Blue Diamond Stud Earrings (3/8 cttw) ||	  Blue Diamond Studs  I love a good bargain! What I received in the mail was just like the on-line picture and the price of the earrings was reasonable. Again, I wish Amazon offered more colored diamond stud earrings and related items in a larger variety of carat sizes, colors and cuts. It would have been nice to be able to buy a matching smaller carat size pair to wear together and a pendent. Colored diamond jewelry is gaining in popularity and more department stores are beginning to sell it. <end>  Pretty Diamonds, but Smaller than Picture  I think that is a great diamonds and a great gift for your mother or wife, or whatever. The unique thing I have to say is the diamonds are so smaller than appears in the picture. The size of the diamonds is like the head of a hard drive cover screw, or a little bit more.However I think the price is good for this item and I am very satisfied with them. <end>
 B000P4PWYA  14k Yellow Gold Princess-Cut Blue Diamond Stud Earrings (3/8 cttw) ||	  Blue Diamonds  These diamonds are very nice. They are a little smaller than I had envisioned, but they are very pretty. Will go perfect with the evening dress I just purchased. <end>

 B000P4XGY8  10k White Gold Created Gemstone and Diamond Earrings (0.02 cttw, H-I Color, I2-I3 Clarity) ||	  Dissapointed  I got these in and they looked like fake jewelry. I wish I had chosen else, a lesson learned for future purchases. <end>  Lovely earrings  Beautiful earrings looks quite stunning. In hindsight will not chose white gold as I find this material very soft so bends easily (which has happened to the back of this one too). <end>  The wife loved 'em!  Very nice earrings that the wife adores. A very good price for me. In spite of a major winter storm, they still came before Christmas! <end>  good gift  it is a great product for that very special person. they say good things comes in small packages...well this exemplifies that. <end>  The post on one of the earrings broke off the first time I  The post on one of the earrings broke off, causing the earring to fall off. I could only find the back with the post in it, but not the earring! Its the first time I ever wore it, now its gone! I will NEVER buy jewelry from Amazon again. Over one hundred dollars lost! Thanks! <end>  saphire/diamond earrings  They are Beautiful, and light weight! I don't even feel them.I got many compliments.I reccommend you buy them for you or someone who likes feather weight earrings.I love them! <end>  Earrings are gorgeous, backs and packaging bad.  The earrings came in a cheap looking blue cardboard box and a tiny black pouch made out of crummy velveteen.They were gorgeous, and I absolutely adored them... until the back fell off of one and I had to trek back through O'Hare airport to find it on my previous plane over the holiday. I replaced the back with a different one, and thanked my lucky stars...Vacation came and went, I went back to work and lo and behold, the same thing happened with the other earring; of which I hadn't replaced the original back. This time I wasn't so fortunate- and I haven't found the earring.My advice, replace the backs before use. If giving as a gift, also repackage. <end>  Beautiful earrings, but way too small  ...These earrings are very beautiful, but too small for an adult--they are child-size. The briolette is the size of a teardrop! I returned them for this reason. (Amazon  you should consider posting an actual-size photo for all jewelry.) <end>  Perfect, except for the backs  These are beautiful! Just the right size, very elegant and lightweight. As another reviewerd commented, the backs do not stay on very well. I replaced them immediately with my own rubber backs.They have just the right amount of dangle, and are not too long or too short. <end>  Elegant  I received these earrings as a gift. They are the perfect size and weight. They aren't huge and gaudy but very elegant. I wore them to the theater last night and received several compliments. <end>  Beautiful earrings--my wife loves them!  I just bought these earrings for my wife and she absolutely loves them. They are pretty and substantial looking. The stones have excellent color and are definitely quality. Yes, I know they are "lab created", but lab created sapphires are sapphires nonetheless---not simulated stones or colored cz's. They match nicely with the natural sapphire ring I bought for as a push present for $2k. As other people have noted these earrings have friction backs that could become loose. You may want to buy more secure backs or have a jeweler put on a screw back if you're really concerned about it. For those of you who complain that these earrings are too small--I beg to differ. They are not small at all... they are nicely sized. They are classy looking, not gaudy behemoths. Frankly, if they were any larger, they would most surely give themselves away as lab created and not natural. The packaging on these earrings was also very nice, not tiffany's nice, but showed off the earrings well. I think you're special someone will be pleased with these earrings. <end>  Check size  These earrings are just a bit smaller than I expected but they are very exquisite and elegant. Probably this size will allow me to wear them more frequently. Good package and fast way of shipment. <end>  saphir  You will be shocked with the real size, which is much less than on the picture! <end>  Love them!  I bought these earrings and the matching necklace to wear for my unconventional wedding, in which I'll be wearing blue. They are absolutely perfect - very sparkly and I agree with the other reviewers - elegant. Also, they were exactly the size I expected them to be. The photograph on here is magnified and the size is listed in the description. <end>  Wife loved them  Bought these while deployed from Iraq. Wife loved them. They where a wonderful Christmas gift. <end>
 B000P4XWPG  14k Gold Semi-Precious and Diamond Tennis Bracelet, 7.25" ||	  Bought for Valentines day, and it was a hit!  My girlfriend loves diamonds and pearls (has quite a few of both, and very nice pieces at that). I looked through for something to get her for Valentine's day (2007) and of all the items on Amazon this struck my fancy. It's not her usual fair (white gold, lots of diamonds, old-fasioned pearls, etc) but I just thought it looked very pretty and young/playful. I took a risk and got her this.She loved it right when she first got it. She said it looked to be of decent quality (important, since you can't tell from a picture), and has commented several times on how sparkly the topaz are. She is not a fan of cubic-zirconia (too sparkly and fake) and loves diamonds (very sparkly). So this is a good thing. The blue was also a good color. I don't know if it matches the picture well, only that she liked it.The diamonds are tiny and almost not worth it. I'm not too worried about that, as they add a little bit and are not the focus. Mainly I thought it to be a well balanced and colorful bracelet.Definitely recommended. <end>  Great Value!  I was very pleased with the Amethyst Bracelet. The color of the stones was excellent and I thought that the value for money was exceptional. <end>  Lovely bracelet at a great price!  I bought this as a birthday gift for the wife, and she loved it! The stones are all nicely cut, and the amethysts are very clear and well colored. <end>  Beautiful  It's very beautiful. I bought this bracelet for my wife. Stones shine very well. Brilliants are small, but look very well in the item. <end>  It broke  (  I am writing this on my bf account he bought me the bracelet... Sadly enough I think I got a lemon it broke after 3 hours of wearing it on x-mas we decided to send it back and I am in the process of choosing something else... I was sad it broke the links are not very strudy! <end>  Beautiful Bracelet  My 19 year old daughter lost her diamond tennis bracelet and broke her amythest one. I came up with the idea to get her both in one this time and at a fraction of the cost. This is a beautiful bracelet. The purple amythests are deep in color and the diamonds although tiny sparkle beautifully. The only problem is , it will need to be made smalleras my daughter has a tiny wrist. Not a big problem <end>  Gorgeous bracelet  Gave this to my wife for Christmas and she adores it. Nice stones and sturdy clasp <end>  sparkling  My wife loves the elegance of the bracelet. The blue stones blend beautifully with the white gold and sparkling diamond specks. <end>  Simply a Beautiful, Elegant Bracelet  The picture provided by amazon is actually quite accurate. This bracelet is sturdy, well constructed yet light-weight. Each blue topaz is even colored and sparkles well under the light, along with the tiny diamonds. The overall design is simple and elegant. My girlfriend commented how exquisite it looks. This is a beautiful bracelet and I am very happy with the purchase. <end>  wonderful  I absolutely love my braclet. I will enjoy wearing it. My daughter helped me to buy it. <end>  So pretty!  Super fast! I placed my order yesterday(two-day shipment) and got it today!It's so pretty. I love it!!! <end>  Mine broke on the first day  My husband gave me this bracelet as a birthday/christmas gift (My birthday is Christmas Eve). I put it on immediately and later that day it broke. The bracelet broke a few links away from the clasp. After reading other reviews of their bracelet breaking, we decided to return it. Its beautiful, but if you wear it, it might break. I'm really disappointed because husband never really chooses jewelry for me and when he finally does, it breaks. <end>  Terrible---But not anymore.  I got this as a first anniversary gift for my wife. The second time she wore it, a week after receiving it, the bracelet broke, fell off her wrist and is now lost. I will be contacting Amazon about the quality of this jewelry; hopefully the quality of their customer service is better than their jewelry. I will keep you informed.-- UPDATE---Their customer service was fantastic. I feel bad that it took me so long to update my rating. highly RECOMMEND. <end>  Broken bracelet  Product was returned. The bracelet broke after a few days of wearing it. Good looking bracelet but no durable. Would not suggest purchasing this item. <end>  great item  This item was more attractive than I thought it might be when I ordered it. My wife loved it and it goes well with the other items I ordered for her. <end>  Beautiful bracelet  Wife loved it. Bought it for her as Christmas gift. Risky buying such an expensive jewelry item online but previous reviews convinced me and I wasn't disappointed. Neither was she. <end>  Broke after 2 weeks  It is a very pretty bracelet, but it broke after 2 weeks. I was lucky enough not to lose it and returned it. <end>  Love it!  My husband gave me this for our 25th wedding aniversary, and to go with some other pieces I have, and I love it. The blue color is almost hypnotic, and the tiny dimonds make for just the right amount of sparkle. I'm getting lots of compliments everywhere I wear it. <end>  very nice quality for the money  I got this for my fiance for christmas. Overall, I am very pleased with it. The garnets are very nice, very good quality. The diamonds are small, as you would expect, but the setting for the diamonds make them seem very much larger. I would expect to pay, realistically, around an actual $350-450 for this in a jewelry store, so it was a great value for the money. I would buy this again for her in a second. Also, the box that it came in was very gorgeous, and helped make this gift even nicer. <end>  14k garnet/diamond bracelet  I am so excited to get this bracelet,many garnets tend to be more than I can afford, I think it's beautiful, the price is great, which I am surprised. I can't wait to get it! I can't say enough about it! <end>  I Love It  I bought this for my wife. She was very happy when it arrived, it is a very pretty bracelet. It seems very delicate but she has worn it many times with no problems. So far so good. <end>  Incredible Item!  I bought this for my mothers 60th birthday and she loved it! It was EXACTLY as pictured. I almost never but jewlery online since you truly can't tell what you're getting but I was more that pleased with this! <end>  Gorgeous Bracelet  I received an email on Black Friday and was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful jewelry you offered. In the past I mostly bought books and dvds. This bracelet was a gift for my mother's birthday and she couldn't take her eyes off of it. <end>
 B000P4YHNM  18k Yellow Gold Overlay Sterling Silver Ruby and Diamond Accent Hoop Earrings ||	  beautiful earrings  These earrings are as beautiful in my ears as they appear on this site. The setting is just perfect. I cannot say enough good about them; they are classy looking. <end>  Nice  These are very nice, but are alittle heavy.

 B000P53PGQ  14k Yellow Gold Amethyst Rope Trimmed Pendant, 18" ||	  Just Don't  Give it to your wife/girlfriend, and then just forget about anything while she tries to untangle it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Really, back here in 10 minutes. She's still working on it. It came in a little sack and is a jumbled mess. Read the other review. It's little.You'd be nuts to order this. Wish I could give it -6. Glad I didn't wait till Christmas.Well, it's another half-hour. She's still at it, and won't let me send it back. My first apprehensive shot at ordering jewelry from Amazon, I will never again.This just in  back it all goes!! What a waste. <end>  Delicate but Vibrant  The color of the stone and gold is vibrant. This is a delicate item; the chain is light and the clasp is small so you must handle with care. A nice item for a young girl or even an older woman who likes gemstones. Nice change if you generally wear bold and funky jewelry. I have enjoyed the necklace and earring set for almost a year and handle it gently. <end>  nice but small  This is a nice piece but remember it is smaller compared to how it looks on the website. <end>  cute and dainty  This is a brilliant purple colored Amethyst necklace. It is cute and dainty. I like the gold design around it. It is simple yet elegant. <end>
 B000P53PI4  14k Yellow Gold Smoky-Quartz 3-Stone Ring, Size 7 ||	  Beautiful ring  I received this ring as an anniversary present and love it. I wear a lot of animal prints and brown and the smoky-quartz looks great. Really love the 3-stone shapes which are different and the cut is beautiful. This ring gets a lot of compliments! <end>  Ring in New Year with this!  Love it!! Been looking for smoky topaz unsuccessfully for awhile,,,,this is just what I wanted! Really beautiful ring, perfect fit. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I've had several Smokey Quartz rings over the years and this one was big enough to be noticable but not overpowering. Very high quality and great color...a lot of these stones tend to be too light, but this one is beautiful and dark. I feel like a spent a lot more money. Great investment! <end>  MIDWEST GRANDMA  BOUGHT RING FOR DAUGHTER FOR XMAS. MISPLACED AND BOUGHT THIS ONE. LIKED IT SO MUCH BETTER!! NICE QUALITY FOR THE PRICE AND VERY ELEGANT LOOKING. NOT TOO GAUDY BUT GOOD FOR EVERYDAY RIGHT HAND ETC. <end>  Impressive  This is a large ring and will be perfect in the winter months when I often wear browns. The yellow gold and brown tones are so warm and perfectly suited with one another. I would definitely recommend this ring to anyone who dares to wear a bold piece. <end>  exquisite ring LOVE IT  I am a very modern person who still like to see the influence of classical or traditional or heirloom styles in jewelry. This ring is timelessly elegant and even more stunning in real life. I had to have it sized smaller to a 5 1/2, but its gorgeous and totally worth it. I can wear it anywhere as the stone is dressy but subtle enough for daytime too. And the smoky quartz make me feel unique... its not something everyone else has.... I love it!! <end>  I knew I had a winner...  &#34;Oooh!&#34; she said, looking at the picture of this 14k Yellow Gold Smoky-Quartz ring, featured in Amazon's curated jewelry collection. Her eyes widened with excitement.I knew I had just found her birthday present, and the price wasn't bad at all.A few minutes later, it was ordered and on its way, along with a matching set of 14k Yellow Gold Emerald-Cut Smoky-Quartz Stud Earrings, also from Amazon's Curated Collection.The jewelry arrived quickly and safely just a few days later. Opening the box, the ring looked perfect - all gold and shiny and quartz-y. It somehow looked smaller than it did in the pictures online, but apparently that was due to having no frame of reference in the photos, since it looks just fine on her finger.And she agrees.Well worth the money I paid. Thanks, Amazon! <end>  I didn't like it.  It is pretty but not for me. It didn't do anything for me when I put it on. I returned it. <end>  Gorgeous Ring  This ring is absolutely beautiful. The stone is big enough to be noticed yet not so big that it is gaudy. Very classic and elegant. It is just what I have been looking for! <end>  Pretty ring  This ring is very pretty and well made. The stone is sizable but since it is brown it isn't too gaudy, and the shape elongates your fingers. It was also a great deal for the price! <end>  Love, love, love this  Was so happy when this came in. It matches the earrings I ordered. I like the emerald cut very much. <end>  Amazing ring  First i saw this ring , It was love on first side. I bought this ring for my mom's birthday,and she love it. It matches with everything and is perfect size. <end>
 B000P548AS  18k Yellow Gold Plated Sterling Silver Ruby Flower Dangle Earrings ||	  much lighter pink than pic  I was really disappointed with the color of the "ruby" stones! I knew they would be a little light for this price, but the ones I received look more like Pink Tourmaline than rubies!! Very disappointed... <end>  Pretty but not as expected  I bought this earing to gift it to my Sister-in-law... Its cute but it doest sparkle as shown in the picture..In the picture the stone s are very dark in color but the one i got is not as bright as i expected to be... The design is nice.. <end>  Cute, tiny.  Cute, quite tiny, though. Also the ruby is rather opaque  expected for the price, but the ruby in the picture looks better than the actual product. Still, good value for the price. <end>  Really cute and beautiful pair of earrings  Just love these earrings. They are so delicate and pretty. They are tiny but still big enough to be seen. I dont like big, heavy earrings so these are perfect for me. They are well secured so dont have to worry about losing them. <end>  my favorite earrings  These are very dainty and pretty. They are definitely pink, not red. I wear them all the time. If you like dainty things these are adorable and you can't beat them. <end>  Beautiful  Bought it for my cousins daughter who is 5 years old... I simply loved it.. Due to reviews I thought it would be so small that it would be invisible to eyes but its really good size... NICE deal... <end>  pretty earrings  I think these earrings are pretty. As others have mentioned the stones are not red but more of a pink in color. But, that is fine with me.Added 12/27/2011  Just wanted to pop in to add that after almost a year-and-a-half these are still one of my favorite pairs of earings. <end>  Beautiful  I bought them for my 8 year old daughter. They are beautiful and have had no trouble with them at all. <end>  Great earrings  These are so light you can hardly tell they're in and I get lots of compliments when I wear them. Very cute! The only downside is one of mine has an area where they were poorly put together and it tends to pinch me when I put it in. Once in, I really like them! <end>  Small but beautiful  I read many of the reviews and one person mentioned getting them for her niece. I thought great idea, I"ll get them for my granddaughter. She loves pink and so many people mentioned they were more pink than red. Mine are definately red but are really beautiful earrings. Very dainty. <end>  My new favorites  Ruby is my birthstone. I've never had real rubies but always wanted some, so I took a chance on the one 5-star review that was already posted, as well as the bargain price. I'm so glad I did. These earrings are simply beautiful. They are tiny (be sure to check out the measurements listed), but you have to expect that for precious gems at this low price. They are still big enough to be seen and admired--I would call them a delicate size. They are subtly beautiful and perfect for my style, which is not flashy, garish, or look-at-me. As the description states, they are opaque, PINK-RED stones. The hinged lever-back clasps are sturdy and tight. I love the color--it's not quite fuchsia or magenta, but note that they are NOT PRIMARY RED. I'm using a Dell monitor, and the color is reproduced exactly on it. The center diamonds (diamond "chips" I believe) are minuscule but still add sparkle--the entire setting sparkles delightfully under incandescent lighting. <end>  So pretty!  These are delicate and beautiful. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but the colors are so rich and they're very wearable... I can not wait to show these off! <end>  My Daughter's First On-Line Purchase  My daughter wanted to get a great gift for her best friend's 14th birthday. She had limited funds, but wanted ruby and gold earrings. We went to all of the department stores and everything was more than ninety dollars. With little expectation we went on-line to Amazon.com and did a quick "Ruby Earring" search. These earrings were on the first page of results and my daughter was in love with them. They were perfect and completely affordable. As a matter of fact, there were so affordable that she bought two pair-one for her friend and one for herself. I was skeptical at the price and did not expect a quality product for such a low cost. The order came a day earlier than promised and they were not only beautiful and of good construction, but they also had gem information and care instructions to boot. My skepticism was gone. Thank you for a great experience! <end>  Absolutely terrible  I would NOT recommend anyone to buy this item. It tarnishes way too easily. The gold plating is a joke. I would give it a 0 star if I could. I bought these in Sep 2009. The jewelry turned black within a matter of 13 months. I had spent close to $165 buying the complete set - bracelet, necklace and earrings as a wedding gift. To my embarrassment the bride returned the jewelry back to me indicating that this set had already tarnished in Oct 2010. If it is $5 item then I am okay with the item tarnishing within a year or two. However at this price point an 18K gold plated item better hold up. I contacted Amazon but they only have a 30 day return policy. So long story short stay away from it. I would like to know the feedback from all the folks who gave positive feedback on this item within 30 day of purchase. How is it holding up? I am uploading some pictures so that you can judge it for yourself!!!Note  I would advise you to look at jewelry made by RISIS - Singapore. Not a single black mark after 18 years and I paid $35 for the real orchids (plated with 24K gold) earring set. <end>  Tarnishes in just 5 months!!  Would you imagine that the workmanship could be so poor that it the gold plating wears off in just 5 months? Well this pair of earrings have already tarnished and are un-wearable. They have been carefully placed in their original container and have never been worn. I purchased this item as a gift and am yet to present it to whom it was intended for. It seems like I'll have to toss it away.On calling Amazon today they were good enough to provide some promotional credit but they could not accept a return18k Yellow Gold Plated Sterling Silver Ruby Flower Dangle Earrings <end>  Poor Quality  I purchased these for my granddaughter's 9th birthday on July 29th. I opened the package and I thought this is exactly what I wanted. Closed them up and put them away. BUT when I opened them up to wrap them for the party they were all tarnished. Now, it's too late for me to return them. I'M NOT HAPPY!!!!! <end>  Beautiful earrings but a little undurable  These earrings are very beautiful. I got them from my mom on Christmas, and wore them for a while, and they were fine.But only for a while. Unfortunately for me, a tiny curved band that made the earrings snap close, broke. So now I can't wear them because the earrings might just fall off at any random time. I'm so sad!  '( If you are very active, u probably shouldn't buy this. <end>  Pretty but didn't hold up...  I really liked these earrings, but both were lost when the leverbacks stopped locking in place after just a couple months of use. <end>  Very danty....very cute!!!  I love this earrings. It's adorable and looks beautiful on my 6yrs old daughter. It's very well secured and I don't have to worry about loosing one of them. It's not that cheesy thin wired earrings that Amazon sells at times. It's very well made. I am completely satisfied. <end>  Leverback earrings  These earrings are very pretty but the flower is small and the plating did not hold up very long. It is now black on the back connection and difficult to clean. <end>  women's jewelry review  I actually bought these for my mother as a Christmas gift.As far as I know,she loved them.They seemed to be a high quality piece of jewelry. <end>  Dainty & Petite  This little pair of earrings are so dainty and petite... just the way I like them. <end>  no complaints  I gave this to my mom as a gift, and she said that she really liked it. My baby niece was quite attracted to it as well. <end>  disappointing  When I saw the discription (RUBY), I assumed red...and the stones are actually PINK. Don't need or want pink earrings...need dark red. Also, very tiny, not worth the cost. <end>  Satisfecho por la compra - Satisfied with the purchase  El producto lleg&oacute; en las condiciones estipuladas por el vendedor, estoy muy satisfecho con la compra.The product arrived in the conditions set by the seller, I am very satisfied with the purchase. <end>  They're ok  These earrings are cute if you're a teenager, but they're really not so great for a mature woman like me. I will keep these and give as a Christmas or birthday present for a younger relative. <end>  Bling  They are as advertised but are dissappointedly quite dainty (small). I would have still bought them but a photo with a reference like a dime would have eliminated over expectations. <end>  pretty earings  Great product, would recommend for older children or adults. Good fittings to earings and no reaction to sensitive ears. Great. <end>  Too small to see!  I was so disappointed with these earrings that I am returning them. I always figure that the picture has been enlarged, but these are miniscule! You can't even tell what the design is. <end>  Ruby flower earrings  I wanted something pink and delicate. This is just perfect. Lovely rubies. Small and delicate. Very comfortable too. Thank you. <end>  ruby flower earrings  They are easy to put in your ears and look great with casual or going out for an evening. I have gotten many comments on how nice they look and the design of the flower. <end>  Ruby leverback earrings  Simple, classic style. Very lightweight and easy leverback style makes it secure. Great price for 18k gold jewelry. I have purchased this product two times. <end>  Love It!  I was eyeing this earing for quite sometime...and I ordered it...came in a little box..and Oh it was the cutest earings ever! however you might want to note that in the picture the stones look red..but it's actually a little lighter..slightly on the pinkish side..but they are so beautiful! i am wearing them almost every day now! ) <end>  Good fit for my 2 year old daughter  I was looking for small and beautiful earrings for my 2 year old daughter. She is looking really cute with these earrings. Only problem I have is, one earring's connection is loose and sometimes it comes out. <end>  Cute Earrings  Bought these for my daughter since she is a July girl. She loves them! She is in her 20's so these are great for any age. <end>  Cute  I'm pleased with these cute little earrings. They are smaller than I expected, but jewelry usually is when purchased on-line. I've worn them at least 6x and the quality is good and no tarnishing or discoloring. <end>  beautiful delicate earrings  I love the earrings. I think they are well worth the price. They are small and delicate but that is what I love about them. I don't like big, heavy earrings. The earrings I received are a red color. I think they are perfect. <end>  Dainty, small but good deal  These earrings are exactly as the picture depict - they're small flowers which look dainty but nice. The product is great for the price and makes a nice gift or to wear for yourself. <end>  Very Pretty Mini Poinsettias  These earrings are very pretty. I am very pleased with the size (they are not overly big and dangle nicely) A nice addition to any little girl's start up jewelry box <end>  Happy  I bought these ear rings as an exchange for a book I received as a gift. Much prefere these ear rings and really enjoy wearing them. They are light and dangly and easy to wear.Very happy I bought them. <end>  Nice and Sweet  I really like these earrings and was delighted when I opened the box to see them. They are comfortable.Pros Color and gemstoneGoldCons Smaller than I expected but nice just the same <end>  love them !  they are sweet and expensive looking...was suprised by the quality...good for young lady or mature mom <end>  Pink not ruby red  A little disappointed, the stone is not as bright and dark as it appears on the website. The pair that I received has more of a pink colour than a ruby red. Considering the price, I guess it's worth it. Overall, it has a pretty design. I gave it to my niece as a birthday gift. <end>  Beautiful but too small  Got them for my wife. They are beautiful and well constructed but the ruby flower is very very small. Even with good eyes you have to focus a lot to see the flower in detail. Though before purchasing and after reading reviews at amazon, i was already mentally prepared that they'll be small... But they are toooo small. If the manufacturer can increase the size of the ruby flower, they can be a big hit.Overall they are still being liked as the design and construction is very good. Good Product. <end>  Beautiful, delicate earrings.  Very beautiful color, delicate earrings that compliment other jewelry without overwhelming nor loosing their standout quality. Great for any age. <end>  Love it  Loved the look and workmanship and the comfort of wearing it would recommend it to other family members and friends <end>

The friend I bought it for said she loves it except it gets caught on her pants when she sits but it'll be perfect for the summer time!  ) <end>  i love it  this is really cute, the only bad thing is that sometimes a bone will catch on a loose thread on my clothing, but that's to be expected. <end>

 B000P57PSA  Sterling Silver Celtic Design Square Pendant, 18" ||	  Great value!  I love this necklace. I was pretty impressed with the quality for the price. I hate buying jewelery online, but this one really was worth it! And it looks great on! <end>  Cute!  I am very happy with the pendant, however I feel the chain is sorta filmsy. <end>  sterling silver celtic design square pendant  This looks nothing like the picture. There is a big stamp on the back that says "made in china" Dull in color, very questionable if it is actually sterling silver. <end>  Pleasantly surprised  I purchased this necklace as a birthday gift for my niece and was a little skeptical, not knowing what it really looked like. Well, to my surprise it was beautiful. The quality and workmanship were better than I expected. <end>  Very pretty  I asked DH to buy these for me for Christmas along with a matching pair of earrings. Both are very nice. I took a star off because the chain was tangled badly when I opened it, it was just loose in the bag. The chain is pretty flimsy but I was already planning to use a longer chain for it than the 18" chain. The pendant itself is nice, and the velvet pouches and outer boxes are nice presentation. <end>  It should not be mandatory to write a product review  It should not be mandatory to write a product review It should not be mandatory to write a product review It should not be mandatory to write a product review <end>  Smaller than I had thought, yet very attractive.  Delicate and unassuming, yet classic, this pendant is versatile and will complement any outfit. It looks best against a solid color top. <end>  Good  Good, I like it, looks nice and charm, useful in everyday life, is not heavy I recommended it to all. <end>  Celtic Pendant  This is a nice necklace/pendant for the price, and easy to wear with many necklines. I bought the matching earrings and they look good together. <end>  Not great quality  I was expecting a good quality product for the amount of money on this piece. The detail isn't great and I wouldn't buy this again <end>
 B000P57PTO  Sterling Silver Celtic Design Bracelet, 8" ||	  A very good choice  Having agreed to celebrate our anniversary with only a nice dinner out, I couldn't let pass our 25th without getting my wife a gift. Unfortunately, I waited until the 11th hour. Amazon's Express Delivery came through, like the calvary in an old western. My wife's silver bracelet arrived 20 minutes before we left for our dinner. She wears it all the time. It's a wonderful rememberance piece!! Thanks, Amazon! <end>  A Great Surprise Gift for Any Lady  My wife and I had agreed that we wouldn't buy any gifts for each other for our anniversary because we are saving money to take our boys to Disney World in a few weeks. I of course did not keep that agreement. I found this beautiful bracelet with a great price. I love all things Celtic, and my wife loves silver jewelry, so this along with the price made a no-brainer as a surprise anniversary gift.It came is a very nice little jewelry bag that I hid beneath her pillow the night before our anniversary.She loves the bracelet and now wears it daily.Come on guys, for the price, there is no better way to surprise your lady... it costs about the same amount as what you would spend on a nice bouquet of roses and will last for years to come. <end>  A perfect gift  I received this bracelet as a Christmas gift. I put it on and haven't taken it off! It's sturdy, yet lightweight. I love that it has an adjustable clasp for a perfect fit for different size wrists. I also received the matching earrings (also wonderful) and now the matching pendant is on my wish list. <end>  Silver Celtic Bracelet  Sterling Silver Celtic Design Bracelet, 8"I was looking for something different from the usual chain bracelets you always see for men. I was pleased to find this one on Amazon. When it arrived and I opened the package, it was everything I had hoped it would be; beautifully designed, heavy-weight, fine quality sterling. I am proud to wear it. <end>  Great Quality for the Price  Adorable little Bracelet. I had one similar to this one years ago I purchased from Colonial Williamsburg. It had the same kind of "fret" work design. It is a very well made bracelet and I enjoy wearing it. <end>  Perfect  I love this bracelet and I never, ever (used to) wear bracelets. It was a gift from my fiance, who clearly knows my taste 100%. Gotta love that man! It's very, very easy to put on cuz it is a little big for me, but I love the size. I can actually take it off and put it on without clasping & unclasping it. I just slip it off & on, that's how easy it is, lol. I have a 5 1/2" wrist, to give you an idea, so yeah, I'm kinda small boned. But since it's 8", there is plenty of room to clasp & unclasp for 99% of the women out there. And obviously it's a beautiful bracelet, great price & real silver considering I have not taken it off since day 1, which was about a year or so ago and I've never had any green on my wrist anywhere and it has not tarnished 1 little bit. I just clean it every so often & BANG! Looks brand spankin' new! Not that it's aged anyway. So there ya go....great bracelet, great price, stays in perfect condition forever! So fellas....Buy this for your lady!!! She will absolutely LOVE it and it will never leave her wrist! Not to mention saving yourselves a few bucks in the process too, WIN-WIN! It also comes with matching earrings and I THINK a necklace too, but I'm not sure about the necklace. If you wanna spend a little more, that is, which isn't too much anyway. Enjoy! I do. <end>  celtic knot bracelet  This is a very nice bracelet. Pretty design. Looks just like the pic. A little light weight, but pretty just the same. <end>  GREAT!!  Bought this bracelet for my girlfriend and it absolutely made her day! high quality and perfect Celtic design. I would defiantly recommend this to any guy looking for a gift. <end>  Excelent  i recently purchased this item as a gift. It was exactly as pictured and described. It was a major success. <end>  Disappointed from Cape Cod  When I received this bracelet, I was delighted with it. It is light weight and comfortable to wear 24 hours a day. ANd it is nice looking. However, I have since discovered that is is poorly made. The small wire circles that connect the bracelet together are weak. Within few days, one link fell apart and the bracelet fell off. Happily with a pair of pliers, I could squeeze the link back together, but I now realize that this is likely to keep happening, so am reluctant to wear it without watching for this. I expect I will loose it another time. <end>  Celtic Sterling Bracelet  I just love it & have the whole set. It goes with almost any fashion. <end>  Sterling Silver Celtic Design Bracelet, 8"  This bracelet is nice, however, I thought it would be thicker and heavier since I was looking for that type of bracelet. It is very light on the wrist and seems rather delicate. For the price, it's fine but not what I was looking for. <end>  unique bracelet  Bought this, the matching earrings and necklace for a special occasion.When I got it it seem to casual for my event so I returned it. Still the quality and uniqueness were excellent. Considered keeping it, but with Christmas coming, must watch every penny. <end>
 B000P59SOO  Sterling Silver Celtic Design Oval Dangle Earrings ||	  I like my new earrings.  These earrings are shiny silver. I've received compliments on them, and am quite happy with them. I sort of expected them to look a little more hand-made, but they look so perfect, machine-made. But, I still like them a lot and they fit right in with the rest of my silver jewelry collection. <end>  very nice  The earrings were a perfect match with the necklace and had the "look" I wanted. As advertized. Prompt service and I won't hesitate to order from them again. <end>  Love the earrings  These are beautiful earrings. They came packaged nicely. I wear them often because they flatter my face.I recommend them to women who like silver earrings. <end>  Small but pretty  The earrings are very pretty but alot smaller then I thought they would be. I wished they were bigger. I also wish that there were rubber tabs for them to help keep them on. <end>  nice, moderately-sized silver earrings  I like silver dangle earrings but have a hard time finding those that aren't so heavy they pull my earlobes down. These are perfect in that regard, and are very attractive too! The measurement listed, 35 mm, is from the tip of the dangle to the tip of the fishhook that goes through your ear; the dangle or charm itself is about 25 mm. I find this size ideal; others may disagree but now you know. The earrings are stamped and good quality for the price. They also come attractively packaged and include clear rubbery backs or stoppers to avoid loss. <end>  Silver Celtic Earrings  I asked for and received these earrings for Christmas. They look just as good as they do on screen. And for anyone else who might be wandering (as I had been), they hang almost 1 1/2" down. <end>  Very nice, my girl was impressed  I've gotten the entire matching set of this Celtic style, the necklace, bracelet and now these earrings. The quality for the price is a good deal and it certainly will make the right woman's day! <end>  Just the right size...  I bought these for my 13-year old grandaughter for Christmas. I should have bought TWO pair -- one for her and one for me! Very pretty  not too big, and not too small -- about an inch long. These versatile earrings can be dressed up or down. A great buy! <end>  great jewlery!  I have ordered four sets of earrings. Several for gifts. Also have the necklace and bracelet. Very stylist -- receive a compliment almost everytime I wear them! Great workmanship and value. <end>  Great earrings  I love these earrings. I like Celtic jewelry and these are nice quality and easy to wear. They look good with everything!Rising Sun - Interconnected Celtic Knot Tree and Roots of Life Sterling Silver Pendant <end>  sterling silver celtic earrings  The first order the box was empty. I emailed Amazon and they sent the pair within a few days. The earrings are great and look great too. <end>  Nice for the price, wife loves them  My wife really liked these earings and the price was fair with free shipping. Anytime you can please the wife with a nice b-day gift without fighting the mall is a win in my book. <end>  BEAUTIFUL!!  These earrings are not only beautiful but comfortable to wear. Their smooth design does not catch in fabric or knits. Their style blends beautifully with other types of jewelry although they have enough presence to stand on their own. <end>  celtic earrings are a charm  The earrings are very high quality and well-engineered - they do _not_ fall out of your ears. They are well-balanced due to the shape of the clip and the high quality silver (heavy yet polished) in both the earring and the clip. Beyond that they are beautiful! I love to wear them. Oh, did I mention that they arrived quickly, well ahead of the estimated arrival date? <end>  earrings were widely praised  Bought them for my sister. Heard from both her and my mother and friends of my mother how nice they were. My sister also said she got compliments at work. Can't ask much more from earrings. <end>  Exactly as expected  My wife loves these with the matcing pendant. Not too big - right size for her. <end>  Silver Earrings  These earrings are very comfortable, I forget that I have them on until I get compliments. I am an older woman that sometimes feels pain after wearing earrings all day but this pair is great. <end>  It is terrible!!! There is nothing but a small box in the package! where is my earing??  It is so terrible and unbelievable that there is nothing but a small empty box in the package!!! Where is my earing??? <end>  New favorite  Got these for my birthday. Bought the pendant, too. They are great to wear together or separately and casual or dress up. My new favs! <end>  Love 'em - gorgeous!  I love these earrings. I think they're really pretty. Definitely not cheap/dinky looking, and definitely made of real silver. In Texas, James Avery is one of the most popular jewelry stores, and this is as good as anything you would buy there. Another good thing - they're not too heavy! <end>  Cute earrings - great size!  TheseSterling Silver Celtic Design Oval Dangle Earringswere just as I hoped they would be - shiny, intricate pattern, & good size for everyday wear. I bought them as a gift, but now I want my own pair! <end>  Beautiful  Loved the earrings...they have a nice weight and size. I would order from this line again. <end>  Smaller than expected, but elegant and high quality!  I agree with some other posters that the earrings were smaller than they appear in the picture, but they are high quality and came well packaged, quickly shipped, and exactly as described. These are great earrings to wear with jeans or on a nicer occasion, since you can dress them up or down. I'm very happy with this purchase! <end>  oval celtic earrings  The earrings were lovely as advertised, and came in beautiful felt pouch. As these were a gift for a friend, the pouch was a nice surprise. Thank You! <end>  Mother's Day Surprise  Surprised my wife with the Celtic design oval necklace and earrings for Mother's Day. Won me many points - she was not expecting anything like this. <end>  Look summer wonderful!  These are wonderful for summer wear, silver is so light to the eyes.

I bought this pair of earrings for my wife as a xmas present, and was not disappointed..she loved it...but i thought it could have been a little bigger. In my view the picture looked alot larger, but in reality its only about 1" long. Other than that, its a beautiful design, shiny, and looks great on her. <end>  GREAT DAILY EARRINGS!  LOVE THIS EARRINGS! ITS GREAT FOR DAILY USE! MATCH WITH ANY OUTFIT AND HAIR STYLE! STYLISH AND BEAUTIFUL SILVER! I LOVE AMAZON COLLECTION -ALWAYS GREAT SELECTION AND FAST SHIPPING, THANK YOU!  ) <end>  Beautiful without being ostentatious  My wife liked these so much she added the companion necklace to her wishlist.

I believe there is a matching bracelet, and I will hopefully be able to purchase that next and have a lovely set. <end>  Celtic Earrings  Bought these as a gift for my daughter and she wears them all the time.

My wife likes them a lot and has gotten a lot of compliments when wearing them. <end>  Perfect!  These earrings are wonderful. Smooth and shiny, with a good weight to them - not too heavy, but not flimsy, or "cheap" feeling, at all. I wouldn't change a thing about them =] <end>  A hit with a teen!  Any of you with a teenage daughter would have to agree, if you find something that you picked out and they actually use/wear it, you did a great job. Well, my daughter and her friends love these earrings. I must admit, I really like the feel of them and how they look on her. What a great addition to her growing collection.I also think many adults would also enjoy these. <end>
 B000P5BVGC  Sterling Silver Celtic Design Square Link Bracelet, 8" ||	  Great item!  I bought the entire set when Amazon was having their 20% off celtic jewelry sale (earrings, bracelet and pendant). What a great deal. Got a lot of compliments. Items are lovelier than they show in the picture and high quality for the price. Highly recommend! <end>  Lovely bracelet!  I bought this as a gift and was very pleased by its quality. It has a nice weight to it, which matters to me in jewelry, as it seems like the weight should be enough that you are aware that it is there, while being neither intrusive or bothersome. Obviously, it is a balancing act. This bracelet is pleasing in its weight and style.I was worried that it looked rather boxy and was pleased to see that the boxiness is offset by the circular links. It has a rather classic celtic motif which also made it interesting.This is a nice bracelet at a nice price. <end>  You get what you pay for  It's pretty enough, but much smaller then I realized. The length is actual 7 3/4" which is fine since my wife has small wrists, but if you are expecting a full 8" it'll be problematic. Also much narrower then I would have guessed, may be 1/4" or so. Looks nice, a classical celtic knotwork design, and seems to be holding up okay, but not truly what was advertised. Given the fact that the size is less then stated, I'd imagine that the silver content is too. Sadly, you get what you pay for... sigh. <end>
 B000P60N10  Men's 9mm Comfort Fit Tungsten Carbide Plain Wedding Band ||	  Too Expensive  Tungsten is an industrial grade metal, and asking $250 for no more than 20 grams is absolutely ridiculous. WAY WAY WAY OVER PRICED. <end>  Overpriced  I have to agree with the first review, this ring is simply overpriced. I've owned several tungsten rings now, and have never payed more than $50 for one, and some much less than that. And I'm talking about rings that are far fancier than this one. Here's a roughly equivalent tungsten ring for $30 High Polish Beveled Edge Tungsten Carbide Ring sizes 9 to 12And that ring features only minimal styling. You could just as easily move up to this absolutely gorgeous ring which features a similar concave design but also gorgeous laser cut-styling, for a grand total of $49 8MM Concave Black Laser Etched Tungsten Carbide Ring Wedding Band Sizes 8 to 13In fact, a quick search for tungsten rings on Amazon will quickly show that these prices are not unusual, but are in fact par for the course. Tungsten is a perfect ring-making material that I highly recommend. I have two that I've worn for over a year now that are still scratch-free, despite the abuse I put them through, wearing on the job, etc. So unless you're absolutely dying for this exact styling you have a lot of options.On another note, I own a concave ring similar to this one and must say that they look and feel great. Even though tungsten doesn't scratch, the concave design makes the possibility of scratching even more remote. I own the second ring I linked here, and I am quite confident that the center design will remain beautiful for decades to come due to the protective concave shape. <end>
 B000P65EWI  Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Three-Stone Ring, Size 7 ||	  Not the right color  My wife saw this and LOVED the color of the stones. She was thrilled that it came in a size she could wear.She opened it Christmas Day...and was really disappointed in the color. It's nearly WHITE!If she had wanted a CZ white diamond, that's what she would have asked for.It IS very nicely made, BUT she wanted the deep, lovely blue that was shown in the ad.We are checking into sending it back. <end>  Beautiful Quality workmanship  Whe I reveicev this ring, I was amazed at the quality of the ring. I was so impressed that I purchased the Amethyst too. <end>  It's a real "gem"!  I got the ring yesterday and it's lovely! The colour is fantastic... not exactly like the picture, but not far off! I love it! Fits perfect! My boyfriend isn't real great at buying jewelry (that I like) and this weekend is our 8 year anniversay together, so I wrapped it up for him to give me!! hahah He laughed, but knew I was happy with this simple, inexpensive, ring - that looks AWESOME! <end>  ok quality, stone looks cheap though  got it returned because the stones are much much lighter than shown on the picture here. They looks just like glass peices. <end>  Pretty  Pretty ring! But it's lighter than it looks in the picture... psh. But it's good quality for the price! <end>  excellent ring forr the money  will recommend this to whonever wants to buy their honey a special ring and score brownie points at the same time.CUDOS <end>  Disappointed by stone coloring  I really looked forward to this product, because I love blue topaz. I was very happy with the quality of the silver. However, the stones were MUCH lighter than the picture showed. So much so that I would label the photo shown as false advertising. Others had found the same, but I thought perhaps the color would be more toward aquamarine. It's not; it's toward the white. I also know that deep blue topaz or London blue is not that expensive to make. I'm keeping it, because it is pretty, but I'm disappointed with the stone color and, judging from other reviews, I know a replacement will be no better. <end>  Nice little ring  This just arrived and I really like it. The color is a bit more pale than shown in the image so I can only give this 4 stars, but the sterling shank is very substantial and the mounting is well done. I snagged this little beauty for 10 bucks, and will be watching for the amethyst version to take a quick price drop as well so I can have both. Wish I had purchased several of this one, but the negative comments of other reviewers persuaded me to just get one. Price is back up to 20 today, so I will keep an eye out for another sale. <end>  A lot of compliments  I bought this not really expecting too much, just that it was pretty. Since I have worn it, I get a lot of compliments on the color how beautiful it is. The ring sits very nicely upon your finger. If gives my hand a very smooth look. I beleive I got a good deal for the price. <end>  Very Pleased!  I was thrilled to find such a lovely ring in my size, which is a 9. It fits perfectly and I love it! <end>
 B000P6GD4Q  Buffy Prop Replica  Anyanka's Amulet ||	  Irrelevant questions review  This was bought for use as jewelry, not a toy. As jewelry, its very pretty and looks great on my daughter. It looks even better than the pictures. <end>  The Symbol of Anyanka's Power Center!!!!  I am one of the biggest Buffy the Vampire Slayer Fans ever. The Symbol of Anyanka prop replica!!! This is truly awesome. It looks exactly like the one Emma Caufield (Anya) wore as a vengence demon in Buffy  The Vampire Slayer Season 3 episode called "The Wish" where Cordellia wishes that Buffy never came to Sunnydale. I absolutely LOVE this prop replica of Anyanka's Power Center only thing is that it is gold plated over some kind of dingy copper metal which kinda stinks. If it was gold plated over sterling silver it would be perfect even to wear because it's soo cool to even look at! I still love it but I "wish" it was made of silver and it was gold plated or even real gold. Still very cool for Buffy fans like me who LOVED Anya (Emma Caufield's character). Anya was truly one of the coolest characters in the Buffy universe!! <end>
 B000P6R31I  Sterling Silver Circle Pendant with CZ Drop & Chain 18" ||	  Makes a Great Gift Without Hurting the Wallet  I gave this necklace to my mother as part of her Christmas and she loved it. She thought I paid a lot more than I actually did. If you're looking to impress but not go broke doing it, this works pretty well. I gave it four instead of five because the CZs could be more shiny. <end>
 B000P772G8  Rosary - Gold Toned Irish Celtic Cross with Green Glass Shamrock Beads and Enameled St. Patrick Medal Attached ||	  Celtic Rosary Beads  Got these in 5 days..and they are awesome, well crafted and are the perfect length!! You will not be disappointed <end>  a very pleased irishman  well for one the rosary is even more better looking in person and it came here two days before it said it would arrive and its even a crucifix which it thought it wasn't so im even more pleased with it i would buy again <end>  love it  I didn't see shamrocks in the picture, but there are tiny ones on the beads. It arrived 5 days earlier than I expected. <end>
 B000P7ME52  DESIGNER INSPIRED CZ RING - Champagne & White CZ Cocktail Ring ||	  Lovely pink cocktail  I have always yearned for a pink diamond, but the price was to much for me. This one is pretty. Done well, can't wait to wear it. <end>

 B000P8VLSW  Extra Huge Filigree Butterfly on a Silver Tone 30" Chain Necklace ||	  love it  I gave this as a gift. And they love it.The chain is a little thin, but hey look at the price.It hangs low off the neck line. It looks great, and the butterfly is huge, extra huge really means extra huge. <end>
 B000P9EZHU  Sterling Silver Polished Celtic Design Pendant with 18 inch Cable Chain ||	  AWESOME!  LOVE LOVE LOVE THE PIECE! Smaller than what I thought, but thats quite alright with me. thinkin of ordering one for my sister. The peice came very quick, and im for sure going to order again.! <end>
 B000P9FVZU  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Charming Onyx Fish Hook Dangle Earrings ||	  Cheap Cheap  Don't waste your money. The very first day I wore these earrings the onyx fell out of one of the earrings. I didn't know who to send it back until now. <end>  Smaller than they look  I just received my earrings and am not happy. They look like miniature versions of what I see on the screen, and I don't see any dimensions published (now I know why). I will send these back (if the shipping isn't more than the cost!). <end>
 B000P9HTF0  Nickel Free Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Drop 21mm x 8mm Pendant ||	  BEAUTIFUL PENDANT!  Sparkle, sparkle! You'll be glad you purchased this gorgeous pendant! It's a nice size, not too big or too small. Everyone compliments me when I wear it! <end>  extremly beautiful piece  I thought it would be really nice by the picture. When I got it I was really overwhelmed by it's beauty. If I didn't know better I would think it was really diamonds in white gold. Just a wonderful piece of jewlery <end>
 B000P9IQWU  Sterling Silver Polished Four Leaf Clover Celtic Design Pendant with 18 inch Cable Chain ||	  necklace and earring set  The four leaf clover necklace goes very well with the matching earrings.

 B000PAM364  Sterling Silver and Stainless Steel Mezuzah Medal, 20" ||	  Beautiful simple and elegant sterling silver Mezuzah  This is a bautiful simple and elegant sterling Mezuzah which I am so happy to get for a very reasonable price. The seller was quick with delivery and described with picture perfectly. Recommend seller and her products Highly. Thank you. <end>  better than expected  beautiful!! Came on Time and it looks better in person. my grandson will be delighted. The chain is a nice weightas well. <end>  Great piece, chain is not nickel free  I bought this piece thinkiing the chain was also nickel free. However, only the mezuzah itself is nickel free. Otherwise this is a very simple, masculine, elegant piece. Good length without being too much of a "jesus piece". Just be aware that you'll have to buy another chain if you have a nickel allergy. <end>  Good product  This mezuzah is fine. Good fulfillment, fine product. Just what I wanted at a very good price. Is this enough words now? <end>  Sterling Silver Mezuzah Medal, 20"  Bought as a Christmas present for my son. Arrived quickly, was pleasently surprised to receive a discount on it that I was not expecting so that made it even better. Thank You. Would most definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  OK but...  It is not what you will call high end looking...but then again the price reflects it. The pendant itself is actually very charming but the chain makes the whole thing appear cheap. I actually found an old chain that is has a much more elegant appearance and replaced the original...now i get compliments on it all the time. <end>
 B000PAMAPI  Sterling Silver Scroll Design Garnet Ring by Sajen, Size 7 ||	  Beautiful ring  I bought this as a graduation gift for my daughter. She wanted a ring to remind her of her college completion without having a "class ring". She also requested a wide band. When I ordered it, I thought that it would do until I found something "nicer". That changed when the ring arrived. The picture does not begin to do it justice. It is a beautiful ring, elegant and feminine without having a "little girl" look. And, as lovely as it was in the box, it looks 100 times better on her hands. The only caveat I have is to order a larger than normal size. My daughter wears a size 5 ring but wide bands usually do better with a larger ring. I ordered a 6 and it fits perfectly. Final notes  The shipping was fast and the presentation (box) is beautiful as well. <end>
 B000PAMB0C  Sterling Silver Seraphinite Adjustable Ring by Sajen, Size 7 ||	  Not what I expected  I returned mine. The ring is very large...taking up the entire length of my finger between my middle and end knuckle. Some people can carry this look off but it is not a good look for a smallish person like me. Also, the "stone" part looks like enamel rather than the cool, unique stone that I thought it was going to look like. The color is beautiful but is lacks the depth and variety that would make it look like a true natural stone. <end>
 B000PAMBAC  Sterling Silver, Peridot and Iolite Dangle Earrings by Sajen ||	  Great pair of earrings  These earrings have a great color to them. The peridot is bright. The iolite is a nice shade of blue. The silver compliments the earrings. The only drawback is they are smaller than I thought. If you like a conservative length, these are great. <end>
 B000PAMBCA  Sterling Silver, Garnet and Citrine Post Earrings by Sajen ||	  more brown than red  The garnets in these earrings are more brown than red. They are still OK, just not what I expected since garnets are red. <end>  Gorgeous  I gave these away as a gift, but really wanted to keep them for myself. <end>
 B000PAMC42  Sterling Silver Double Garnet Dangle Earrings by Sajen ||	  Love my new Christmas earrings!  I decided I wanted some new red earrings to wear with my various red Christmas garments and after looking at many on Amazon, I settled for these.When they arrived and I tried them on, I was delighted. The garnets are a stylish cranberry shade and are nice and clear. I also like the intricate pattern in the silver and the modest length because it doesn't get caught in my collars.The stones on the Amazon page make them appear about the size of a pencil eraser, but they're not that big; closer to 3/4th that size would be fairly accurate. Other than that tiny "nit," I'm very pleased with these pretty earrings.If any of you men are looking for an extra stocking stuffer for your loved one, I can recommend them highly. I think they're perfect for sisters, mothers, wives, sweethearts and even teen daughters. Go for it!Reviewed by Betty Dravis, December 4, 2010Author of "Dream Reachers" (with Chase Von) and other books <end>  beautiful earrings  Bought these earrings for my mother to match a necklace and she absolutely loves them. <end>  Very pretty!  These garnet and silver earrings are very pretty. I bought them for my mother because her birthstone is garnet. They look nice on, although I wish the garnets were just a little bigger. But the color is beautiful and the earrings look well made. <end>
 B000PAMC88  Sterling Silver, Iolite, Blue Topaz and Mother-of-Pearl Earrings by Sajen ||	  Solid and Well Made - Pretty, Too!  These earrings are so well made! The stones sit on a solid silver base and the posts are not flimsy and are notched to hold the bases in place. These earrings look really good - stylish and classy. I would definitely buy more earrings by Sajen. Edit - I've worn the earring several times and received tons of compliments! <end>
 B000PAMCQU  Sterling Silver Scroll Design Lapis Ring by Sajen, Size 8 ||	  Nice but not as nice as other Sajen rings  A while ago I got the "Sterling Silver Garnet Ring by Sajen" for one of my friends. That ring is beautiful and very similiar to this one. However when I got this one for one of my other friends, although it is a nice ring, in my opinion it is not as nice as the first one I bought. For one, the scroll design does not go all the way around (I thought it would), and at least on the one I received, the stone and setting is a little malformed (not a nice rectangle).Overall it is still a very nice piece. The recipient of the ring loved it. I would go for the Garnet version first though if you don't already have it. A plus with both these rings is that the back is open so it is adjustable. <end>
 B000PAO48O  Sterling Silver and Stainless Steel Round St. Christopher Medal, 20" ||	  Beautiful quality  Not only a great medal, the chain is sturdy and worth keeping as well! I would recommend it to anyone <end>  Perfect!  This turned out to be the best gift my daughter received for Christmas It was boxed nicely and packaged as to not get the chain tangled. Beautiful medallion. <end>  Beautiful necklace.  My secretary at work really liked this St Christopher Medal necklace, which I gave her as a Christmas gift this year. <end>  St Christopher pendant  The pendant was lighter and slightly smaller than expected. However, the detail was very well done and the chain was longer than expected. It arrived quickly. Happy with purchase. <end>  Just waht I ordered  It is exactly what I ordered. I don't have any complaints. I wish the chain were longer but that isn't their problem. <end>  St. Christopher Medal  The St. Christopher medal was just the right size and weight and I put it on a sterling silver rope chain and together they good great <end>  Nice.  This item was purchased for my husband and he loves it. Beautiful and sturdy just as promised. Great value delivered. <end>  Ron P.  Very beautiful necklace for a lady and really liked it for a gift would recommend it to anyone looking for a St. Christopher <end>  awesome  It came in perfect condition and size as stated. It was a great gift. I couldn't be happier. Arrived quickly and in a safe, secure package. <end>  Great size for a lady!  I order this nicklace for myself and I love it! perfect size for a lady who does not like large coins. <end>  Beautiful!  I really love this item, these are truly beautiful. I ordered two, one for my goddaughter and one for myself. As a word of warning they are small and the chain they come with is short for a man. It will be perfect for a youth or a woman. I personally do not mind the small medal and I will be fine purchasing a longer silver chain for myself. <end>  Nice!  In fact I want another one,friend kept aggravating me to get it and finally I did.I will get one soon. <end>  Problems twice  The first time we ordered from this company we received a gold chain instead of a silver chain. We returned it and reordered and received a chain with a broken clasp. We returned it and found a much nicer quality chain and pendant at Things Remembered. <end>  Beautiful..  Its so beautiful, I got it for my son in dedication to my late brother who had a similar one like this. Its a little cartoony, but its a St.Christopher medal so we don't mind. Its great for the young kids! <end>  Wonderful!  I got this for my mom for Christmas and it is absolutely gorgeous! I love the clarity and overall look. I am taking it to our priest for a blessing befor Christmas and I hope it brings my mother luck...Thank you very much! <end>  St. Christopher medal  This was a gift for my sister. It arrived in a timely fashion and she loves it. I was very pleased with the service. Thank you! <end>  Very nice  I bought this St. Christopher medal for my grandson, who plays football. He loves it and wears it all the time. The chain is long enough to wear under his shirt if he prefers. Would recommend. <end>  High quality, beautiful medal  I purchased this St. Christopher medal as a confirmation gift for a friend's daughter. I shopped around and saw many different styles and sizes and with cost being a concern, I chose this one. When I received it, I was VERY pleased. It was heavier than I had expected (for the cost) and was bright and shiny. It is a nice piece of jewelry. The chain is plain and simple, and may be something others choose to replace, but I found it perfect for a young lady who chooses to wear it under her clothes, discreetly. The medal, however, is something she now brings out to show her friends often. She loves it and I am very happy that I could provide her with such a nice St. Christopher piece. <end>  Great Gift  I bought this necklace for my sister, who wears it all the time. It is a beautiful necklace, and a good buy for the price. The shipping was excellent, and I would definitely buy from this company again. <end>  sterling st christopher  very nice well made medallion. Smallish - probably an inch or a little less in diameter. Light weight. Pretty. Got it in time for a gift. Good all the way around! <end>  Not what I expected  The necklace I purchased was not what I had anticipated. It was more dainty, like for a lady. The chain was flimsy and the charm was thin. When the box arrived, the necklace was floating loosely within the box. There was a gift box inside along with the little black, velvet gift bag. They were both closed. Not very professional packaging. I have always had good service with Amazon but not this time. <end>  St Christopher Medals  I bought them for the men in my family for Christmas -- to keep them safe because of the driving they all do. The medals are absolutely beautiful. In fact I'm going to order four more for the women in my family. <end>  beautiful pendant  As soon as this arrived I put it on. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry with a long enough chain that it doesn't chock me. <end>  Lasted exactly one day.  It's not bad for the price, but unfortunately the medal fell off of the chain in less than 24 hours so now all we have is a cheap chain.  -( <end>  chain  The chain turns black after a while, but over all, to me. it looks good. for the price they shuold make it all stainless steel. not only the medal. <end>  Beautiful craftsmanship  I bought this medal for my nephew's 1st communion and I was very pleased with the quality. The medal itself is about the size of a nickel and the chain is sturdy. The image of St. Christopher is clean and defined. I only wished there was something on the back of the medal like, "Pray for us." It was blank except for the sterling silver mark. I think this is a great gift for anyone interested in wearing a St. Christopher medal. <end>  exactly what it should be  Nothing fancy, but not cheap. I used it as a gift to my girlfriend. She loves it. It's not too big as to be bothersome, but gets noticed by people. <end>  Beautiful Pendant  Bought this for my fiance for Christmas....beautiful pendant, but chain was just a little short. I would recommend it! <end>  Very nice piece!  We purchased this St. Christopher medal for our son as a gift for his First Holy Communion. It just arrived today and, although he hasn't even seen it yet, I think it's just perfect. Very pleased. <end>  Wonderful!  This was a great product, came nicely wrapped. It was exactly what i wanted and better then expected. I would go with them again for it came quickly. <end>

 B000PAOD2Q  Sterling Silver Filigree Tree of Life Earrings by Sajen ||	  intricately petite  These earrings have a beautiful intricate pattern for their petite size. They are wonderfully light weight to wear. <end>
 B000PAOD4Y  Sterling Silver Lapis Vertical Oval Earrings by Sajen ||	  Classic and Beautiful  These sterling silver lapis earrings answered a need I'd felt for several years. For some reason, most lapis earrings I've found came in yellow gold and while I have a pair in gold, I don't like to mix gold and silver jewelry when I'm wearing a silver watch or pendent. These are just the right size for me--neither too small nor too large, and their design is simple and attractive. They're quite well made and and there is a catch in the back so they don't accidentally slip off, as so many of my earrings seem to do. These are classics and will outlive seasonal changes in earring styles, I think. <end>  Very pretty  These sterling silver lapis earrings are very pretty and just the right size. The quality of these earrings was must better than I had expected. I'm really enjoying wearing them.Elna Marshall03/02/2010 <end>
 B000PAOD7Q  Sterling Silver Carved Cinnabar Heart and Garnet Pendant by Sajen ||	  I didn't know "Cinnabar" meant cheap plastic...  I recently purchased three Sajen pieces, two of them were beautiful, and then there was this one. The silverwork and the garnet were both really nice. It was the Cinnabar Heart that ruined the piece for me. I was picturing a carved stone with at least a slight bit of visual texture. Cinnabar (the mineral) should be very refractive unless it is purposely dulled. This is very, very dull cinnabar. This looked like a very matte wax, something that would be decorative on a candle. It will be pretty enough as long as no one looks too closely at it, but overall, I'm far from thrilled with this piece. <end>  OK pendant  This is a big pendant. I didn't find it as pretty as the picture, as the cinnabar really overpowers the whole pendant. Also, cinnabar is completely opaque and looks like solidified play dough which I didn't know. It is an OK pendant, but would have been nicer if it was smaller. <end>

 B000PAOHCW  Sterling Silver Loving Family Heart Necklace - Mother and 2 Children ||	  Like a little sculpture!  I bought this for Christmas for my 21-year-old daughter- in- law, and she thought it was beautiful. She wears it every day. <end>  A great gift!  I bought this necklace for my Boyfriend's mother on her birthday. She is a proud mom of two boys and I figured this gift would appeal to her. And yes, she absolutely loved it! She gets compliments for the pendant from her friends and co-workers all the time. <end>  Loving Family pendant  I was very pleased with the necklace.. BUT it was shipped in a little plastic bag. I bought it with another necklace which came with a small box... I had to go out and purchase a box as this was a mother's day gift for my daughter. <end>  a little too tinny - I would have liked a heavier piece  These pieces - I ordered one for each of the births of my grandsons -just didn't measure up to the pictures. I thought they would be a heavier piece. The edges were so thin they actually seemed sharp. I was happy I had something to give my girls when my grandsons were born but I wish the pieces were more substantial. <end>  very nice  It was a gift for my best friend and she loved it. the chain is not very strong and if I would have know I would have bought a different chain with it. <end>  Deceptive picture  The item is flatter than the picture makes it seem. The wife is still pleased with it the quality and looks of it so I can't complain much since it's also fairly inexpensive. <end>  Lovely gift  I gave this necklace as a gift to my mother and she loved it. It looks very elegant and is not "cheap-looking". I was a little deceived by the photo in terms of the size of the pendant, however the actual size is a good size. A great gift to someone or yourself! <end>  Loving Family Pendant  My wife was very pleased with this pendant but I don't feel that it exactly lived up to my expectatoins. From the online photo it looks like the entire pendant is a polished silver but in fact the inside of the pendant is more rough and not the smooth polished surface of the outside. Not a big deal but it would definitely have been nicer if the entire pendant was a polished silver. <end>  Nice gift idea  The chain was a little short for my mothers neck but other than that it was a beautiful pendant. My mother loved it as a birthday present.The size of the actual pendant was a little smaller than I expected, but in a good way. I was worried it would be too big but turned out to be perfect, a little bigger than my thumb nail. Nice size!Would recomend to anyone looking to get their mom a little gift. Nice quality. <end>  chain broke bu they sent another.  the chain was broke but they sent another so no problems. I'm happy with it <end>  Not the best quality  Although not expensive (I guess you get what you pay for) the chain broke in a couple of weeks. When you give it as a gift to your wife and the quality is not what you were hoping for, well, it's disappointing. <end>  Go to gift  Having trouble figuring out what to get that one person who you know almost nothing about except that she loves her kids more than anything in the world? Get her this! <end>  Gorgeous  I ordered this item for my mother for Valentine's Day and I'm really looking forward to seeing her face when she receives it. It's exquisitely made and aesthetically pleasing. <end>  Beautiful!  I always wanted this necklace! Took me forever to finally get one for myself. It is beautiful and I ordered another for someone who is having her first child. <end>  very nice!  this is a very nice pendant. It is very shiny, and the necklace is a good weight. I have gotten several compliments on it. <end>  love this  strong. durable and light enough that I can sleep with it around my neck at night and not get choked. I wear it in the shower <end>  happy  This was a Christmas present for a dear friend who is widowed with two children. She loved it! I have seen her many times since Christmas and she has had this on every time. Very pretty! <end>  Christmas Gift  I bought this for my niece for Christmas. It is a little flatter then I expected, but it is still a very pretty necklace. She loved it though. If there were more Mommys like my niece, the world would be a better place! <end>  Excellent product and speedy delivery  Purchased this item as a gift for my mom. Came in a display box that was perfect to wrap and open. Contained all authenticity in the box. <end>  Perfect!  I haven't taken it off since Christmas! Perfect sentiment for me, I wear it always, my children are my life! clasp is substancial, chain strong, detail on pendant - perfect! <end>  Mother Child Charm Neclace  I just love this and I am sure our daughter-in-law will love it too at Christmas. We started our shopping early this year. It is a very unique design and seems to be great quality. I have not seen it other places. Perfect for a mother! <end>  Just Priceless!!  What you see is exactly what you get. The description and size are right on. So, if you like the picture, you will love the necklance. It is a beautiful pendant. It's a great depiction of a mother and two children. I just love it. <end>  Very Charming Pendant - The Size Seems Right  This pendant shows a mother and two children holding hands. The arms form an unbroken circle that also looks like a heart. The size seems perfect to me. I thought about getting the larger one and am glad I didn't because this one seems to be the right size.What I like about this pendant in particular is the meaning it represents. It's the type of thing my wife can wear frequently and will go with just about any attire.There is value in this purchase. I think the price is great and this could probably fetch a much higher price in some stores. It does not look cheap. I'm not sure about the chain, whether it will hold up, though. <end>  Bought as a Mother's Day gift for a Friend  I bought this as a Mother Day gift for a friend of mine with 2 daughters, she really liked it! It makes a nice gift! <end>  Just what I wanted.  I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my mother. I loved it and so did she. I asked my husband to get one for me for my birthday. <end>  lovely silver necklace  This was a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased with it. If she is happy, then I am happy too! <end>  The Perfect Gift  I got this for my mother for Mother's Day. She loved it. The price is great. It should have cost more. My mother wears it all the time and she brags about it to all her friends. It's the best gift I have ever gotten anyone! <end>  wife loved it.  Bought this for mothers day and my wife loved it, came in a nice box and looks very nice. <end>  Gift  Got it as a mother's day gift for my mother-in-law. She loves it. I love how they have all different families. I got my own mom the 2 parents 3 children one. Both moms loved their necklaces. <end>  The perfect gift  I purchased this for my mother (a single parent with 2 children) as a thank you gift for EVERYTHING she has done, especially in the lead up to my recent wedding. She adores the pendant and it is exactly as described and pictured online. A great gift for mothers. Thank you for this lovely product! <end>  Great concept but not the best quality  I ordered this as a gift for a my sister-in-law and was a bit disappointed. I really like the idea behind the mother and children but the overall quality of both the packaging and necklace/pendant itself wasn't up to par with the price tag. I ended up feeling like I was giving her a much cheaper gift than what I actually paid for it. <end>  My most cherished piece of jewelry  I had one w/ just a mom and one child. My husband bought me this one for our new baby. This is one piece of jewelry I wear the most. Made well, Never Take it off. <end>  Beautiful!  This was a gift for my daughter. She recently had twins, so I especially liked the design. The necklace has a very nice quality feel to it...very soft, and expensive feel. Thanks! <end>  Great present  Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loved it. Arrived on time and was a great price too. Thanks. <end>  Perfect  Perfect gift from children to mother. I would recommend to anyone wishing to make a mother happy. A five star! <end>  Very pleased  This was the perfect gift for my daughter. It was very good quality with a sturdy chain. It was was a perfect size, not too big, not too small. I would recommend this. <end>  Mother's Necklace  My daughter loves this necklace, which I purchased for my infant granddaughters to present her on Christmas. The pendant is well-constructed. The chain is very lightweight and will need replacing. However, for the price, I assumed I would have to replace it. It does allow her to wear it until we get a stronger one. <end>  disappointed  I had previously purchased a mother child necklace and liked it so much when another child came along I wanted the same one with 2 children. The picture shows an all silver necklace but the one I received had white enamel in the middle and that changed the entire appearance of it. The picture shows all silver. The white doesn't look good at all. <end>  What a beautiful necklace...  Was a gift for my best friend who cherished the necklace the minute she received it. The necklace & chain are of beautiful quality - just as described. Item arrived in no time after order was placed, even during the busy holiday season. Will definitely order more items from this seller. <end>  Sweet and small, but lovely as well.  While the necklace is small as other reviewers have stated, and a little flatter than the photo reflects, it is still graceful and sweet and nice quality. I am overall pleased with the product and would order again if need arises. <end>  nice for a kid to a mom gift  Bought this pendant as a Christmas gift for my wife as a gift from our two boys. It's not the nicest piece of jewelry I've bought for her but since it's coming from them she will love it. For the money I believe it's ok. Something a Mom can wear proudly. <end>  love it  I love it. I get so many compliments...I love that you have single moms and children. again thank you... I will tell friends and co workers. <end>  Beautiful  I love this necklace and have gotten many compliments on it. The only thing that would make it better is if it were a little bigger. <end>  Love it!  Got this as a gift for Valentines Day and it is lovely. Really pleased with it, got lots of compliments on it. Beautiful! <end>  BEAUTIFUL PENDENT  I bought this pendent as a gift for a friend. It is beautiful! I think she really likes it. It has a simple, yet elegant design. Very nice! <end>  Beautiful and simple  The sterling silver makes it easy to keep clean and shiny.The chain is of great quality, very easy to adjust, and it will fit most size of women.The pendant is perfect in size, people will notice she is wearing it, but it is not flashy.It is a great gift for any single mother. It does not matter if it is a friend or a co-worker, or even your own mother. <end>  Mom cried! Goal achieved!  Around my house this time of year I have to make my mother cry with something that touches her and has meaning. Well this did it! Reminded me of my brother, mother and I when we were growing up in a single parent family! It is beautiful and well made! Mom took off her cross necklace to put it on....she has had her cross on since 1986. Need I say more? <end>  Beautiful.  This necklace is beautiful. My mother got me the one with just mother and one child and she has been wanting this one for some time now.I love my necklace and knew that she would love this one. It is beautiful. The charm is perfect and sturdy and so is the chain. [Unless you have a baby who likes to pull on things  )]I recommend this necklace for any mother.I am very pleased! <end>  Awsome  Exactly what my wife was looking for! Was shipped and recieved just as they said it would. Would buy more products from them. <end>  Loving Family Mom Gift  My wife loved this christmas gift. It was not as 3 dimensional as I had hoped, and a little smaller than expected, but still very nice and she wears it proudly. <end>  A great deal, a quality product!  I was very impressed with the value I received with this product! The charm is beautiful. The chain looks as though you'd pay a lot more for it than what it costs. I have been wearing mine everyday for about 6 months, and all it needs is an occasional shine with a silver polishing rag. Looks like it did the day I received it. I really like the looks of the chain - very unique. Unfortunately, it tends to kink ever-so-slightly. The easy solution is to lay the chain out flat on a hard surface. Gently roll a glass over the chain from one end to the other. This will flatten out any kinks. But, the kinks are not very noticable when you're wearing it. <end>  It's Lovely  A co-worker recently lost her 4 year old son to cancer and I wanted to give her something which would last longer than flowers, so I chose this necklace. It represents her, her son and her 2 year old daughter along with the bond that can never be broken. It's lovely and exactly as described. I'm very pleased with the quality and quick shiping. <end>  Loving Family Pendant  This pendant is very well made, its beautiful and perfect for wearing at any occasion. I gave it to somebody for valentines today and she absolutely loved it. perfect gift? <end>  Item too small  The mother and children pendant was way too small. The piece looks cheap and more suited as a jewelry piece for a kid. <end>  symbolizes unity  Nice pendant and chain. Not sure it's totally worth the price though. What it represents means more to me. I will keep it of course but won't recommend it. <end>  tarnished and flimsy  This arrived today for my mothers birthday and it's tarnished and cheap looking. I would be embarrassed to give this to her. I will be returning it tomorrow. <end>  Not as "3D" as it appears  the item isn't as impressive as the picture appears. Very flat and not as 3D as I had hoped it would be. For the price, it isn't a bad gift though! <end>  Beautiful!  I got it for my mother on Mother's Day, and she loved it. She has worn it everyday since I gave it to her! Mother's will appreciate it and it is a great present for birthday, Christmas, or Mother's Day. It's a better present than flowers and it's nice to give jewelry that means something. <end>  was not what i had hoped for  i have a family of 4 not a family a of 3. description of this necklace was deceiving! i would like to return it. <end>  BEAUTIFUL PENDANT  I was very impressed when the pendant arrived. Unlike the Kay pendant it is more delicate looking and more defined. You can't appreciate from the photo the elegance of this pendant. not to mention the unique heart that is formed from the arms and hand holding. <end>  Loving Family small sterling loving mother and two children  The product was just as I wanted it to be and had great packaging and a nice gift box with great information about the product. The only problem was with the time it took for the pendant to get here.I realize shipping during the holiday season is hectic but I would have liked to get it sooner. <end>  You'll wear it ALL the time!  The loving family pendants are all lovely, no matter what size your family is. I have purchased different groupings and they are all beautiful. I wear mine every day. Family is very important to me, so I treasure this necklace. The size is perfect, the larger pendant would be too large for me and I am NOT a tiny woman. I also purchased a single adult with four children around her as a gift for a teacher. This teacher never takes her necklace off. <end>  Poor Custoemr Service  The item was not delivered as per estimation/guarantee. Unfortunately I was also never given any kind of information of the status of the shipment either. it ended up arriving 4 days after i contacted customer support. When I call them all they could tell was "It has been shipped". The only relief I had was when it did finally arrive and it at least was as promised in size and beauty. I don't believe I will be a frequent customer with this seller though. <end>  Beautiful  The pendant is beautiful and my daughter wears it everyday. Unfortunately, I ordered it nearly 3 weeks before her birthday but it didn't show up for 5 weeks. It was suppose to be shipped within 2 days...I won't order anything from them again. I'll order from somewhere else next time. <end>  Excellent!!  I ordered this for my mother for Mother's Day and she absolutely loved it. Not only did it arrive early for Mother's Day, but it was even more beautiful in person. On top of that, it came packaged in a beautiful box so I didn't even have to wrap it before giving it to my mom. The only problem that I had, was I couldn't wait to give it to her, and ended up giving it to her before Mother's Day...LOL!She is constantly getting comments on how beautiful and sweet it is, and wears it almost everyday. <end>  Nice Gift  We got this for my mom for Christmas and were very happy with it. It is a very nice product and my mom loved it! <end>  Just okay..cheap looking...wife didn't like it!  I was hopeful on this item reading other reviews but when it came, it was in a cheap looking box and looked cheap. The chain is something you would see in a gum machine and is flimsy and will break easily. The charm is not 3D but more flat and is not heavy, also looks cheap. It appeared like it would be nicer, but wasn't. My wife looked at it on Xmas and was disappointed sadly. I guess you get what you pay for. <end>  Lovely and petite  This was a gift for my mother which she loved, the only thing is that it is a little smaller than I thought. Also the necklace is going slightly darker, which makes me wonder if it is real silver. Besides that the actually charm is gorgeous. <end>  Absolutely beautiful pendant, but get your own chain  I received this for mother's day and absolutely love it! It's such a sweet image of a mother with her children, their arms forming hearts. It's not quite as shiny as it looks in the image, but it's still a nice piece of jewelry, especially for the price!My only complaint was the chain it came on. My daughter gave it a slight tug while I was wearing it, and it snapped in two, not in a fixable way. I now have it on my own silver chain, and I wear it daily.Any mom would love this necklace! <end>  Poor quality  My son bought it for his mom for mothher's day.I must say the packaging was acceptable but the chain started to turn grey to black within one week of use.This has disappointed my son because it is the first time he has actually purchase something for his mom.I am presently seeking my money back. <end>  Its nice idea  I did like it because I ran out of ideas for my sister in law, when I received it looks like on picture but the chain is very cheap looking. The price for the quality received is good although the chain is really bad imo. <end>  Very Small  I didn't like it, the picture on the website made it look bigger than it appears. It looks like children's jewelry. <end>  JUST OK!  It was smaller than I expected. I thought that the description said it was 1 inch. It wasn't quite one inch in length. <end>  Loving Family Heart Necklace  I ordered this as a gift for my sister who is having her second child. She loves it and has received several compliments. I would buy from this jewelry line again. Quality and packaging was good. <end>  Great Quality  I bought this for my wife as her mothers day gift and she loves it. Wears it every day. Very good necklace! <end>  Beautifult little necklace  Bought this for my wife after finding out our second child was on the way. She absolutely loved it. Thanks for the great product! <end>  Really beautiful  The charm was actually even more beautiful once it got to me. The mother is somewhat of a matte finish while the children are shiny silver. A friend of mine thought it was a flip flop charm at first glance, which prompted me to ask random strangers what they thought it was. Turns out, she owes me lunch cause no one saw a flipflop but her. A very unique piece since most people I showed had never seen anything like it. Getting a few more for my mom and sister. <end>  Cheap Quality!  The pictures shown are very favorable to the product. The product itself 'looks' as cheap as it feels. Not the choice for a decerning jewelry lover. I was very dissappointed, but I accept it as my fault. Like the old saying, "Shop cheap....Shop twice!" <end>  mothers day  From my girls to their mom she loved it and my girls were happy, arrived on time no problem done easily <end>  Big hit on Mother's Day!  My wife loved her new necklace and was proudly wearing it on Mother's Day. We have two little boys (2 & 6 yrs old) and the difference in height of the children on the necklace perfectly matches my wife holding hands with our two sons. Very unique and she gets lots of compliments on it. <end>  Sterling Silver Loving Family Heart Necklace-Mother and 2 children  I bought this for my daughter for Mother's Day. She absolutely loved the craftsmanship of the necklace and loved the way it fits on her chest. She put it on immediately and has not taken it off. It was shipped as promised and received in plenty of time for gift-giving and I was happy enough that I have ordered another for another friend. <end>
 B000PAOHD6  Sterling Silver Loving Family Heart Necklace - Mother and 3 Children ||	  Wonderful  I bought this as a present for my daughter. I was excited to find a mother and 3 children in the &#34;Loving Family&#34; items. She loved it too. <end>  Love it!!!  I received this as a gift from my three sons. It's is beautiful. It is sturdy and thick. I have gotten many compliments on it. <end>  chain was paper thin  Hello i gave the necklace to my girlfriend and in less than 12 after the chain just snapped rite in the middle. Pretty messed up that a chain that thin can even be sold. What was it made just to be decorative or something. Well im very disappointed in amazon now and won't be getting something off here ever again. <end>  Loving Family Heart Necklace  This was purchased as a gift---looked just fine when I opened it but have not heard from the recipient yet. <end>  Poor Quality  I had my eye on this necklace for months and finally ordered two as wedding gifts for my mother and mother in law to be as they have both raised three children. When the necklaces arrived they were not at all what I was expecting for the cost. The metal is thin and smaller than I expected, it is difficult to tell what the charm is. I was disappointed and returned both. <end>  Lovely necklace  This was a gift to my mother and she absolutely loves it. At first I was a little nervous because the picture makes it look a lot bulkier than it is but it lays flat to the neck. Perfect size, beautiful piece. Definitely recommend this to everyone. <end>  So adorable!  I ordered 2 for our mothers. They arrived together,and they were beautiful! They have a little scrpit at the bottom of the box for you to personalize your gift. I was in a hurry and didn't realize that until they got the gifts. I was a little disappointed that it comes in a cute box, but the necklace its self was in a small bag. You would have to make your own holes to display it nicely in the box. However,since it is being shipped it was good that they put it in a bag or it could of gotten broken before it arrived. I was happy with them and our mom's loved them as well! <end>  tarnishes  The charm tarnishes extrememly quickly. It is a beautiful design but turned a yucky bronzey color within in a month. <end>  gift  Very special necklace. My Daughter is expecting her 3rd. child and this was just perfect. The size is a good size not to big , but big enough to see the charm perfectly. <end>  Nice pendant  The mother's body is 'frosted', which I wasn't expecting when I ordered it. But I gave it to my mom for Christmas and she loves it. <end>  Cute, cheesy box!  The necklace was cute for $25. I would never have paid full price for it. The box was very cheesy not elegant or classy at all. I felt like it made the necklace look cheap.... <end>  Beautiful but fragile  The pendant was very nice looking and priced well. However, 10 days after the present was bought the chain had broken in my wife's sleep. We were both very disappointed, and will now have to buy a replacement chain. <end>  Great gift  Came just as described and my mom loved it. Also the box it comes in is very nice. Not cheap looking. <end>  Great  Made Mom cry. They were beautiful and cheap..This is a great Christmas present. . . . . . . . <end>  A mothers gift.  I purchase this as a Christmas present for my mother and she really loved it. it is much more elegant than the picture depicts. Very happy with this purchase!!! <end>  Beautiful  It is beautiful a little smaller than I thought but no problem. The pendant is very well done very delicate. I gave it to my mother and she loved it. <end>  great product  my wife loved this necklace, she was in tears. It's not the most expensive piece but it pulled her heart strings pretty good. It is a good size too, I was afraid it was going to be dinky but I was happy when it arrived. <end>  Beautiful  Very nice pendant, well made, heavier than expected (in a good way). Chain that comes with is thin, but nice and clasp wirks well. <end>  She Loved it.  I got this for a gift for a friend, and she absolutley loved. I think this is a perfect gift for any mom. <end>  Great gift for Mom  I purchased this Loving Family Necklace for my Mom for Mother's Day. They come with all different size families and really send a strong, caring message. She cried. ;-) <end>  Beautiful heartwarming necklace  I bought this last year for my mother at Christmas and she loved it. Her house was broken into and they stole all of her jewelry! She was very sad this piece was gone. So I gave it to her again the following Christmas. <end>  small  This necklace is much smaller and flater then i thought it would be. It looks nice but kind of cheap too <end>  I love this necklace.  I got this for Christmas this year. I have three daughters and I think the necklace really captures a mother's love of her children. My youngest has already decided which one is her! It's really pretty and I love it. <end>  Lovely necklace, for a great price!!  I was skeptical at first, but when the pendant arrived it was very nice. It is very lovely, and does not have any sort of "cheap" feel to it. It is petite and sleek; doesn't stand out too bad, but is pretty enough to catch attention! A longer chain is needed when ordering, just so future buyers are aware. But, this was an excellent purchase. <end>  BEAUTIFUL, SPECIAL MOM NECKLACE!  LOVE, LOVE, L-O-V-E this necklace... just gorgeous and so special to wear. Others notice it when I wear it and make wonderful comments on it. The sterling silver was my main attractor... I wanted something beautiful and yet "simple" enough to enjoy wearing with casual or dressy outfits. This works for both. Great price and an excellent gift to give to new moms, grandmothers, mothers at any point in their motherhood basically... and to buy for yourself! Good quality, beautiful and strong enough chain to feel confident it won't break anytime soon. <end>  Pleased with order  I was pleased with the loving family pendant I ordered. Although I thought shipping was a little slow I attributed that to the holiday rush. I would order this again. <end>  A nice, not flashy, necklace  I bought one of these for my mother and mother-in-law. Both loved their necklaces! This necklace is very pretty and subtle. Although I would've liked to have been able to afford the gold, these silver versions are just as lovely. I like the smaller version of the pendant, especially after seeing it in person. I think the larger version would just be too much, although I do tend to prefer more understated jewelry. <end>  Nice looking one year later.  I bought this necklace for my mother-in-law for Christmas in 2010 for under $50. I have seen her wear it frequently and she seems happy with it. she even shed a tear or two considering my father-in-law had just passed away a couple months prior to Christmas. No tarnishing or discoloration, looking as new as the day I bought it. I highly recommend this product. <end>  Christmas 2010  Got this for my mother - who is a single parent of 3 children.She absolutely loves it and wears it every day! <end>  Much smaller  This is a much smaller charm than I was expecting. Still a very nice piece i just wish it was more substantial. <end>  Beautiful unique piece  Even more beautiful than the picture, which does not do this exquisite piece proper justice. My mother proudly relates the compliments she receives when she wears it. I highly recommend! <end>  Very pretty  My husband bought me one of the necklaces, but with two parents and two children. I love mine so much. I ordered this one for my friend. She is going through a difficult divorce and is now on her own with 3 kids. I am going to give it to her for Valentines day. I do not think they look cheap at all, infact the pendant seems to be very well made. It has a beautiful satin finish. The chain is short, but I like to have necklaces of different lengths depending on what I am wearing. My friend and I both work in the medical field and wear scrubs all day. The length of the chain is perfect for our uniforms as it falls right in the V-neck and is easily seen. I read a couple of the other reviews and I saw that a couple of comments were made about the chain getting caught in the sheet or breaking in the nigh, there is a simple remedy to that. TAKE IT OFF BEFORE GOING TO BED! Hope this helps. Also if you are a man, thinking of buying it-go for it. Even though it is inexpensive-women love sentimental things! <end>  SO PRETTY  Its really nice piece of jewerly for any mother to own. I ordered it for mother and she loves it! <end>  Mom loved it!  This item made my mother cry. True, it is a little smaller than excepted, but the dimensions are correct....the pendant just seems smaller than the picture. But its beautiful, shiny, and not at all cheap looking. It comes in a cute gift box that you dont even need to wrap. All my other family members loved it when my mother showed it to them. <end>  Just what I wanted  I have been wanting a mothers ring for years, but have not found the perfect one. I saw this necklace, only with a mother, father and your choice of how many children. I scrolled further down and found this version, how perfect!! I'm still looking for the ring though! I would recommed this neclace to any mother! <end>  very good  This was a gift for my mother for Christmas. She put it on right away and enjoyed looking at it in the mirror. This product was better then I expected and the quality is great. <end>  Special  My 6 year old son picked this out for me and he checks every morning to make sure that I am wearing it! I am very happy with the quality of the pendant and the chain is very nice as well. <end>  Loving Family  This is a beautiful piece.I wear it daily. It was as described and I received it promptly. I was very satisfied. <end>  Wow!  Excellent product. My wife was very happy with quality and design. Fast delivery. Highly recommend company. <end>  Great gift!  I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she absolutely loved it! It came in a really cute collectible box, also, which I didn't expect! The shipping was a little slower than expected, but I was overall very satisfied with my purchase! <end>  I bought this as a christmas gift for a friend.  Who has 3 kids and is a single mom, i thought it would be a nice reminder of her family that she could wear to work and things since its not too flashy or expensive. It isn't quite as shiny as the picture led me to believe but it is pretty and simple, eaxctly what i was looking for. <end>  Cute, but cheap looking  I bought this for myself for Christmas, being a mom to 3 kids. Mother pendants can get pretty pricey, and I bought this one because it was cheaper than many of the other ones out there. I got my necklace only a week after ordering it, during the Christmas season, and to an APO box in Italy, I was very happy with the shipping time of this necklace. I put it on immediately after getting it. The chain is pretty short, shorter than I like the chains of my necklaces. The pendant itself feels like it was cheaply made, it has a kind of plastic feel to it and seems like it could snap easily. I went to sleep with it on and the next morning I was attached to my sheet by my necklace. The back clapse popped open and my necklace fell off, I thought that it was broken, but the clapse was just bent a bit. I will be buying a longer and better chain for it. I love my necklace but I don't expect it to last long with a nursing 12 month old.I would recommend this for other mothers, but so long as they know what they are purchasing before they commit to the buy. <end>  Wonderful Christmas Present  I like the Quality of this necklace. It is is beautiful in nature. Very shiny. My mom will love it ! <end>  What mom wouldn't love this  I bought this for myself because I'm so thoughtful of myself. No one in my family would by this for me. But anyway.... I have my three babies with me every where I go. I get compliments on this all the time. I bought one for my stepson to give to his mother. It makes a great mothers day gift. I would recommend to anyone. <end>  GREAT GIFT FOR MOM  I GAVE THIS FIVE STARS It was exactally what was shown!! Packaging was awesome. The necklace and penant was in a plastic bag inside a very nice box, that will make &#34;your &#34; mom wonder what awesome gift she is receving...it doesn't even need to be wrapped .....but for xmas I will wrap it. This is also a great gift for your wife whom has beared your children...this is one of the special gifts that I am urgently waiting for my wife to open...note the cost is great for what you are getting a huge smile from your loved one.... <end>  Absolutely beautiful!!!  I love it!!! This necklace is absolutely beautiful!!! I love it!!! I wear it all the time! Just the perfect size! <end>  mother in law loves her single mother 3 kids necklace  mother in law loves her single mother 3 kids necklace. my husband got it for M-in_L for mother's day. she's very happy with it and wears it all the time. She's not a single mother, and isn't impressed when I call the necklace that. <end>  Mommy gets compliments daily!  This was the perfect Mommy's Day gift. The chain is short, but this way the pendant is more easily shown off. Hit "Add to Cart" NOW!! <end>  My Wife Loves It!  I bought the necklace for my wife for Mother's Day. She loves it. It is beautiful and she wears it daily. The design is perfect with three heads to represent our three sons. <end>  lovely  PUrchased this necklace for myself. I must say it is lovely and very shiny. Would recommend to anyone. Great gift for mothers day, christmas or birthday. <end>  Fantastic  Exactly what i was looking for. shipped and arrived on time. very pleased. I have bought off of amazon many times and each time am pleased with the results. <end>  Even better in person!  I got this necklace for my mom for Christmas, and I can say that I was not disappointed! The necklace is even more beautiful in person! <end>
 B000PAPF14  Calavera (Skull) Cuff Links - Day Of The Dead ||	  good cufflinks  The cufflinks do not look cheesy or cheap. Good quality with an alternative, artistic edge. <end>  very happy with these  i bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them. i wish i could find some day of the dead ones as i would buy them on the spot. great product though <end>
 B000PAQC7K  Sterling Silver Mother-of-Pearl Ring by Sajen, Size 6 ||	  Good deal  I bought this ring for my grandma's birthday. Its a good sized ring, but looked real nice on her ring finger. If your purchasing this for someone with smaller hands I would suggest their index or middle finger as the ring itself is quite large. <end>
 B000PAQC8O  Sterling Silver Marquis Garnet Ring by Sajen, Size 7 ||	  unique, well-made piece  this is a fairly large ring, in height as well as width- it is a unique piece, and i figure if you're the type to be buying it at all, you'll like it. it is not delicate, but stands out, and many people comment on it when i wear it- not always in a complimentary way, exactly, but i like it, and find it beautiful. it looks like the picture, and i wear it alone, on my middle finger. i think it would be a bit busy to wear any other rings with it. it is a tad shiny new, and i'm waiting for the nice burnished coloring that comes with age on silver. i would definitely buy this again. i gave it 4 stars because it's unique enough that i don't wear it with everything, or daily, but only sometimes, with black. <end>  glitter  this is a beautiful piece of jewelry that is both high quality for modest means. A piece anyone would love to own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <end>  Gorgeous ring  I love this ring. The design is fabulous. The stone is beautiful and draws attention immediately <end>
 B000PAQCH0  Sterling Silver Black Star Ring by Sajen, Size 5 ||	  I really have been impresed with Sajen's craftsmanship  This is one of 8 Sajen products that I own and I have been very happy with all my purchases.The ring is well made and feels very "solid". I wear it as a "pinky" ring and I feel it is a great size for that. <end>
 B000PAQE4G  Amazonite Beaded Necklace by Sajen, 23" ||	  Beautiful beads  I love the color of this necklace, it's like clear seawater. It's well made, and weighty, but not heavy. Only thing is it's 23" at the longest point, not at the neck opening and you can't wear a necklace extender with it because it's a toggle closing. But this necklace is an amazing value for little expense! Highly recommended. <end>
 B000PAS4JE  Sterling Silver, Papua Shell, Malachite and Lapis Ring by Sajen, Size 9 ||	  Great product by Sajen!  I love this ring. The perfect match for my abalone (paua shell) collection!Excellent quality. It is reasizable (the base around the finger has a cut so the size can be enlarged if it's needed.) <end>  Nicer than the picture!  The ring is well crafted as all Sajen silver jewelry seems to be as I own several items. I am wearing it on my little finger where it is definitely noticed because of size and design. Love it, purchase recommended... <end>
 B000PAS584  22k Yellow Gold Plated Sterling Silver Ornate Earrings by Sajen ||	  gold plated earrings  Despite being gold plated, these earrings have some weight to them. The hooks are a bit flimsy (as most are) but the plating is done well and offers a nice, bright color without looking fake. Bought these as a gift and the recipient loved them. <end>
 B000PAS5AW  Rutilated Quartz, Tiger Eye, Aventurine and Blue Chalcedony Necklace by Sajen, 54" ||	  long necklace  This necklace is long enough to loop around your neck twice. It looks as pictured and I see no problems with it. <end>
 B000PAS5FM  Sterling Silver Seraphinite Pendant by Sajen ||	  nice pendant  This pendant really is a beautiful work of art. I have been wearing it everyday since I received it in the mail. My only word of caution is that the green stone will be darker than it appears in the stock photo. I thought it would be more of a jade color, but it is a forest green stone. But perhaps other shoppers know their seraphinite better than I. Overall I am very happy,and actually pleasently surprised because the pendant was bigger and heavier than I expected for this price. <end>
 B000PAS5HK  Sterling Silver Carved Bone Face Pendant with Snake Chain by Sajen, 18" ||	  Eye catching pendant....  Every time I wear this pendant I get compliments on it. It's very well made and the face is carved beautifully. I was very pleased with the price I paid as well. I feel this pendant is suitable for both teenaged girls as well as adult women. If you like the unusual in your jewelry you won't go wrong purchasing this item. <end>  Absolutely beautiful  Absolutely beautiful. It's very unique and well made. I have received many compliments and would recommend anyone that is looking at it to go ahead and purchase it, you will not be disappointed. <end>  A Very Cool and Pretty Pendant!  I love it! It has a nice weight to it, and the chain it came with is very nice. The face itself is about the size of a dime ... not too small, not too big. I'm wearing it right now, and it looks great! <end>  Petite, small, delicate, dainty, miniature  This piece if beautifully made. I would even say exquisite. The features are pretty, dainty, and delicate. Unfortunately, it is much smaller than I ever imagined. It looks much larger in the photograph. The description is accurate. Do not make my mistake; check out the dimensions. <end>  UNIQUE AND PRETTY  LOVE THIS PENDANT. I GET MORE COMPLIMENTS ON THIS THAN ANY OTHER JEWELRY I HAVE. I HAD ONE LADY TRY TO BUY IT OFF MY NECK.LOVE IT <end>  Pretty and unique Sajen pendant....  I had been looking at carved face pendant for a while when I came across this one. I just get it a couple days ago and I am pleased with it. The face is so beautifully carved and has the most serene expression. The overall size is about an inch from the tube shaped bail to the bottom edge. Dainty but unique. It is solidly set in sterling silver, and even though it is a smaller piece it has some weight to it. It comes with a great versatile snake chain, but you could change it to many other styles since the bail is so large. I love Sajen's jewelry and hope that Amazon brings in more of their jewelry! Oh and this came in a great velvet bag packed within a gift box, super if you are getting it for a gift! <end>  Very small.  I love Sajen's things. I have a ring from her collection that's just awesome. I guess when I ordered this I was assuming it would be the same caliber. It's a cute little pendant, about the size of the end of my thumb, but I was expecting something much larger. I also found out I do not like snake chains because it keeps wrapping up in my hair. ouch! <end>  Beautiful!  I love this pendant. The face is so lovely and serene. I always get compliments whenever I wear it. It has a nice weight to it and is beautifully crafted. I wear it all the time, it goes with everything. <end>
 B000PAS5JS  Sterling Silver Pink Mother-of-Pearl Circle Earrings by Sajen ||	  pretty as in photo  This earring is exactly as shown in the pictures. Actually I want a smaller one, but it is true to the size as in the description. Very pretty and good for summer. <end>  Love these earrings!  These earrings are great. I got them to wear with a conch shell necklace I have and they are just the right shade of pink. Great summer - beachy - vacation earrings. <end>
 B000PAS5PC  Sterling Silver Titanium Treated Moonstone Dangle Earrings by Sajen ||	  Sterling Silver Titanium Treated Moonstone Dangle Earrings by Sajen  Beautiful earnings, my wife loves them. the moonstones change color with angle/light as you can probably notice in the picture. excellent gift <end>
 B000PAS688  Sterling Silver Scroll Design Quartz Ring by Sajen, Size 6 ||	  not as pictured  disappointing. overly shiny and is adjustable--that may be in the description, but i didn't see it. And though i decided to return the ring, Amazon's return policy made it extremely easy, and best of all--return shipping is free! Thank you, Amazon, you rock!! <end>
 B000PBTNI4  Amazon.com  10K Garnet and Diamond Set  Clothing ||	  loved it  I bought it as a gift for my cousin sister . it was very beautiful . earings are big enough and noticeable.my sister loved it.i wish packaging was little better . the packaging looked little cheap . <end>
 B000PCQ9C6  Large Marquise Stone Diamond Pave Cross Pendant ||	  This cross looks amazing on!  Pave Diamond Oval Blue Topaz Ring in white gold by Zasha Signature JewelryI bought this ring too, and love the way the pieces mix and match. I'm always getting compliments on both pieces, so I wear them all the time. <end>
 B000PCXT1A  10k Yellow Gold Mystic Topaz and Amethyst 4-Stone Ring, Size 6 ||	  Gorgeous Ring! Sturdy Setting! Definitely worth the $$.  As my title says, this ring is beautiful and the setting is solid. Other rings I received with this order had settings that were cheap and flimsy, but this ring has a really solid, beautiful setting. You can wear it with confidence and there's no need to worry the ring will fall apart.The stones sparkle and catch the light. The ring and bracelet make a nice set! <end>  Stunning  This ring is absolutely stunning!! It is so beautiful with the stones. I am so happy that I bought this ring. I get many compliments on it. <end>  Beautiful color  If you like purple, you will love this ring. The amethyst plays off the mystic topaz stones to create a beautiful looking piece of jewelry. The stones are good size too, not to little, or big. The reason I gave it 4 stars is the prong on one side of the ring is sharp and I have to wear it a certain way so it doesn't irritate my finger, otherwise gorgeous ring! <end>
 B000PD1IQC  10k Yellow Gold Smoky Quartz Earrings ||	  Not bad  They're not bad (at least not for the sale price). The stones are fairly sizeable and, as for color, they sort of disappear in my brunette hair. Some people might find that disappointing, but I think it's kinda neat, and they've become a favorite pair.Would've been four star but I dropped a star due to the leverback latches being pretty lousy. On one of the earrings, it's out of alignment and won't snap firmly over the hook. It either ends up beside it, or a few millimeters open. I don't think I'm going to lose the earring because of it, and it certainly doesn't show, but it demonstrates a lack of quality. <end>  Lighter  I was a little dissapointed about the colour of the stone,it's much lighter than the picture,but they look nice and are wearable <end>  earrings  the only thing i was a little disappointed in was the weight of the gold on the clasp. other than that i love them. <end>  Decent Earrings  I received the earrings promptly. They look just as the picture shows them. The stone itself is a decent size and the clasp is actually quite pretty, but slightly weak. Just don't sleep in them. I find that the stone blends in with my hair too easy, so I only wear them with my hair up.The reason I give them 3 stars is because the gold turns my ear black which means shoddy material. I expect that not to happen at that price. <end>  Cheaper quality than they appear  These earrings were a disappointment, especially considering how much they cost. It's too bad too because the stones are actually quite nice  good size, nice color, well cut. But they are set in such cheap findings, they make the earrings appear chintzy. I would pass on these. <end>
 B000PD5GLU  10k Yellow Gold Mystic Topaz and Amethyst Bracelet ||	  Beautiful! Heavy weight, solid stones.  Many times stones are enlarged when you see pictures of jewelry and you're disappointed when they arrive. The pictures for this item are not deceptive---what you see is what you get. The bracelet has nice large, beautiful stones and it's got some weight to it.The stones shine in the light and the bracelet looks beautiful. It's definitely worth the money! <end>  Didn't keep it  I ordered this bracelet because in the picture it looked mostly purple. Well, the stones definitely had a purple AND green hue to them. I do not wear green or particularly like that color, so I sent the bracelet back. This doesn't mean that there was anything wrong with the bracelet, just a matter of personal preference. The stones were a pretty decent size and the bracelet looked OK. <end>
 B000PE2DCY  Golf Trinket Box - Style 37956 ||	  expected it to be bigger  maybe I didn't do my research but it was supper tiny! really cute though! For the price it was fine though and my father in law loved it. <end>
 B000PE6XTI  Sterling Silver Garnet Peridot Topaz Post Earrings ||	  Love them!  I absolutely adore these earrings! They are very unique, and have excellent craftsmanship. The backs tighten very close to the ear, so there are no worries about an earring falling out. The earring is also very well-crafted. I enjoy these very much, and hope that they will be available to the public again soon. <end>
 B000PE8C06  Sterling Silver Celtic Knot and Purple Genuine Amethyst Ring(Sizes 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) ||	  Beautiful  This ring is not too small, not too big, just perfect. The stone is clear and the fit is divine. Very smooth and comfortable. I also have it in the topaz. Great ring for everyday wear. <end>  Absolutely beautiful!  I received this item as a gift, and the pictures here on Amazon don't do its beauty justice. Absolutely gorgeous. Perfect sizing, clear stone, sturdy silver. <end>  Beautiful ring and details  I ordered the Amethyst but received the Garnet. It is still beautiful so I kept it and will reorder the Amethyst. <end>  Mother's Birthstone  This was a gift for my mother who is always looking for jewelry with her birthstone. She's almost 84 and has Alzheimer's and tends to lose things. But at the price it doesn't hurt if she loses it. This ring is attractive and still simple enough for her to wear every day. She loves it and does wear it every day. If she loses it I'll just get her another. <end>  Beautiful  This is one of the best products that I have ordered from Amazon! The company that it was ordered from answered all of my questions and the product was delivered in a very satisfactorily and timely manner! <end>  My favorite ring  )  My husband bought this for me as one of my anniversary presents and I love it. It fits perfectly as sized, no defects in stone or silver. The silver is shiny, the stone is very, very clear - but still definitely purple!  ) The back of the stone does get dirty, as another reviewer noted - as does the back of any stone; a cotton swab takes care of this between more thorough cleanings. <end>  Good low cost ring  Got this amethyst ring for my daughter as a replacement for one we gave her for Christmas several years ago and she literally wore out (band wore through). This ring has a nice solid band than should stand up to a good bit of use. My daughter liked the style and the stone color. <end>  Great ring for the price  Great ring for the price. Bought it for my 12 yr old for Christmas. She loves it. Light purple stone. <end>  Silver ring  Beautiful ring, good quality, stone - nice lilac color, true to size, not too big or small (I do have small hands) <end>  Celtic ring  The rings we ordered are very pretty, but the silver a bit softer then anticipated and was quickly distorted/bent with normal daily wear. <end>  Amethyst ring  I bought this ring for my daughter for her birthday. It is beautiful and she loves the ring. I was completely satisfied with the purchase and delivery of the product. I would recommend this way of buying to others. It was easy, accurate and timely. <end>  lovely ring!  I've always loved amethyst and was worried that rings I ordered online wouldn't fit. But this was a perfect description of the ring and it fits great! <end>  It's perfect  I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She absolutlely loves the ring. It's just as pictured. This was my first time buying from this company and I will probably buy from them again <end>  Very Nice Ring  The ring was a good fit. I wish the amethyst had been a little darker, it's almost lilac in color. Otherwise, I enjoy wearing it very much. Also, it was recieved promptly, in excellent condition. <end>  Nancy  Product worth every penny of the cost. It is very good looking on the person it was purhased for. She is very pleased with it. <end>  Beautiful ring that you will adore!  Since I already purchased (and loved!) the matching earrings to this beautiful ring, I couldn't resist adding this equally gorgeous ring to my Amazon cart.There is no disappointment here. Just like the earrings, this is a lovely piece, and people -- even strangers -- frequently comment on it.Of course, another selling point is the legend that Amethyst is believed to stimulate right-brain activity and psychic intuition. Since I was wearing the earrings at the time I dedided to purchase the ring, I guess I must have made the right decision![...] <end>  Tarnished very easily, within a day or two  The ring tarnished within a day or 2. It left black and green marks around my finger. Initially parts of the ring became less shiny and started looking gray and dull. I would not recommend this to anyone, who is looking for a long time keep sake. Totally not worth the money, considering that it says sterling silver. Any sterling silver I have ever had, never rusted or started to leave black marks. So they are totally fooling you. <end>  Very Unhappy  The ring arrived in good time & looked great, but unfortunately the band/shank bent the first time I wore it - so I've obviously wasted my money. <end>  Amethyst Ring  It was hard to tell size from photo...mine was smaller and more delicate than I thought it was going to be but I was happy with it. I find it is often hard to gauge size from photos (which have been enlarged to show details) and wish sellers would photograph items next to commonly recognized objects (like a quarter or a ruler) to make it easier. Mine was a very pretty well made ring. The amethyst has great color and looks really good in the silver setting. Great price, great size selection, and fast shipping. <end>  Nice, but not "It."  As another reviewer noted, this gemstone is a light lavendar, not the purple described. Still, it is nice. I got my usual size, but it is too big, so I'll have to return it or exchange it. What I do like about this is it is smooth - I mean by that it doesn't catch against cloth or other items. When I put my hands in my pockets to get wallet or keys, etc., some rings catch on the cloth. The smooth feature is what made me choose to try this ring, also it is pretty in design. After purchasing it, I started looking at rings as I shop around, and this ring is superior in quality to any I've seen. It is high quality for its "genre." <end>  OK  This ring is very pretty and it fits great. I was expecting the Amethyst to be darker though (as seen in the picture). So a little disappointment there.  / I was happy with everything else. <end>  Loved It  I bought this ring as a replacement for one my aunt got me that looked similar and I absolutely love it. It's just as pretty as the day I got it and looked just like I expected. Thank you for this, so so much. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a cute ring! <end>  Wish the amethyst was darker....extremely light  Be Warned the amethyst in this ring is extremely extremely light. I was very disappointed when I received the ring since the picture shows a darker amethyst. To see how light the amethyst was google rose de france amethyst (3rd pic) and you get the idea. In addition the amethyst gets dust buildup behind the stone very easily (dulling the color and clarity). I own other amethyst rings and never had the dust buildup affect the color and clarity of the stone before. The cut of this stone is extremely inferior if dust buildup can affect the clarity of the stone this way. I have to wash it almost everyday with a toothbrush to make it shine again. I wish I purchased an amethyst ring elsewhere. <end>  Nice ring for the price  Nice ring for the price. It looks great and it did not tranish so far. I would buy another ring similar to this one. Size was ture as well. <end>  The picture is what you see  Very delicate, very pretty and not a dark purple amethyst. It's a light purple. Very nice. I love it.  ) <end>  The ring arrived today!!!  Love it, love it, love it! It fits perfectly and looks so nice. I will definitely be ordering more Celtic jewelry from you.   ) <end>  Very pretty  I just got my ring. It is very pretty, but the stone seems darker in the picture. The ring seems very sturdy. <end>  cute  bought for a friend. Its cute though i feel the price may be a little over priced for the piece. <end>
 B000PEFXHG  Sterling Silver Thin Twist Threader Earrings ||	  Beautiful ear rings  This threader ear rings are very beautiful. It was a little too long for my short neck so I cut some off <end>  Beautiful  I love these earrings. Just enough twists and turns and the perfect length for me. Very well made. I highly recommend them. <end>
 B000PEHA4K  Sterling Silver Three Color Grandma Heart Locket ||	  Grandma Locket  The sterling silver locket is of the best quality. The engraving on the front is very perfessionally done. A chain did arrive with the locket, although, it did seem like I was going to have to purchase one from the picture on the website. The inside of the locket has a cover to put over the pictures you place inside. The locket opens and closes easily. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The price of the locket was more than other lockets of that size that I viewed, but I liked the engraving on the front, so therefore, I purchased it to put my granddaughters picture in! <end>
 B000PEHA8Q  14K Yellow Gold Medical Id Pendant ||	  Very Satisfied Customer  This is an excellent item, just as described on line. Service was prompt. I will definitely shop at this vendor again. <end>
 B000PEIIZ0  14K Yellow Gold Scapular Medal ||	  the size is smaller than its spec  This medal is delicately made, however the size of the real product is smaller than its description, the length of the medal is 10mm instead of 12mm. <end>
 B000PEILTI  14K Yellow Gold Round St Lucy Pendant Medal ||	  Absolutely love the medal  I received the medal and was very very impressed with it. The craftsmanship is beautiful with all the detailing. The size was small but still very elaborate. And, the chain that came with it was just as impressive, not a cheapy one but a good strong one. I plan to give this medal to my 10yr old niece who was diagnosed with a blind disorder. I am so glad I came across this purchase! <end>
 B000PEIOG8  14k White Gold Moissanite Classic Tiffany Solitaire (.75 cttw equivalent), Size 9 ||	  A Must for brides everywhere!!!  This ring is so beautiful, it's dazzles in the dark!!! The clarity is fabu for the prize. Brides, now and to be, GET THIS RING!!! <end>
 B000PEKR40  14k Yellow Gold 7-7.5mm White Akoya Cultured Pearl Necklace, 18" ||	  Good Pearls for the Price  If you're looking for grade AA or better pearls, buy one of the other necklaces available at Amazon. If you're looking for acceptable Akoyas with cream coloring, medium luster, good roundness and relatively smooth skins at a great price, buy these. Though several pearls have normal surface characteristics and there's no orient to speak of. This is a very good strand; since they're Akoyas, they're worth more than their freshwater counterparts in a price range similar to freshwaters in the 7-7.5 mm range (lowest price on the web).If you have studied information about pearls, you know that Akoyas are much more valuable than freshwaters, due to the difference in production amounts--saltwater pearls (like Akoyas) are produced one at a time within the mollusk vs. twenty to thirty or more per mollusk in freshwater pearls. Also, saltwater pearls (like Akoyas) generally take longer to form within the mollusk.This strand is commercial grade, as is stated in the description (medium luster), yet they're very, VERY nice for the price and definately giftable. <end>  Bad quality  Usually, buying jewelry online is either a HIT or a MISS, i guess in my case this time, it's a miss. Theses pearls were all clearly blemished, and it's very creamy color (NOT LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN, which look like perfect white pearls), the luster is true, medium as stated. However, there were a lot of pearls by the knot were chipped, those pearls looks kinda like it had been cover with cheap nail polish and now starting to peeling off. If you are looking for a pearl necklace to treasure or to show off, this is NOT it. Trust me, spend a couple more hundreds, you can find a much better pearl necklace that you can treasure and be proud of it later. My plastic pearls strand looks way better than this one (which cost me less than $5), and it looks better with my outfit too. <end>
 B000PEKRMW  14k White Gold Moissanite Inside Out Hoop Earrings (2.15 cttw equivalent) ||	  Gorgeous!  I'm delighted with these earrings. They are just beautiful, well-made and come in a pretty wooden box.The product picture makes the gold look dull and the stones look opaque, which is not at all true. The moissanites sparkle beautifully, and are not as tiny as they seem in that picture. I recently bought a pair of 2ct H-I-J/I2 diamond hoops for twice the price from another online store, and I'm going to return them because they look dull and flimsy next to the moissanite pair. Moissanites are more like D-E-F/VVS so a comparable diamond pair would be 3-4 times the price.I'm a moissanite convert. Although I had read about their superior dispersion and luster I still wasn't expecting them to be this lovely. I suppose all those De Beers ads must have had an effect because I was expecting them to have the glassy superficial twinkle of CZs. Not so -- moissanites look more like diamonds than any diamond I've seen outside of a De Beers ad. <end>
 B000PEM76Q  14K Yellow Gold St. Christopher Medal ||	  Very dissapointed  It is so small that it was almost a joke - the charm is too small to wear as an earring <end>
 B000PENSLY  1/10 ct. tw. Journey Diamond Pendant in 10K White Gold ||	  Not as pictured  Item is not as pictured, not nearly as nice. I sent it back and the company said that they had changed suppliers so the item may have changed. Would not recommend buying until they replace the picture so you have a better idea of what you are actually buying. Also did not come with box as advertised. Customer service was helpful but does not make up for the bad situation I was put in just prior to Christmas. Be careful buying from this seller. <end>
 B000PEO7QO  14k Yellow Gold 10-11mm Tahitian Cultured Pearl Stud Earrings ||	  Excellent Value  These earrings were purchased as a gift, and the sale price makes them surprisingly affordable when compared to other, similar Tahitian stud earrings of 10-11mm. The pearls are round. Their nacre is predominantly smooth, although one pearl has a slight dimple which is on the underside. Luster is good (medium). Color is even and well-matched for both pearls--dark gray with hints of green. There is no orient to speak of; pearls with rich orient would cost many times more than the price of these earrings. They arrived in a tiny velvet bag inside of a box with a care card. Because of that and the tiny dimple, I'll keep these. For the money, they're an excellent buy! <end>  Better than expected  I purchased based on the first review of these earrings. The author provided nice details so I thought why not. Of course it helped that Amazon has a good return policy. I cannot articulate luster, roundness, etc. as well as the first reviewer however I can say that I am impressed. The pearls are round and show a deep reflection. They are shinny but do not look like mirrors or a waxed finish. There is a dimple in one pearl but I had to look for it and I figure they are pearls so a natural flaw is okay.The color is closer to the picture on the left of the Amazon page, a deep grey, not black. It is even and well matched. The earrings will be well received as a gift. <end>
 B000PEQOB0  CASA Diamond Accent Heart Pendant 10kt. White Gold ||	  Cute necklace, weak chain  I bought this for my mother as she is a CASA. She said it was very beautiful but that the chain is very thin and will probably break. She is searching for a new chain to wear with it. <end>
 B000PG7G56  Made with Swarovski Elements Nugget Pearl .925 Sterling Silver French Ear Wire Hook 1.5" Long and 0.6" wide Dangle Earrings ||	  nugget earring review  I like these earrings. They're light-weight and I get a lot of compliments on them. They're a little more stiff than I thought they would be from the picture, but other than that, they're just what I expected. Thanks! <end>

 B000PH4Q0S  Earspiral tm 31 GF 14K Gold-filled ||	  Distinctive  I surprised my wife with these after she lost one of a previous, similar pair in the ocean. She loves them and has had many people admire them. They are well made. <end>
 B000PHCE1Q  Ladies White Gold Diamond & Sapphire Circle of Life Pendant Chain ||	  I would give this 0 stars if I could.  This is hands down the WORST purchase I have made on Amazon. I know, I know, you get what you pay for. Yet, I failed to see any mention of the fact that the sapphires would have visible chips, pits and cracks in them (one of the chips covers almost half of the sapphire). This was going to be a gift, but it's such a terrible piece that I can't imagine giving it to anyone. If you are thinking of buying this - save your money. <end>
 B000PHFF7G  Loving Family&reg Large Sterling Silver Pendant with Extender - Mother and 2 Children ||	  Great for me - great as a gift!!  I love this necklace. I actually bought the Loving Family 4 person one first for myself. I loved it, and got so many compliments on it, that we ordered the 3 person one for my mom for Mother's Day. I definitely recommend it.  ) <end>  Wonderful Gift  I was looking for something to buy my sister for her birthday but couldn't figure out what to get her. I came across this on amazon and knew right away she would love it. It was beautiful, I was right. She loved it and never takes it off. <end>
 B000PHH9NY  MOM Forever Crystal & Silver Tennis Bracelet Gift Boxed ||	  Great Bracelet  Its beautiful and sparkly and worth the money. i gave it to my mother in law she loved it!!! but the box is pretty ugly........ its black velvet with a bark blue diagonal ribbon across the front with a little shoe tie bow.....yuck <end>  Wonderful!  More amazing than the photo. I wear it everyday. The clasp isn't tight and I have to be careful not to loose it but I love the quality and workmanship. <end>  Review  Its Awsome My Mother Loves It Thank You Very Much I Love The Product Its Awsome <end>  wow  My mother in law LOVES this bracelet. I was very proud to give it to her as a gift. The box was presentable, and the bracelet was bright and sparkly. the price is unbeatable. <end>  Not that bad but...  This came wrapped beautifully, and the bracelet was as described, but not in the best quality I was expecting. The photo of the bracelet itself was definitely prettier than the product I received. <end>  Bad Review!  I bought this product for my mom for Christmas based off of what the reviews said and by the product description I am completely dissatisfied, after wearing the bracelet twice my moms wrist turned green! And not only did it turn green but the back of the bracelet is now completely brown/copper colored! I would not buy this product I was mis-led about the product and I am very upset because it's not worth anything. The only reason it has one star is because I can't give anything less! <end>  A Great gift for birthdays and Mother's Day  This bracelet is absolutely AMAZING. I ordered it Monday, and came a day early, Wednesday; which was perfect because my mother's birthday was the day it was delivered. The bracelet came in the beautiful jewelry case, totally undamaged. Without a single scratch. The packaging was a little shady though, almost sloppily cased.I give the purchase five stars. I am very satisfied with Mom Forever. The tennis bracelet is worth the money you spend, and compared to my mom's reaction, it was worth anything in the world. <end>  beautiful but not real  I thought this was sterling silver but after my mother-in-law complained that her wrist turned green, i was mortified! Still VERY shiny when I got it and looks beautiful. Better to keep than gift (for the green wrist factor lol) <end>  A nice gift.  This was a great birthday present for my mom. She loves jewelry and this bracelet is just so cute! It's very sparkly and sweet. And it's a bonus that it comes in such a pretty box. It was a great last-minute gift for my mom for her birthday. And a good cheap one too because I am a poor college student and I can't afford to get her much right now. For what it is, it is very nice and I recommend it to anyone looking to get their mom a nice gift when they are hard on cash. <end>  Mom just loved it !!!  the pic doesn't do it justice !The crystals sparkle so much more when she put it on !I charged the crystals to bring her joy and comfort.After Mom passed I began wearing the bracelet.Took a shower with it on to clean it, next morningI noticed a "ring" of green on my arm !!!Sterling silver, I wonder ! <end>  Mom Bracelet  I bought this bracelet for my mother-in-law's birthday. She loves it and thinks it's nice how it just says mom over and over. It's surprising quality for the price and sure to make any mom happy. <end>  LOOKS AMAZING!  I got this for my step mom for christmas and it looks REALLY good! The box was very nice and the quality is simply amazing. <end>  Came Broken!  The bracelet is nice, I gave it to my wife for Christmas. She opens the box, and the bracelet was broken, not cool! Thank goodness for the easy Amazon return policy. <end>  A great gift  Bought this as a Christmas present and did not even have to wrap it. The box is very impressive and the Bracelet itself is very nice. My mom liked it a lot, its a great gift to show you appreciate your mom (not just on mothers day). A Great buy. <end>  Love it  This bracelet looks SO much better in person. Absolutely gorgeous. I bought it for my boyfriend's mom for Christmas and she cried. It looks beautiful in the light. Simply put, I recommend this to anyone trying to find a perfect and affordable Christmas present. <end>  matching necklace  my sister had got my mother the necklace a few years ago. now she has the matching set and loves it <end>  Her daughter's idea, my girlfriend loves it!  Combining her daughter's love and my money, this was an instant hit with my girlfriend on Christmas Day. <end>  it's ok- just ok.  Nothing grand. Looks like the pic but for some reason I didn't like it in person. <end>
 B000PHHYVQ  Round Gold Locket Pendant on 18" Chain Gift Boxed ||	  Cheap  The locket looks really cheap...almost fake. I did buy it as costume jewelry for my stepdaughter...but I expected something of a higher quality... <end>  Very Nice Locket  I was a little hesitant to order this locket as it was to be a gift for someone else, and I wasn't sure of it's quality. I was pleasantly surprised! It is a nice size - not too big, but not super small either. The etched decoration on the outside was very subtle, but feminine.I was able to print out 2 photos to place in either side and get them to fit very easily. It looked beautiful once it was put together and repackaged for our recipient.It was a real hit!!! Our recipient was thrilled and it looks just as pretty on. <end>
 B000PHJ9WI  Loving Family&reg Sterling Silver Large Pendant with Extender - Parents and Child ||	  Too big.  The pendant is very nice, but it is just too big for my taste. I returned it and got the one parent/one child small one. It is beautiful. I love it. <end>
 B000PHJ9X2  Loving Family&reg Large Sterling Silver Pendant Necklace with Extender Featuring a Loving Mother and Her Child ||	  Mothers Day/ Expecting mother  I had bought this for my mom when I was 8 yrs old, I saved up all my pennies and dollars from lunch. I'll never forget the day I gave it to her, she still has it and she still gets compliments on it 11 years later. I had purchased it in gold and it really is a timeless piece of jewelry a great purchase lol. Now I too am looking for this exact same pendant in silver since I'm going to be a new mommy soon. I love this pedant! <end>  Beautiful!!!!  I bought this for my mom for Mothers Day and she absolutely loved it. It is a beautifully made pendant that my mom never wants to take off! I wish they chain itself was of best quality but thats no biggie. Everyone still compliments her on it and she loves that. Great price too, I would definitely buy it again. <end>  Beautiful!  This item was purchased as a gift. It arrived 2 days earlier than expected; the package was in excellent shape. The large size is perfect for a woman who is 5'6" or taller and the figures are beautifully sculpted. It looks much more expensive than it is. The only improvement I could wish for is that the presentation box could be of better quality. Thanks for a great product! <end>  A little too big  I love this necklace and have wanted it for over a year now. I have never seen one like it. I finally splurged and ordered it for myself. My only complaint is that it is too large for a somewhat small framed person like myself. I exchanged it for a small, so I am waiting to see how that will be. Other than that, I love it! <end>
 B000PI92JC  Cartouche Pendant - Made in Egypt - with "FRIEND" in Hieroglyphics - Open Style ||	  Ab Fab!  This was purchased as a gift and was next to perfect. Beautifully designed and crafted. I'd definitely recommend others to buy one. <end>
 B000PJNG20  10k Yellow Gold Emerald and Diamond Heart Pendant (.02 cttw, I-J Color, I3 Clarity) ||	  Good Pendant terrible chain  The chain got all tangled and was to fine to untangle and had to be broken off. I would not reccomend this product unless you have a better chain to use. <end>  Christmas gift  This item was ordered three daysbefore christmas and arrived christmas eve.Beautiful peace of jewelery,i wasvery pleased. THANK YOUPaul G.Osborn <end>
 B000PK1YLE  Boxes  Hand-crafted Wood ||	  Really nice  The box is really nice, I like it a lot. Bought it to hold cards though and the interior dimensions are a little small. 1.9" wide, so it will not work for what I intended, but it's a beautiful box. <end>  Nice for medium-sized decks...  I bought this to hold my tarot deck and it works great for that. The top latches firmly so that the cards won't fallout if you knock the box around a little bit, but there's no lock and it's not made so that you can add a lock of your own. I would have given it 5 stars if it had had a simple lock. If that's not an issue for you, you might want to get this box before they're gone, as it's quite sturdy and very attractive. <end>
 B000PK2GFW  14K White Gold Cable Chain - 18 inches ||	  Very nice quality but seems very fragile  Probably predictable from the price but this necklace is made of very, very thin gold and I'm worried will break without much pulling. Otherwise, it's beautiful. <end>
 B000PKEFA6  Sterling Silver Hollow Bead Chain - 7 inches ||	  A beautiful deal!  I had previously purchased the matching necklace for my wife. The addition of this bracelet raised my spousal approval rating about 200%! She absolutely loved it. <end>
 B000PKEJP2  14K Yellow Gold Solid Rope Chain - 18 inches ||	  Great Rope Chain  DivaDiamonds is a great company. The chain arrived on time. It is real 14 Karat Gold. You can feel the weight of the Necklace. Will buy from them again!!!!! <end>
 B000PKJZB0  1928 Jewelry Teardrop Dangle Earrings ||	  Small and Dainty  I ordered these earrings to match a cameo necklace i purchased on amazon too. The greens matched perfectly. I really love how small and dainty these earrings are. I have long dark hair and they looked great against it. If my ears didn't get annoyed by earrings I would wear these all the time! Very versatile for day or night. <end>  Made a wonderful Christmas Present.  I ordered these earrings for a Christmas present for my niece. They came quickly, nicely packaged, and she loved them. <end>
 B000PKJZI8  1928 Jewelry Brass-Tone Simulated Plastic Pearl and Crystal Necklace ||	  For a very petite lady or a girl only.  I do not like this necklace or the earrings that go with it. Partly my fault, I did not register how tiny they are. "Grace and elegance accentuate this brass colored silhouette." That may be true, but these old eyes would need a magnifying glass to establish the accuracy of that. I am not being sarcastic, please understand. This necklace and earring set is very, very small. This is jewelry that is appropriate for a young girl. For all but the most petite ladies, the proportions would be wrong. I finally found the words I want to use to describe the set  it lacks presence.I am going to give them as a gift to the young, very young, lady next door. On her, they should be in proper proportion to stand out and have presence. <end>
 B000PKJZII  1928 Jewelry Super Stretch Hematite Tone Beaded Bracelet ||	  Dazzling, Trendy Bracelet!  Love this bracelet! I bought different colors and always get comments on how pretty it is. Great for gift giving, and dresses up whatever you're wearing. <end>
 B000PKJZJC  1928 Jewelry Blaze Siam Tone Tri-Sparkle Drop Pendant Necklace ||	  She liked it, but too expensive and slow shipping  Nice necklace. The stone was a little dark and seemed more like a plastic stone in cheap costume jewelry, but the woman receiving it seemed to like it anyway.Do not buy it online if you need it within a couple of weeks. The day after I ordered it, I went to a big chain department store and saw the same thing for half the price. I paid for shipping a product when I could have just picked it up myself. Too make matters worse, the shipping took longer than promised, and did not arrive until after Christmas. So if I had just gone to the store, I would have paid 60% less and had it in time. <end>  Beautiful Piece of Jewelry  I own this necklace and it is stunning. That red just pops. The crystals above the red stone brings out the red even more. Its also adjustable so you can make it just the right length. If you want to make your outfit complete pick up the earrrings that match. <end>
 B000PKJZL0  Tzarina Triple Strand White Simulated Pearl Bracelet ||	  My favorite dress up bracelet  I have some really expensive jewelry, but when I travel I don't like to take the "good" stuff, so I purchased a few pieces of 1928 Jewelry, which I just love. I expected to wear this bracelet on vacations away but I love it so much I find myself wearing it to luncheons and dressy occasions at home too. I get so many complements on it, and no one realizes it's 1928 and not something that costs thousands more. <end>
 B000PKLYNC  1928 Jewelry Jet Black Stud Earrings ||	  not as advertised  From the picture they look like studs, and well it says they're studs, but they're not. They have a huge metal base and are quite ugly, the picture doesn't represent the actual product at all. I can't even give these things away. <end>  Jet Black Stud  I like these earrings. I can wear them in my second hole with any other color of earring. They are so pretty. <end>  great earrings for my man  I bought these for my husband and he loves them. They look great on him too! I think they would look great on me too!The quality is top notch and has the extra security of screw backs. <end>  Love these earrings !  These stud earrings go with everything, I rarely take them off. Wonderful product, shipping was fast, and they were packed in a lovely box. <end>  perfect for work!  I am not allowed to wear dangle-earrings at my job. These were perfect for style AND I was still allowed to wear them with my uniform. Excellent! <end>  Don't bother!  As others have said before, these are huge. Not only this, but the backs are pretty horribly done.I find myself missing both backs after less than a month. How'd they disappear? They fell off while I was sleeping. More than once I found them on my bed, next to me, but there were two times that they just up and disappeared. This is what you call shoddy workmanship.Don't bother with these things, they're a waste of money. <end>  these suck  their much bigger in person really bulky and not flat like they seem in the pic <end>
 B000PKLZ86  1928 Jewelry Topaz-Color Square Drop Earrings ||	  Beautiful earrings  These earrings are subtle and elegant; beautiful brown stones to compliment office attire or evening wear. Can't speak to the shipping experience because I received them as a gift, but I love the earrings. <end>
 B000PKLZAE  1928 Jewelry Jet and Black Crystal Chandelier Earrings ||	  Very pretty  They are very pretty, nice for everyday outfit and night too. One of them came without a little stone, as I live abroad it is not easy to make the return, but in spite of it, they are beautiful. I use them everyday! <end>  beautiful  I love these earrings! I can wear with casual black outfits or more dressy type wear. I highly recommend this. <end>  Grandma Jackie  These earrings are great! Not heavy at all. Have had many compliments. Would recommend to anyone who likes chandelier earrings. <end>  nice pair of earrings  Received the earrings and they were everything as described,very nice, but had to return because who I bought them for cannot wear dangling earrings. <end>
 B000PKLZEA  1928 Jewelry Blue Fashion Cross Necklace ||	  True Blue  I collect crosses, and many are not half as pretty as this one. It has a very antique look to it, and is very different. I am glad they put some lighter blue stones in it along with the dark blue ones. Otherwise, it would be too dark considering the metal has a dark-antique look to it. For the price, it was one of my best buys! <end>
 B000PKNFGG  1928 Jewelry Sparkling Red Geometric Necklace ||	  Red geometric necklace  This was an interesting looking, inexpensive necklace for a teen aged girl. It was a cute, vintage look, and she was quite happy with it. <end>
 B000PKNFUM  Green Gardens Enamel Drop Earrings ||	  Green Garddens 1928 Earrings  The vendor processed and shipped quickly. These are nicely made like so many 1928 products. There is an embossed design on the back. The dangles have a gold tone, it only reflects color. The green "stones" are subtle, and there are 2 accent crystals in a kind of dark turquoise. They will go with a lot of colors, I think.The earwires are comfortable. Great look for the price. <end>
 B000PKPCJO  Classic 30" Faux Pearl Necklace ||	  mem  Advertised as necklace. Arrived in plastic bag with loose pearls and a flimsy string. There was no clasp. Hopefully will get a refund after returning product.Quintessence 8mm 30" Faux Pearl Rope Necklace <end>  String rotted  Classic 30" Faux Pearl NecklaceShould have paid attention to other reviews. Pearls fell out of the bag all over the table. String arrived frayed and deteriorated in several places. Necklace returned. On the plus side Amazon credited my account promptly.Matt <end>
 B000PKPCRG  Dancing Pyramids Sapphire Hues 3x5 Frame ||	  anniversary  I have been hunting for a great anniversary gift for my grandparents when i saw this i thought it wouldn't look that great in person but i just got it and it looks even better and when i gave it to them they loved it so if this is a gift or just for you i recommend that you get it for them or yourself!!! <end>
 B000PKPDCK  Tzarina Crystal Hexagon Necklace ||	  beautiful and delicate, but quality could be improved  This necklace is lacy and light, and I am very happy with it. The only thing I would improve is the quality  some of the tiny stones are not set quite right, and on mine, the antique finish on the metal is a little darker on one side of the chain than on the other. These things are noticeable only if you look VERY closely, so I'll still be wearing it to my sister's wedding. The color of the pearls is very good  they match my real pearl earrings perfectly. A+ for style, B- for quality. <end>
 B000PN24F6  Amazon.com  Rhinestone, Crystal Bead and Chain Necklace and Earring Set  Clothing ||	  very nice  Its a very nice piece , Me and my wife went on a cruise and she wore it to the dining room for dinner and got a complement in the elevator . <end>
 B000POMTI2  Leaves and Large Blue Turquoise Sterling Silver Cuff Bracelet - Native American Style ||	  Beautiful Bracelet  Bought the bracelet for a close friend. It is absolutely beautiful, especially in person. I'm considering purchasing one for myself. If you like turquoise and sterling silver, you will not be disappointed in this purchase. <end>  The bracelet is not very wide for the average wrist  The bracelet is nice, but not wide enough for the average wrist. Shame as the bracelet is good value and the turquoise stone is really pretty. <end>  Not bad  It is a really nice piece. The item shipped quickly and it was exactly what I ordered. It was surprisingly small.. but because it is nearly pure silver, it was flexible enough to have been 'reshaped' mildly to fit her wrist. She wears it and is happy with my selection. <end>  GORGEOUS!!  first of all received this so quickly....and WoW!! it is so beautiful. I am so in awe with the detail and workmanship on this bracelet, I cannot stop stealing glances at it on my wrist. Just an FYI the turquoise stone is a "highly polished" smooth stone, and not your usual raw earthy turqoise stone. <end>  Great gift  Great gift , good quality item , quick delivery . You know a gift is winner when the person receiving it puts it on within 5 seconds of opening it, and has hardly let it out of her sight since she got it. <end>  Absolutely Beautiful!  I wanted this bracelet for a long time. I'm so glad I finally got it. It is stunning. The silver artwork is detailed. The turquoise stone is large and a deep blue. The fit is perfect. Not too small nor is it too large. I'll be buying more from Silver Insanity. <end>  very pretty piece of jewelry  The bracelet is very pretty and the stone is stunning. Is much prettier in person. I have a very small wrist and fits me nicely. Also love the oxidation of the silver, which gives it an antique look. With this look, it gives it more durability. <end>
 B000PPNWOG  14K Yellow Gold 1/5 ct. Diamond "Palm Tree with Crescent Moon" Pendant with Chain ||	  Simply gorgeous  This is my second palm tree necklace like this. The first disappeared somehow and I had to replace it. Its stunning, and I am complimented on it all the time. This particular palm with crescent moon is the state signature for SC. Since moving here, I have become a palm tree addict as well and this is exactly "me". Just love it. Although the chain is slightly thin, for the money you can't beat it. At a retail jewelers near me, I priced one so similiar that you could not tell the difference and they were selling it for $895. I have referred this necklace and Katarina to several of my friends who loved the site as well. <end>  Beautiful but chain is to thin!  I was very impressed with the turn around time from when I ordered this necklace to the time I actually received it. It came within two days. It came packaged in a beautiufl blue box, however the chain was kinked and knotted beyond belief. It took me an hour and my husband and hour to completely get it un-kinked. It was extremely frustating and I kept thinking one of us was going to break the necklace. Overall the piece is beautiful but I am not sure I would order something with a chain that thin again from them. <end>
 B000PQBVAC  Sterling Silver 4mm Round Created White Opal Stone Stud Earrings ||	  very nice looking  these are pretty man made opals. very real looking. i only gave 4 stars because the posts are soldered on kind of crooked. this doesn't matter once you put them on but the workmanship could be better. otherwise i cannot complain. these are a nice addition to my earring collection. <end>
 B000PQG44A  Sterling Silver 4mm Round Created Pink Opal Stud Earrings ||	  Lovely pink little studs  These are lovely little pink speckled studs, small, but they do show up on the ear. Great everyday earring to wear. Good value for money. <end>

 B000PS8BZ8  18K Rose Gold over Sterling Silver Tanzanite CZ 4mm Round Stud Earrings ||	  beautiful little earrings  people the ictures do not do these justice. if you think they look good on the internet wait until you see them in real life. the rose gold overlay is absolutly flawless and the tanzinte cz are full of fire! I absolutly reccomend purchasing from this company! <end>

 B000PU667G  Sterling Silver .925 Genuine Sapphire Stone Oval Small Stud Earrings ||	  sapphire earrings  bought for a gift for next Christmas will let you know if they liked them. they are very nice. thank you <end>
 B000PU7DAU  Sterling Silver .925 Genuine Ruby Stone 4mm round circle stud Earrings ||	  don't buy  Bought this thinking it was silver metal as it says and looks in the picture - it wasn't (actually copperlike in appearance). The Rubies are completely cloudy and poorly cut. It wasn't even worth the $8 dollars and I will not give this my girlfriend - it belongs in the trash. Don't buy. <end>
 B000PUG8P6  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Ruby 5x3mm Oval Stud Earrings ||	  Very Dull  The rubies in these earrings are very dull, and my pair looked crusty like they were not cut properly. I sent them back. <end>
 B000PUH940  14K White Gold Moissanite 3 Stone 3 Prong Design (2.5 cttw equivalent), Size 7 ||	  looks great at the begining  After six months or so one stone turned a yellow coloration and the brightness in general faded. And again the first impression was excelent and for some that's important. <end>
 B000PUH95E  14K White Gold Moissanite 3 Stone 3 Prong Design (2.5 cttw equivalent), Size 9 ||	  looks great at the begining  After six months or so one stone turned a yellow coloration and the brightness in general faded.

 B000PUOR8G  One Silicone Hider Plug Version 1.5  0g, Wearable Length  5/16" (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  Great product...quick delievery  Awesome product, can barely tell I'm wearing them....these look very natural. Would certainly recommend these if you can't wear gauges to work. <end>  Hiders hide things  I ordered a pair of these Silicone Hider plugs because I work in a hospital, and am in a school program where gauges are not allowed. These hide plugs are fantastic. Put them in as soon as I got them to make sure they would work and they were easy to get in, even with the lip on either side of them, due to their flexibility. They match my skin tone well and someone probably wouldnt notice them unless they were looking for them. Thanks so much, they are great! <end>  Very Good Product  Shipped super fast and definitely the right price. These silicone hider plugs matched my skin tone very well; inserted easily due to their being hollow and flexible, yet firm enough to retain their shape. You hardly feel them and almost forget you're pierced with just a casual glance in the mirror. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants to make their gauged ears less noticeable for any reason. <end>
 B000PUS4IU  One Silicone Hider Plug Version 1  7/16", Wearable Length  5/16" (SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. ORDER TWO FOR A PAIR.) ||	  must buy two  I use these for work.I work in the Spa setting and these are a great way to have your gauges and work in my field.light, comfy to wear,easy to clean!~ <end>
 B000PV9OC4  Natural Blue Topaz Briolette Gemstones - Dangling Chain Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  NOT SO NICE  PICTURE IS NICE BUT THE ITEM IS MUCH MORE SMALLER THAN SHOWNI THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY DIFFERENT , TOO MUCH EXPENSIVE <end>
 B000PVCR0K  Curved Kidney Bean Shaped Sterling Silver Hook Earrings ||	  Beautiful in person! Great Quality Material!  I put these on my Wish List over a year ago. My boyfriend bought them for me as a birthday/anniversary gift. These are great earrings. I've had some bad luck ordering jewelry online. Often I've gotten poor quality/plated metals or earrings that look cheap in person.Overall, these earrings look as nice as the photo, are a good weight (not too heavy or awkwardly light), nice size/length and look to be solid materials (sterling as described). <end>  My favorite earrings.  I loved these earrings so much they quickly became my favorite. But then I lost one during a Journey tribute concert.  ( Maybe I will order them again if I can once again justify getting something for myself, I have two children so it is a rare occurance. Until then I will look at my one remaining earring and take a moment to reflect on how sad both the Journey tribute band and the loss of my favorite earring was.The quality of these earrings were so worth the price, it really is a steal. Lightweight, beautiful and I had so many compliments on them. They were delivered quickly. I did not expect such great quality for such a low price. Now I must stop talking about them because it makes me sad that they will no longer grace my lonley earlobes. <end>  love them  these are beautiful, light weight, many compliments from others. great earrings for the price. <end>  Gave them as a gift  I gave them as a gift and I'm assuming they are well loved, she wears all the time. ;-) <end>  Great Earrings  These are great, very light, but look really nice (not cheap). Hard to tell they are knockoffs! <end>  Curved Kidney Bean Shaped Sterling Silver Hook Earrings  The order arrived before expected and as always the earrings were nice and easy to put, they're light so you won't notice you're wearing them <end>  Kidney Bean Earrings  These earrings looked much better on the website than they do in real life. They are quite bigger than I expected and the hook part of the earring is very long & can look a bit strange because of it. One of the earrings had a deep gouge in it, but it isn't too noticeable unless you look at it closely. I guess I was hoping they would be nicer, but I do plan on keeping them. <end>  cute and inexpensive  I bought these for my mom for Mother's Day and she loves them! Very cute and understated earrings. <end>  really nice  I wasn't sure what to expect, but these are made from a very nice smooth silter they are practically seamless and they don't weigh a lot. And these are the perfect in between earrings not too big and not too small. <end>  High quality but too long  I had a similar pair that i loved but this pair is way too long. Catches on lots of things. Good quality silver. <end>  just perfect!!!!  super fast shipping.The Item as described, worth every penny, doesn't look cheap, for day or night.these are the perfect size, not heavy, they stay in place. <end>  Pretty!  These earrings are sturdy. I mention this because I've had a few pairs of this style from different stores and they all break at the hook part of the earring. But I think these will last longer because they seem to be a bit thicker.I was a bit disappointed when I saw them for the first time because they had black gooey spots on them both. I had to take my fingernail at scrape off the spots. Kinda gross...The shipping was very fast and the packaging was very well done! <end>
 B000PVP29I  Sterling Silver Red Spiny Oyster Shell Button Earrings ||	  Confirmation-- these are a good find  These earrings are just as pretty as shown. I am pleased with this purchase and feel they were well worth the price. <end>
 B000PWDOT2  Elegant Sterling Silver CZ Crown Pendant ||	  So much prettier in real life!  I love this necklace! It is SO much prettier when you actually get it than it is in the picture.

She loved it and it looked better than the photos. <end>
 B000PWVSLS  Picture Jasper with Jade and Citrine Earrings ||	  Bland  The picture reflects a warm, coffee bean brown color for the jasper. I understand that natural stones vary a great deal in color, but the jasper (the largest stone) in my earrings was the color of oatmeal, with a few dark brown flecks. I can wear them with beige clothing, but they are not what I expected, based on the picture. <end>
 B000PWXEZ6  Aztec Calendar Earrings ||	  Adorable  Love them, they are exactly how they appear in the picture and are very cute. <end>
 B000PWZSZU  Toe Ring - Sterling Silver 4 Sparkling Diamond-like Stones Adjustable Toe Ring ||	  broken!  usually very happy with amazon....i ordered 2 of these, one was fine, the other one had been broken and glued together and needless to say broke within hours of wearing it...  -( sad. <end>
 B000PX2TYM  Ear Cuff- 3-ring Black Ball Stainless Steel Non Pierced Clip ||	  It's ok for the price  It's not really as it's pictured. It's made a lot thinner and a bit difficult to put on and very painful if you happen to bump your ear with it on. <end>
 B000PXZMS2  18K Gold over Sterling Silver Created White Opal 6mm Round Stud Earrings ||	  Ehh  really nice. Delivered on time. Same color. Just expected them to be bigger .

 B000PZ9G78  Peach Pink AAA Cultured Pearl Strand Platinum Overlay Sterling Silver Choker Necklace, Bracelet & Earrings Set ||	  My wife loved them  Very happy with the look and the quality. My wife noted that the string was knotted, and we were pleased that the lovely flower-shaped clasp was coated to avoid tarnishing. She's still having fun wearing variations on the set (wore just the earrings and bracelet today without the necklace).I had been concerned that the 18" "princess" length might be too short, but it turned out to be the perfect length for her. <end>
 B000PZB55Y  Mother of Pearl Flower Turquoise Carnelian Garnet & Swarovski Crystals 18k Yellow Gold Overlay Sterling Silver Hoop Earrings ||	  Fabulous  All I have to say is, "outstanding". I ordered theses earrings as a birthday gift for my sister. I thought they were really unique, great colors, and would suit her features. The earrings were way beyond my expectations, and my sister loved them.The earrings are absolutely wonderful, versatile, elegant, chic, and modern. They compliment all attire genres, from business to evening, to the weekend jeans look.Even the packaging was great, very stylish. My sister and I were really impressed and we will both order from Dahlia again. I highly recommend Dahlia for anyone looking for a gift, especially for the upcoming holidays, or just wanting to purchase something for you. <end>
 B000PZB5MW  Enhanced Black Cultured Pearl Necklace Strand Platinum Overlay Sterling Silver, Bracelet & Earrings Set ||	  STAY AWAY! Look like painted pearls - with paint peeling off!  These look great in the picture online but in reality the pearls look like they were covered with a black coat of paint and was peeling off in some parts. The packing also looked old. Disappointing. Probably the seller sent me a bad product. I had to go through some trouble with the seller to get a return shipping label. <end>  Roger Garrelts  I bought this matching set as a gift for my wife. I had never heard of Dahlia, but it turned out to be everything that I had hoped it would. I will do business with them again. <end>  A very great deal  I was very impressed with the item. The look of the pearls is amazing. The clasp looks great and is much better than a normal clasp. A very elegant yet affordable set. <end>
 B000PZC9C2  White AAA Cultured Pearl Strand Platinum Overlay Sterling Silver Necklace, Bracelet & Earrings Set ||	  Pearl Set  The product and service were outstanding! The product arrived on time and the pearls were of excellent quality. Ladies, I would recommend this as a perfect gift to yourself, and gentlemen...this is a great gift for that special someone. <end>  A surprise gift for my wife  http //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PZEDHQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis pearl set exceeded my expectations. It arrived earlier than promised, in two lovely gift boxes and was simply beautiful.....my wife loved them.....excellent purchase. <end>  Beautiful Just Beautiful!  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, 2008. They absolutely surpassed my expectations! They are indeed flawless and BEAUTIFUL! Even the packaging is drop dead gorgeous! I HIGHLY recommend these as an exquisite gift, the color, the shape, the quality of the pearls are just beautiful. You WILL NOT be disappointed....and no I am NOT a paid spokesman, I don't even play one on TV I am just a very grateful Mom who wants you to know that I am VERY satisfied with this purchase. <end>  Very pleased, and excellent service  I purchased these pearls to wear for my wedding. I needed a just slightly off-white color, as my dress was a 'soft white' rather than pure white. Let me say first that I was blown away by the great customer service from this company. They worked with me to match the color of the pearls that were on my dress, and were very kind and willing to help. They let me return a set that wasn't quite the right color for me, along with a pearl bead from my dress, and then they sent me a new set that was their closest match to the bead. GREAT GREAT GREAT to work with. I was very thankful.The pearls ended up working perfectly. I was VERY pleased with the color, weight, quality, and feel of the pearls. They just feel good to touch and wear!! In addition, I love the silver flower-shaped clasp on the bracelet and necklace. It works well and feels secure. I ended up buying an inexpensive pair of earrings to go with them because I wanted something that dangled, but am still glad to have the simple earrings that came with it as well. I loved wearing this for my wedding, and still love wearing it for various occasions throughout the year. These will be something that I will cherish and always enjoy wearing. <end>  Pearl Necklace, Braclet and Earrings  The Necklace looks better than it did in the photo, my Daughter loved them. She wears only silver so the overlay of Sterling Silver made her like them even more, it was a wonderful addition to her jewerly. <end>  Nice Pearls  My wife loved them. They are nice pearls - each one looks just a bit differnet giving the jewelry a natural look. Her wrist is average size - about 7 inches / 18 cm around and the bracelet fit fine. <end>  If only . . .  The only reason why this is not 5 stars is because the earrings did not match the necklace and bracelet. Other then that, the product is amazing! <end>  Nice but bracelet too small  Nice set but the bracelet is very small and does not fit on the average adult female wrist. Item was returned. <end>  Looks good  i bought this set as a gift for my wife. After looking around at similar and higher priced pearls at local stores these just looked better. Hope she likes them, but I know she will. <end>  Wedding Gift  I bought these as a gift for my wife to wear on our wedding day, not only did she look gorgeous but she was quite fond of these pearls to boot! <end>  Quality at a good price.  I ordered this set for my Niece's sweet 16th birthday after looking at the over-priced Pearls at the Mall jewelry stores and the junk at Wal-Mart,K-Mart, etc... My Niece loved the set and my Sister and Mom agreed that the Pearls were of very good quality and brilliance. The hasp is of good quality and the Pearls have a nice iridescent shine to them. If you are looking for a Pearl Necklace set for a lady to last a life time choose the same company's 7-8mm 0r even the 9-10mm set in at least 18" length. I am purchasing the 9-10mm set for my wife's birthday and for $285 you can't beat the price. Will write seperate review for this set when it arrives. <end>  Pearls  I don't know anything about pearls, but this seems like a really nice set. The necklace has a nice weight to it that surprised me. Some of the pearls are not perfectly round, but I think that gives this set more character. They aren't completely lopsided, just a little out of round. I honestly think if you want to spend a ton of money on perfectly round pearls, you might as well just spend a couple dollars on round plastic beads. I also really like the rose clasp on the necklace and bracelet. Everything came in a pretty little box that is lined with some sort of silky fabric. The only small complaint I have is that the necklace, bracelet, and earrings were all jumbled up in the box from shipping. Not tangled, just piled up. I don't know how fragile pearls are, but maybe each piece should have been individually packaged to avoid damage? None of the pearls seem damaged, so I guess they are tough enough. Regardless, this is a beautiful set that my fianc&eacute;e will be getting in about a week. I know she's going to love them! I would definitely recommend this beautiful affordable set. <end>  Good Quality at a Great Price  I ordered this set for my wife and she loved it. I'm no expert on jewelry but the quality seems really good, all the pearls look nice and they come in a nice gift box. I was worried about the bracelet fitting because there is no sizing option for it, but it fit fine. Shipping was fast. The next time I need jewelry I'll be buying from Dahlia. <end>  Incoherence  I ordered this pearl necklace, bracelet, and earrings set for my young daughter, who was very pleased with it. However, I have just noticed an incoherence between the impressive sales pitch for the set and the Product Specification which in this context seemingly points to a lesser value. Product Sales Pitch  White 7-8mm AAA Cultured Pearl Strand Princess Necklace 18", Bracelet LS1R2 & AAAA Earrings LS1B Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Set (which for some unexplained reason makes no claim about rating of bracelet pearls). Product Specification  lacks any reference to quality categories (in pearls, AAA and AAAA, in metals, Platinum Overlay, and makes no distinction at all between pearl quality between each item in the set.) I think it behooves Amazon.com to explain why these incoherence. <end>  Great quality, price could be better  Got this for my wife upon the birth of our first child. I could probably have gotten it for a fair amount cheaper on a 'dealz' website (I paid around $120 for the set here) but I appreciate the high quality of pearls shown. For me it was worth a bit more money to get the guarantee of quality merchandise. The description and photos I found to be extremely accurate.Also, my wife absolutely loved them. <end>  I love my pearls!  I love these pearls! They are slightly bigger than what I expected, so I have to get over the feeling I'm wearing my mother's pearls, if you know what I am saying. They do look beautiful though and make quite a statement. <end>  Great buy!!  So far my best buy off of Amazon. Arrived in cute, little boxes and when opened they did not disapoint. My wife loves these beautiful pearls. Well worth the money! <end>  Very pleased with this set  I bought this set as a gift for my daughter. She loved it! It's a very nice and classy set. Pearls are white and bright, nicely shaped, not to big or too small, exactly what I was looking for. Delivery was faster than expected. Overall, very pleased with this product and this company. <end>  Pleased  I was pleased with this product. I have ordered from Dahlia in the past & will order again. <end>  Pearl Set  Would recommend this seller, fast shipping arrived really fast to the UK (even know it was thanksgiving over there). Product quality is really good and communication from seller was excellant. <end>
 B000PZEDD0  Enhanced Black Cultured Pearl Necklace Strand Platinum Overlay Sterling Silver, Bracelet & Earrings Set ||	  STAY AWAY! Look like painted pearls - with paint peeling off!  These look great in the picture online but in reality the pearls look like they were covered with a black coat of paint and was peeling off in some parts. The packing also looked old. Disappointing. Probably the seller sent me a bad product. I had to go through some trouble with the seller to get a return shipping label. <end>  Roger Garrelts  I bought this matching set as a gift for my wife. I had never heard of Dahlia, but it turned out to be everything that I had hoped it would. I will do business with them again. <end>  A very great deal  I was very impressed with the item. The look of the pearls is amazing. The clasp looks great and is much better than a normal clasp. A very elegant yet affordable set. <end>

Very comfortable and pretty to look at, yet sturdy. I've received many compliments, and would most definitely recommend it. <end>  Sparkly and Beautiful  This ring is beautiful, yet simple.

 B000Q74FIK  Sterling Silver 1 Inch Long and 1/2 Inch Wide Slithering Snake Designed Polished Finish Band Ring Size 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ||	  Mixed Review  I love the look of this ring and the price was right, but after having it for about a month it now leaves a green mark on my daughter's finger. If I buy her another snake ring I'll look somewhere else and pay a bit more to give her something nicer. <end>  Great item!  The sizing of the ring is a perfect fit. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the ring does look better than its picture; it's shinier. Definitely recommended. <end>  Awesome  I love the snake ring. It is in Excellent condition and arrived on time.I get lots of compliments on this ring.I would order from them again. <end>  Beautifully made  This is a very beautiful piece of jewelry. I love the details, it is very well made ! I am very happy I found exactly what I wanted. <end>  SNAKE RING  Purchased this snake ring for my niece. The ring is MUCH better looking than the picture. The silver is bright and smooth. the decorative touches are just right. It arrived very quickly and the packaging was good. I like it myself. With this quality and reasonable pricing I am sure I will order more items. <end>  Bent then BROKE the first day  There are some other snake rings here that are great. This one is very misleading. My girlfriend tried it on, it was very maliable and was like almost a paper clip is the best explanation I can give you. it bent when she delicately slipped it on and it broke in half when she took it off to wash her hands. DO NOT BUY!!! I'd seriously take a good look at the seller and be careful with their other products. Couldn't be worse. Also they refused to take it back and said thats the way .925 sterling is, sometimes it "breaks" unbelievable!! <end>  Excellent quality, looks great too!  Love this ring, fantastic deal. don't worry about sizing as much because you can adjust it. I wear it as a pinky ring ) sterling silver...why get the cheap metal and spend more? <end>  Cool Snake Ring  If you're looking for something related to Snake, and you want to put it on anytime,then, this is one of the best items.its' size is adjustable and looks better for both of men and women.I really liked it. <end>  Prettyyyy.  i love it, fits right, looks good. I like how it has very intricate detail plus with the great price!i hope i don't lose it! lol <end>  The ring is even cuter in person!  I looked all over the internet for a snake ring that wasn't too big or too small. This ring fit the bill. I couldn't tell if it was going to be cheap looking once it arrived because the price was so good. I was pleasantly surprised. It was fabulous. It looks great on my hand and has a really pretty shine & sparkle to it that you can't see in the picture. It actually looks quite a bit more expensive then it is, which is always nice. I absolutely love it! The compliments keep rolling in... <end>  LOVE THE SNAKE!  This ring arrived very quickly, in a beautiful box and the ring is GORGEOUS!!! Very shiny, perfect size(length wise) and although I did not realize it was adjustable, it actually comes in handy. Very happy with this ring, wear it on a daily basis with my other snake rings ) <end>  Great Value!  I get so many compliments on this ring. I never take it off. It's carved details are perfect and it can easily be adjusted for those days when, as all of us women know, we retain fluids. I love the ring and Gem Avenue is my favorite place to shop for very reasonably priced sterling silver jewelry. I have already recommended it to others! <end>
 B000Q79PR6  Green Jade Color Lovely Band Gemstone Ring Sz 4.5 to 11Size 4.5 ||	  ADORABLE GENUINE GREEN JADE BAND GEMSTONE RING  WISH I KNEW WHAT MM IT WAS 6MM OR 5MM. ANYWAY PRODUCT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY NICE AND SAFE AND IT IS A VERY NICE RING. <end>  Green Jade Band  The ring arrived on schedule, packaged in a nice gift box. It is just as I expected. Very nice! <end>  Green Jade ring  Jade, and especially nephrite jade, is a stone of Heavens, that help you to get Power of Cosmic Forces if you possesses it. All Chinese Emperors knew this and all Great Seals were made on Jade base, it was valuated much more than Silver or Gold. But some people had taught ancient Chinese, Mayas, Sumerians and Egiptians, all of whom sacred Jade. And only jade today is a trace of this teachings. <end>  Beautiful, but fragile!  The ring is beautiful, looks even better than the pictures on the site and me and my wife loved them. We got a matching pair. Hers is still on her finger after a couple of months, mine - sadly - shattered when I caught a key-ring tossed at me. Not even a big keyring, just a loop with a couple of keys... in other words, handle with extreme care. If you want to keep your ring in once piece, you will have to forever be mindful of not getting it struck with anything. Well worth the money though! <end>  green jade ring  The ring color is darker than anticipated and simply beautiful. The s/h and delivery was speedy and securely packaged. Realizing how delicate this material is, I am being extra cautious so as not to break it. <end>  It is so fragile.  The ring lasted 2 days, it fell on the ground and split into two peices.If you buy this ring handle it with care. <end>  not genuine jade  This product is not genuine jade. The ring fell on the floor and broke in pieces. I have more jade jewerly that I tested throwing on the floor and nothing happend to them. I asked an oriental lady from my building that she has real jade jewerly, and she told me that the ring was not genuine jade it was a fake.... <end>  Jade ring_ladies  The color was fantastic but I was a little shocked at the thickness. It is at least 6 mm high so if you looking for something flatter I would not purchase the ring. Its great for a fun ring, for children or to put on a chain. <end>  Really Lovely  This ring was even lovelier on my friend's finger than shown in the pictures. It was well packaged and arrived very quickly, which was nice, since it was a last-minute gift. The sizing is also very accurate. So far she's been careful not to bang it on anything. I have a suspicion she's going to put all the other colors on her Amazon Wish List too!kat in sNJ <end>  breakable!  When you're reading the the name of this product keep in mind 'Green Jade COLOR' the ring is actually made of glass.. That is why it is so breakable. I loved the color of it though and because i was very careful with it. The ring lasted a little over 8 months. Yet sadly it broke right in half. Ye what do you truely expect for the price, you're not buying high end jewelry. <end>  Nice ring  I loved this ring, it cracked into few pieces the first time I wore it. <end>  beautiful  I found this ring to be beautiful and not fragile at all it is very sturdy. <end>  Beautiful green jade ring  This is a fantastic and beautiful bright green jade ring. I bought it for anniversary present in December and have often worn it since. I am mindful of the delicacy of it being jade, but I work in a tools store and it has managed to hold up under some pretty intense work conditions with a lot of bumping and being hit by hard objects. I have had many compliments on it. I absolutely adore it! <end>

 B000Q89EJ4  Sapphire and CZ Stackable Eternity Band ||	  lovely  I was a bit trepidatious about buying jewelry online, but this proved my fears unfounded. It was really beautiful in person. I bought it as a gift for a friend. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the gift box. It was just a small white box, not a ring box. I bought a real ring gift box to present it to my friend, it made it look ten times better. <end>  Very pretty, good value  I brought this ring because I love the look of sapphires. It's too pretty to pass up. The size is a little big, I got a 7 I believe but it's a nice little ring. <end>

 B000Q8E3LS  Stainless Steel Poker Ring - Clearance Final Sale ||	  Doesn't look as pictured  It doesn't look as bold, substantial and shiny as the picture. It's more dull, somewhat like brushed metal, and thinner. Nice ring overall, though. But don't expect too much. <end>
 B000Q8LNAM  Sterling Silver Marquise Shaped Amethyst Cubic Zirconia with Solitaire Celtic Endless Knot Design Polished Finish 2mm Band Ring Size 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ||	  A really pretty ring.  I ordered this ring and another exactly like it in another stone color. Both came in a shiny little box. One was heart shaped and the other was a traditional square box. Both had tiny matching bows on top too. It was cute already and I had not even opened the box. I was very happy when I opened them. The stones are beautiful and the Celtic design on each side is well defiined yet delicate. Excellent presentation, beautiful sterling silver ring, and a reasonable price. Could not ask for more. <end>  1 of Celtic knot Amethyst CZ Marquise 925 Silver Ring Size 4 [ASIN  B000QG5T3G]  I ordered this ring not only because it's a hard to find size that I can't find locally but because it's beautiful & the quality of this ring is outstanding! I am very hard on my jewlery & this ring won't loose it's shape because it is so well made. Also I love the quality & color of the stone as well. I'm very happy I found someone who sells this quality of merchandise. Thank you! <end>  A lot nicer than you would think for the price!  Bought this for my wife and I was impressed because it is a very nice ring and looks like it would sell for twice as much. She liked it very much and is also pleased with the detail and quality of this ring. <end>  Its a Steal.  Bought It As a Gift for my gf who is 16. She really liked it. Its A Unique design and the stone is ok. She Was very happy either way with the quality, design and color choice. Thank You <end>  Extremely nice ring  Ordered this ring for my granddaughter. She was thrilled and we were very impressed with the quality and looks of it. Very well made, beautiful stone and setting. Extremely nice and well worth the reasonable price. I highly recommend this ring to anyone. Lots of sparkle and very impressive. <end>  Great gift!  Value is the word! These rings are gorgeous and the price is great! I bought this for my 16 year old daughter. It has remained shiny and beautiful. The packaging was so nice, shiny gold boxes with pink or green bows. Very nice for any age! So glad to have found this product for an incredible price! <end>  Pretty in Purple  I ordered this ring for my son's girlfriend. The picture is a good likeness, a simple, cute ring - a pretty good value for the money. No knockout, but real cute. I would purchase from Silver Insanity again. <end>  I love this ring!  This order was effortless and rewarding. I got a beautiful ring in the cutest little box. I got it timely and in perfect condition. I would order from Gem Avenue again in a heartbeat. The ring is perfect for work and fun! <end>  Pleasantly surprised  This is a very nice looking piece of jewelery. I ordered at it Christmas for my 11 y/o daughter and she loves it. It is not flimsy at all and looks way more expensive than what it cost me. The gift box was perfect, I didn't even have to wrap it. At present I plan to order two other pieces from this seller for her birthday. <end>  Maybe it was the light...  But I didn't think this ring was as purple as every says. To me, the colouring was more grey-tinged. The person I got it for loved it, however. I thought Gem Avenue's other stone for this ring, the aqua one, looked more realistic. Still, I'll order from them again. <end>  Best Buys  I love this ring. I have purchased more than one item of jewlery from Amazon and love. I will be purchasing more in the future, weather it be for me or as a gift. <end>  Beautiful  This ring has a lot of sparkle. The aqua stone is rather light in color, but even so the ring is really beautiful. What I do like is the size of the ring. I usually take a half size, but most rings only come in the whole size. This does fit me like the half size and it doesn't roll around your finger all the time. The price was exceptional. You can not go wrong in buying this ring. <end>  Very wearable  I wear this ring almost every day. I get compliments all the time. They can't believe how much I paid for it, so I have stopped telling them. <end>  Gorgeous!  I bought this ring as a gift for a friend and was very tempted to keep it for myself! It arrived very quickly and when I opened it (it came in a cute little gift box) I was very pleased to see that it looked even better than it did in the photograph. The details are great, and the gem was set perfectly. I will most likely be purchasing this again, except for myself this time. <end>  stunning!  This ring is gorgeous. Casual yet looks beautiful enough to wear formal. I bought this ring for my mom for christmas and she loves this ring so much. I cannot believe the price I paid for a ring with such nice quality and sturdiness. <end>  very pretty ring  This was a very pretty ring with a nice amethyst. The celtic design matches my wedding ring very well. <end>  Very Happy  I bought this item and another ring similar) for my twin girls. The quality was excellent and the price was too. They LOVED their rings. Thanks! <end>  Wow  My Daughter loves this ring. The shipping was very fast even at Christmas. I will be shopping with these guys again. <end>  love it  I got 2 of these for my daughters. It's been a year and they are holding up great. I need to polish with a silver polish cloth from time to time, but I am very pleased with this ring. I would buy it again. <end>  Perfect!  The item was very beautiful and arrived in excellent shape and fast. Very happy with this purchase and seller. I have shown it off and people loved it. Especially for the price. Would order again in future. 5 stars!  ) <end>  Very Nice  It is a very nice ring. The size of the stone is just right. The details of the knot are so well done. It is my favorite ring. <end>  Beautiful Ring!  I love this ring, I've bought several recently and this one is my favorite. The design and detail is beautiful and it's very well-crafted, the sterling silver is nicely polished. Incredible price for the quality and value of this ring! <end>  Very beautiful and stunning ring!  I was so very impressed with the authentic looks and stunning beauty of the first celtic ring I ordered, that I subsequently went ahead and purchased a second one! I can't give enough praise to the jewelers for their work. Cubic Zirconia looks so very much like the real thing----I simply can't tell the difference. And this company provides such prompt shipping and delivery. This implies a great deal of concern about making certain customers are happy with their purchase!And the price is so very reasonable! Plus your ring comes in the cutest, shiny, little box with a bow on it! I received a gold, heart-shaped box, and a square-shaped, shiny, pink box!Try this place...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! <end>  Updated  When I ordered this ring I knew I would love it. The color is beautiful and matches my purple nail polish. I also bought a pendant to match and they look great together. I looked at some of the other rings and am seriously considering getting another one.EDIT  I really don't know how long I've had this ring, but I'd estimate that it's been a year and 8 months. Early on the band bent and it has turned black in several places. I thought I'd give everyone a heads up. I was looking for a replacement and it irritated me that no one thought to go back and write about how the ring was doing a year or even a few months after the purchase. <end>  Perfect!  I love this ring. The detail with the trinity on each side adds that little something. The Amethyst coloring is just beautiful. I get compliments all of the time! <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring appears to be much more expensive than it actually is! Excellent quality! Stone is just beautiful & the silver is smooth and weighty...feels nice on your hand. <end>  pretty  so i got this ring for my other good friend and she loved the color. its perfect for teenage girls. <end>  very cute but.....  I dont know about you, but I have NEVER had a Sterling Silver ring turn my finger green. so I am not even sure if they are really sterling silver. I will not be buying any of these rings again. <end>  WOW!  I LOVE THIS RING! Its beautiful! The shipping came on the first day! The ring is a bit lighter color of purple Amethyst shown in the picture, and the stone does not come out over the setting (it's almost sunk in the setting) but it's a LOVELY ring for the price. I WILL BE DOING BUSINESS AGAIN! <end>  Really beautiful ring!  This Celtic knot ring with the amethyst CZ marquise is just as beautiful as the photo. I was really pleased with this ring when it arrived, it was exactly as I expected. <end>  light amethyst  a lighter shade of purple than i prefer in my amethysts, but a nice enough ring to add to my collection... has maintained it's shine for several weeks and gets a fair number of compliments when i wear it... true to size, arrived sooner than expected; i've purchased from this seller before and likely will again... <end>  not as big or dark as i thought  i like the shape and style of the ring but i was slightly disappointed in how small it is in person compared to how it looks online, also i usually enjoy darker amethysts than this one, but overall the product came on time and i do like it. <end>

 B000Q9208K  Sterling Silver Heart Charm Toddler Bracelet ||	  Great for my little 2 year old!  I personally haven't seen this item. I am deployed to Afghanistan. However, my wife has told me all about it, and said it was slightly too big for my little girl's wrist, but it has an adjustable clasp so she could make it fit. Which is great, my daughter can wear this 2nd year birthday gift for a few years now! She told me that it is beautiful and great for my baby. My daughter was at first a little confused by the dangling hearts, but now she adores them, and tells everyone that it is her "Dada Pretty"I higly reccomend this item for anyone who has a little princess like mine! <end>

I am glad I added it to my jewelry and ring collection. <end>  Just ordered ring  So I ordered this ring a couple days ago, I have yet to see it, and was just wanting to know if anyone else has ordered it wondering about the quality. ^_^ <end>  best ring  after losing my favorite claddagh ring, i finally found this one and decided to purchase it. i love it! i was scared it would come and be big and bulky but its small and dainty and i love it. plus, it came in the cutest little box. very happy with my purchase. <end>  A nice ring  Great packaging, and arrived very fast. As for the quality of the product it is very shiny and clean, but the only one thing that I didn't like was that the small grooves by the heart had some thing black in it, and that just marred the clean looked. But over all the design is pretty. <end>  Cute but TINY!  I just got this ring today and I'd say it's 'okay.' It was definately not what I had expected, but it still is a cute ring. I loved the symbolism behind the ring, but I'd have to say it is MUCH MUCH MUCH smaller than what I expected it would be. It is very pretty but it should be made a bit bigger. You can barely see the intricate design. Overall, it's okay. <end>   )  This ring is nice, it's just what it looks like in the picture. I wore it everyday for since I got it, but the silver plating starting to come off and it started to turn my finger green. I figure, if you don't wear the ring every minute of every day, it'll be fine though. <end>  Well worth the money =]  My brother got this for me for Christmas. It's the prettiest little ring!! I'm wearing it on my thumb right now, just like I do everyday. The detail on it is really great and I love the variation with the celtic knots. It's not so overwhelming that I can't wear it with other rings. I get tons of compliments!!! <end>  Not traditional  My daughter lost her Claddagh ring and waited for years for a new one. I purchased this for her birthday and she loved it. Its design is different from the traditional hands holding the heart but replaced with a the celtic knot of love and trinity instead. Beautiful! Great quality! <end>  Beautiful  This ring is SO much prettier in person than the picture shows! Nice and shiny and perfect true to size fit! <end>  Perfect for what I wanted  The ring is beautiful, it looks as great in person as in the picture. If you buy it you will need to clean it often - it begins to dim with wear very quickly. and it is thin so if you buy it be ready for easy dents. Otherwise you will really enjoy the ring and will probably be happy with it. <end>  beautiful  I am in love with this ring. I wear it just about every day. The ring is beautiful and i definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice (but inexpensive) Claddagh band.  ) <end>  beautiful ring  The ring was as pictured on the website. It came in an orderly fashion and I enjoy wearing it. <end>  Best Claddagh Ring Ever!!  This ring is amazing!! It's a very durable ring, well-crafted, and beautiful. I love the twist on its usual appearance with the celtic knots on the side, and it's a nice, dark silver as it appears in the photos. I just wish it came in more sizes!! <end>  beautiful Celtic ring  I am buying this ring for my daughter for Christmas. I read the positive reviews and the negative reviews. I think that this ring is abolutely beautiful and very well-crafted. I am tickled about it and can't wait for my daughter to open it on Christmas!Thank you! <end>  Perfect!  The ring is exactly what I wanted. I looked locally, but just couldn't find the perfect ring. This one is all that! Perfect shine, perfect fit, perfect design. <end>  Pretty Ring  I purchased this ring for my teenage daughter. She loved the style and the delicate features of the ring. I was also pleased to find size 4, which never seems to be available in the stores. <end>  womens claddagh band polish finish sterling silver ring  this ring is very dainty compared to the picture shown. I gave it to my sister as a gift and she loves it. It is certainly worth the price. very lovely. <end>  Pretty ring  This ring is a great buy for the money. It's a little dainty in size but still a lovely, shiny ring. <end>  Love it!  This is a beautiful alternative to the traditional claddagh ring. I love the Celtic knots instead of the hands holding the heart. It makes me more elegant. The ring had a slight deformation on part of the heart but it's not too noticeable. I wear it on an almost daily basis.  D <end>  LOVE IT!!  fast delivery, lovely packaging, accurate sizing... I haven't taken the ring off since it arrived!! <end>  Awesome Ring  We bought two for Christmas - our daughters. They are going to love them as the rings are so pretty. Quality for the price! <end>  Perfect  I bought this because I needed a promise ring for my boyfriend and I, it's everything we wanted and more, it's beautiful, perfectly made, no flaws, the shipping and price was great in comparison to other sellers. Buy this! <end>  Cute, but cheap  I love this ring and I wear it everyday. However, it did turn my finger green. After coating the inside of the ring with clear fingernail polish, I haven't had any problems with it. <end>  Baby Ring  I ordered this ring as a christening gift for my godchild and was very pleased with my purchase! It arrived on time (chose 2-day shipping) and in perfect condition. The detail work on the ring is just beautiful, no sloppy edges and everything well defined. This ring is on the smaller side, I would agree with some of the other posters. I purchased it as a baby/child's gift for this reason and was not disappointed. Great seller and great product! Would definitely purchase from them again! <end>  Cute Ring!  I'm not sure why some of the reviews called this ring "large". It is not. In fact, my daughter was replacing a claddagh ring and was a little dissappointed that it wasn't a little bigger, as described in some of the reviews. It's the size I'd have expected, and she likes it very much. <end>  wonderful ring  This ring is so nice. Always trying to find a claddagh ring i like, its perfect for me. I was worried it would look too tiny by some reviews left, but its really a nice size. Nice proportions between crown, heart & trinity symbols. For the price of this, im glad i bought. <end>  Perfect!  This is a superb ring! It is very solid and does not have the cheap look of something that you can buy at clares. <end>  Lovely Ring  This is a very lovely ring. I got it to wear on my index finger and it fits very well.It looks true to it's posted picture. <end>  Sterling Silver Irish Claddagh Friendship and Love Ring  LOVED the ring!!! wasn't a fan of this symbol with the hands, but I liked it with the Celtic Trinity Knot on the sides, fits, great! Didn't discolor my finger at all, and the thickness is perfect, hasn't lost it's shape, yet!!  ) Will gladly do business with again. <end>  unique and nice  I wanted a new claddaugh ring and this is perfect. It has the traditional Irish rings instead of the hands and the detail is great. The size fit perfectly and I would buy another one for my two daughters when they are old enough. <end>  Top notch!  I have been wanting a Claddagh ring for quite some time now, and when I saw this one I immediately fell in love with it! In real life it looks much better than the picture! It's dainty and very feminine, yet modern at the same time. The quality is astounding for how cheap it is! I give this ring two thumbs up! <end>  Very pretty ring  The ring is very solid and really pretty. I did find that it ran a size smaller than average. My usual size 5 was too small, but when I ordered it in a 6 it fits beautifully. I get many compliments on it. <end>  Love this ring...  Being allergic to nickel makes it difficult to find jewelry that I like and can wear. I love the ring. It looks exactly like the picture and description. The shipping and customer service were great! <end>  Claddagh Ring  This is a replacement for one that was purchased in Ireland. Yours is a beautiful ring for quite an amazing price. <end>  Love this ring  This ring is really pretty. It is shiny and made of good metal. I would recommend this as a good bargain. <end>  Beautiful quality, great price!  I was excited to finally find a claddagh ring in my size (13!!!), and for the price, I figured if it turned my finger green, I wouldn't be too upset. Well, I got the ring a few weeks ago, and have worn it since then, with no green finger! The ring fits, looks beautiful, and is a great quality product! Thank you!!! <end>  Pretty Nice  I ordered this for my younger sister for Christmas and I have to say it's not bad for the price. It's good quality and has a nice shine. The only down side is the thinness at the bottom of the band but for the money what do you expect? All in all it's a good product and I'd recommend it  ) <end>  Lovely.  This is a LOVELY ring. It was sent promptly, and in a beautiful box with a black velvet interior. Got here before it was even set to be shipped. Quick shippers, and high quality product. Very great buy. <end>  excellent quality  I bought this ring for myself for my birthday on the 4th. I received it on the 6th.The ring is beautiful just as the picture shows, I have worn it since the day I received it and still hasn't turned my finger green. I have my hands in water all the time. (germ control freak, i guess you would say.) Still to this day have had no problems with the ring. The only difference between the picture and the actual ring itself, is that there is little to none, of the black showing. <end>  Absolutely love it!  Its perfect! It fits like a glove! I am really glad it comes in big sizes. Excellent christmas gift! 5 stars! <end>  Really pretty, unique Claddagh ring!  I've owned several Claddagh rings over the years and lost my last one. I received this one as a gift recently and I truly love it. It's sturdy and the design is crisp. I can easily recommend this one as a lovely ring. <end>  Beautiful ring  Ring is even more gorgeous than I thought. I am a stylist, so my hands are constantly in water all day, and this ring hasn't tarnished yet. Just as beautiful as the day in received it. Perfect as a gift for your loved one or yourself! I never take this ring off, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! <end>  Very pretty, but band bends like crazy!  I got this ring, and it was gorgeous, fit me exactly, but within a week of wear, the band started to change, and the silver was so thin, it bent, and my ring broke... I'd find something a bit stronger if I were you. <end>  Karen of NY  This ring is gorgeous! It is solid and beautifully crafted. Should you be a half size go up one size. The ring came in an adorable gift box with bow. This ring is truly special and I love it. <end>  I LOVE this ring!  I just happened to look at my old review for this ring, and I feel like giving an update. The review date still says November 2007, it is currently February 2010, and I have been wearing it EVERY DAY since then. I have never ever had a problem with it. I find it really strange that another reviewer said the band got thin. Odd. My ring is so sturdy. I toss it on my nightstand, wash my hands with it, etc. I love this ring so much that I would even wear it as a cheap, casual alternative to a wedding ring. Seriously. (I'm not a girl who needs expensive diamond rings.)I'm keeping this useful tidbit from my original review As a nice little bonus, it came in a cute heart-shaped box -- perfect for if you're a guy, and you want to give this to a girl. So, kudos on the presentation. And it was shipped pretty quickly. I got it about a week and a half after I ordered it. <end>  Silver Plated  Shortly after this ring was purchased my girlfriend could not wear it because it is only silver plated.Please be aware of this fact. The coating will wear off, and in some cases will cause an allergic reaction.Purchase jewelry with care when buying online, and contact the company before you purchase their product. <end>  Excellent Gift  I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loved it. The design is the standard design, but when seen in person, the ring is much smaller than it actually appears to be in the photos, and so it looks even better crafted. <end>  Great ring  I love this ring. One reviewer said that the band is really flimsy and bends easily, but I find it to be quite durable (much better than my old claddagh!). It's a beautiful, simple ring, and it comes in a cute box, which is a plus if you're planning on using it as a gift. I'd highly recommend it- great ring at a great price. <end>  Very delicate and intricate claddagh ring . i love it!  I ordered this after it sat on my wishlist for a couple of months .. I have another claddagh ring but I really wanted a bigger ring size so that I could wear it on my index finger. I was pleasantly surprised because this one went up to a size 13 I think; granted I didn't need one that big - but it was nice to know that if I did I could buy one. So yea, I finally took the plunge, symbolically speaking and bought this ring. I just got it yesterday and haven't taken it off since. I will say that it does look bigger in the picture than in reality .. but it is beautiful. The size of the heart, crown, and celtic knots are beautiful and intricate and give it a very detailed eccentric design. I really do love it and what it reminds me of - my Irish heritage. <end>  Great Ring - Even Better Price!  When I saw this online I thought it would be this "cheap" lightweight ring. When it arrived and my GF opened it...... WOW! It wasn't a "cheap" anything. She loved it which made me happy. I picked it up and again, it's not a little lightweight thing. You would have to work at it to bend it. Very well made and the price is insane! You can't find something this well made for the price. <end>  Buffy  This ring is awesome. I have been looking for it for a long time! I am a big fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and this is the same ring Angel gave to Buffy! <end>  wonderful work-I LOVE IT!!!!!  Even though I managed to order the wrong size for me, the return and new purchase was handled so swiftly and smoothly that I will not only use them again, but tell all my friends about them. Keep up the great work. It is hard to find this kind of service so I say "Thank You"!!!LWRS145-7 .925 Nickel Free Sterling Silver Irish Claddagh Friendship and Love Band Ring Size 7 <end>  Irish Claddagh Ring  Ordered and received without problems as a gift for my daughter. She saw it at Kohls and they didn't have her size. She loved it! <end>  Great shipping, poor quality product  I was very excited to receive my two nickel free sterling silver claddagh rings in only one day (I have a Prime account and get two day shipping). I immediately put my ring on (yesterday). This morning I woke up and had a green ring around my finger. If the ring was truly nickel free sterling silver, which is what I paid for, it would not leave a green ring. I am very disappointed. <end>  Beyond Satisfied  Very pretty ring- and a perfect fit for my finger. I bought this to replace my old one which broke during a boxing session.I was very impressed with the speedy shipment- it arrived the day before its estimated delivery. I was beyond satisfied with the care that was put into packaging my order.I will be sure to recommend this company and their products to my friends. As a matter of fact I will be ordering a claddagh ring for my boyfriend from this company for our 4 month anniversary. <end>  I Love This Ring!  I bought this claddagh ring a little after my best friend in the whole world proposed to me. He's of Irish descent and wears a claddagh ring himself. I bought this as a promise ring because he can't afford to buy me the diamond claddagh ring just yet. It's so cute! I wear it every day. I know there have been complaints about the band being weak and bendy, but I've had no problem. The middle of the band has a small line running down the center - and that scared me at first - but I guess it's just a scratch, since it's still holding together and seems like it'll continue to for some time. I'm very satisfied with it  cute, sturdy, and low price... you get what you pay for, and I'm getting more than my money's worth  ) <end>  Lovely  I really loved the ring when I got it in. My ONLY complaint is that it is a tad bit smaller than I was thinking it would be. But it's still so pretty and I wear it everyday! <end>  Lovely ring &lt;3  I got this as an anniversary present from my boyfriend, and it's absolutely beautiful. &lt;3 It fits perfectly, and it's a little smaller than I expected it to be, but it looks really good on my hand and I absolutely love it. It's been through the washing machine a few times, and while it's not as shiny as it used to be, it still looks great. <end>  Beautiful Jewelry  Very Pleased with purchase and would recommend Gem Avenue to others. Jewelry is better than expected. Arrived quickly and in great condition. Thanks and I will order from them again...Mags <end>  Pretty, but definitely not strong.  I bought this ring for myself last year around Christmas time and bought a similar one for my sister as a gift. We both wore ours frequently (just about every day). At first, the band bent a little but I didn't mind. It fit my finger perfectly still and since I was wearing it on my thumb, I figured it would bend into a more oval shape.The other day, I was wearing the ring and I was washing my hands and I felt a little pain in my finger, almost like a pinching feeling. Of course I look down and the band is cracked in half and no longer wearable.I don't know what caused this ring to break since I always take it off when doing something that might damage my jewelry. I'd recommend this ring but only for casual/occasional wear. <end>  Claddagh Ring  I have been looking for a claddagh ring that has a different look to it. I found it in this ring. I have received many compliments on it because it is different. The weight & size of the claddagh is just perfect. <end>  great ring  I am really happy with this ring, and I've only had it for about a week so far. The style is so pretty and not overdone at all. For those of you worried about the ring sizing chart online, just take out a ruler that has millimeter marks on it and rest a ring that already fits you on it to see the measurement. Then compare to the chart (that shows millimeter measurements). That should put you more at ease, as it did for me, since it was my first time buying a ring online. <end>  Amazing  I ordered the .925 sterling silver claddagh band polish finish ring. The ring is absolutely beautiful. It looks just like the picture and is exactly the right size I needed. I received the ring a day earlier than expected and if I needed help I know Gem Avenue would have responded back immediately. I rate this place as a 5. <end>  I Love this ring  I bought this ring to replace on an ex boyfriend got me. It was a good price and i think its really pretty. <end>  GREAT  The shipping was very fast. My daughter ordered the wrong size, so I had to exchange for a larger size. It came very quickly also. She loves it! <end>  Simple but beautiful  What I like most about this ring is that it is not too big and flashy. It is simple, yet elegant. It fits perfectly and I have already received many compliments about it. I would highly recommend this ring! <end>  A very good, underappreciated gift  Came in perfect condition, good delivery time, even a cute little heart shaped box. Wish I could have tried it on before buying it, ended up being too small, but good return policy as well. Also would have been nice to get more thanks for it, but that's not Amazon's fault. <end>  Amazing!  The ring is absolutely gorgeous! Because of its smaller size, the exquisite details stand out more. The shipping was fast, and the gift wrapping was cute and classy. I love this ring, and will always cherish it  ) <end>  Always Wanted One!  I love it. The box it came in was cute. The Claddagh ring is something I always wanted. I love this ring. It's very feminine. <end>  Excellent Claddagh Ring  I bought two of these rings to serve as my wedding bands. I am Irish and found it wonderful that it wasn't so "girlie" that my husband approved to wear it. This item is an excellent size to wear with an engagement ring and I was happy with the quality of it. Highly recommend! <end>  Perfect!  I recieved my ring in perfect time, it was just as pictured, and the size was perfect, too!Now that I've covered all the basics...This ring is absolutely beautiful! I haven't taken it off since I got it and it still looks lovely! <end>  Perfect!!  It is beautiful, the shipping was fast and the service and qualty are excellent! Beautiful box as well. <end>  crappy  Silver plated, not silver! This ring turned my finger green after the first week! Don't buy this ring, do a little more research and buy a better quality product! <end>  Let down  I was extremely excited to receive your product. After waiting a few weeks to go the beautiful ring, i was LET DOWN. It was such a shame, within 5 minutes of putting on the ring my finger was green and the silver had already rubbed off. I tried to polish the ring only to find out it was not sterling silver. What a waste of my money i cannot believe i spent 20$ on a beautiful ring with misleading advertisement. DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS SELLER!!!!! <end>  terrible quality, only silver plated  I bought this ring for my girlfriend and the next day there was a green ring on her finger. The description lies because this ring is only silver plated. You can now see the silver dissappearing and the inside of the band is turning green. DO NOT BUY THIS RING!!!!!!!!!!!! <end>  Not real - caused serious allergies  I was so excited to get this ring because I LOVED the design and I've always wanted a claddagh ring but when I wore it, I was extremely disappointed. I only had it on for about 3 hours before it made a 2 inch wide green ring around my finger and even though I took it off, I still got a major rash later on. The ring is NOT real, which should have been mentioned in the description. My finger is now scarred up because of how serious the rash got. Don't buy this ring if you have any reaction to cheap/fake metal. <end>  Looks nothing like the picture.  They didn't send me the same ring as in the picture, similar, but much cheaper looking. They also don't run true to size at all. I'm a 6 and this must be a 7 1/2. Don't waste you money. <end>  Great Ring!!!  This ring is a beautiful piece, I bought it for my sister and I think she will love it. The box that it comes in is adorable!! It is perfect without wrapping it yourself! <end>  NOT REAL STERLING! - NO STAMP! GREEN FINGER! A FAKE!  I just recieved this ring from my boyfriend as a birthday gift. After one day of wearing, I'm having an allergic reaction - as the ring is NOT sterling silver. Upon closer inspection there is no 925 stamp on the ring as the as suggests. This is a fake. Do not purchase it if you have sensitive skin and can only wear sterling, gold, or platinum. HUGE disappointment. <end>  Looks Great  Hands on a ring weird me out, so this was great.I have some concerns about the .925 sterling silver,so we'll see if my daughter's finger turns green at any point.But for now, it was a great purchase and gift. <end>  Super cute  It is smaller than pictured- but i love it! Showing off my Irish pride  ) <end>  Horrible service  Gem Avenue shipped me the incorrect ring and will not return the correct ring without a fee. Consequently, I am stuck paying $5 extra, compensating their blunder. <end>  PURCHASED THIS ITEM  I PURCHASED THIS ITEM GREAT QUALITY FOR THE PRICE U PAY GOOD SIZE NOT TO THIN LOOKS GORGEOUS ARRIVED ON TIME <end>  Love it. I just wish it had been a little larger in size  This is a beautiful piece. The ring is gorgeous. Well made and very unique.I would definitely recommend it to any one looking for a pretty piece. <end>  Not A Mens Ring  It looked as though it was a mens ring and I purchased it for my husband. When I got the ring, I realized it was a ladies ring. Not at all what I expected. Disappointing. Please specify ladies or mens. <end>  What a nice Claddagh Ring  This claddagh ring has the celtic symbol instead of the hands folded hands, I prefer the hands. II gave my friend that was allergic 2 nickel this 1. She LIKED IT. <end>  Kudos to Gem Avenue!  OMG!! Just got my beautiful ring today. I got it much quicker than expected. I have wanted one of these rings forever and I must say I was sceptical about what the quality was going to be like for the price. I am just overwhelmed at how lovely this ring is and I am very HAPPY that I bought it! I really like that it's a little different than the usual claddagh rings that you normally see. I LOVE DIFFERENT THAN EVERYONE ELSE!! <end>  Thank you  Beautiful ring, I wear it all the time and it just stays shiny and looks wonderful. Thank you again very much <end>  This is good quality ring and a very pretty ring  I bought this ring for my wife. It came when it said it would come and it is a very good looking ring. <end>  A Beautiful Ring  This is a beautifully crafted and well made ring. It was just what I expected it to be and more. <end>  Dainty ring - great for teenagers or women with smaller fingers.  Great ring for the price - my teenage stepdaughter loves it. I gave it a 4 because it was a bit more dainty than I thought it would be, and wouldn't want it for myself. <end>  Love my Ring  I love this ring. Fits perfectly and is very cute. I am Irish and like the look of this ring. Wore it for two weeks straight and no green fingers... <end>  LOVE IT!  absolutely love the ring i wear it everyday. my friend who frequents ireland says its sooo beautiful. i love it <end>  Silver Irish Ring  The ring was beautiful and very reasonably priced. Super fast shipping. Excellent vendor. Highly recommend and I would definitely buy from them again. This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, and she loved it! <end>  Just got mine yesterday!  I love this ring, and it shipped as promised a day before it was estimated. Will buy from again soon! <end>  Perfect for everyday wear!  I bought this ring for myself. The price was right and I loved the design....both an Irish and Scottish silver ring. I have small hands and this was perfect! I wear it almost everyday. I have had many compliments on it and enjoy wearing it with anything from jeans to church clothes! <end>  Beautiful Ring!  This ring arrived in a wonderful ring box. The ring is beautiful, looks just like the picture if not better. Fits great too it's just the right fit. <end>  beautiful rings  These are spectacular rings. Real shiny with a Celtic design on them. I bought two of them as Christmas gifts for my husband and myself to open together on Christmas I also bought the claddagh ring mini book as a keepsake. We already have wedding bands so I plan on him wearing my claddagh ring on his little finger and I will wear his on my index... <end>  Love this ring  So comfortable, cute, understated, and classy. It fits perfectly and is not cheap looking. We bought it to use as a wedding band and I think it does the job. I like the celtic trinity knots around the crowned heart instead of the hands in some of the other rings I have seen. <end>  Fine ring!  This is a very nice ring. Nice workmanship and not thin (as remarked by one reviewer). I know my grandaughter will love it. <end>  Cute!  I have been buying this ring a few times this year. I bought all of my best friends the same ring for their birthdays,to symbolize our friendship, and they loved it. Although I just purchased the last bunch, including mine, I ordered two of these rings back in March for two of my friends, and the rings re still in perfect condition, even though my friends wear it all the time. The ring is smaller than expected, but like others have mentioned,it makes the ring look even more delicate and elegant. It really is a great ring, and I'm glad that the design is so well crafted that all of my friends that have received it, love it. <end>  Absolutely exquisite!  I bought this ring on behalf of my brother who was giving it to his girlfriend. It looked lovely on the site of course, but when I saw it first hand, I was amazed at the artistry. I've seen a LOT of Claddagh rings in my time, and this is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful rings I have ever seen. It came in a beautiful gift box, and in my opinion, you can't beat the price. My brother gave it to his girlfriend, and according to him, she loved it as well. I'm thinking about buying one for myself! <end>  Lovely ring  My husband ordered this ring for me. It is beautifully detailed, and I love it! My only bit of advice if you order one is that you order a bit larger than you think you need, as the ring runs small. <end>  Lovely ring  I used this as an interim wedding ring while my real one was being made. It's exactly as pictured, very detailed and substantial. I wear it on my right hand now as it is so lovely and it's held up well. <end>  Claddagh Ring  Arrived on time. Very nice and shiny. I purchase for my index finger. It looks very elegant. I recommend it. <end>  Amazing!!!  It is absolutely gorgeous and fits perfectly!! I got in two days when it wasn't supposed to come for a week!! <end>  Amazing  Really really good quality. I wear it everyday and it has the same shape and coloring as the first time i wore it. As a person who never really wears rings, i was a bit skeptical about buying one online, but its perfect and i get many compliments on it. I absolutely love it! i would recommend it to all of my friends. It is my favorite piece of jewelry, and the new spin on a classic makes it more unique and adorable. <end>  So very cute!!!!  I bought this in the smallest size available for my 6 year old for her birthday and it was perfect. It is very heavy weight and has beautiful detail. It is exactly as pictured! Would buy again if I needed a gift for any child or lady as far as that goes! Arrived very promptly in a ok little box. I give it a A+. <end>  Exceeded expectations!  I ordered this ring for my teenage daughter for Christmas and was happily surprised when I saw it! It has substance to it but yet it is feminine enough for a young lady's hand. My daughter absolutely fell in love with it and she never takes it off! For the price, I would say that this is one of the best bargains I found this Christmas!! Completely satisfied with the quality of the ring and it arrived very promptly even though it was quite close to Christmas! <end>  Terrific buy!  I bought this ring for my 15 yr. old daughter. My husband and I both wear claddaghs and she wanted one to match. I saw this and thought it was neat looking with the Celtic work where the hands traditionally are. I gave this to my daughter for Christmas and she adores it. She has worn it every day since getting it. Though it looks fragile, it's sturdy enough to survive her after school sports without bending and has not tarnished. I would definitely recommend this item for anyone who wants to give a gift of love without breaking the bank! <end>  Very Beautiful...  I bought this ring for my Daughter. She LOVES it & wears it all the time. The ring itself is very durable and well crafted. The shipping was speedier than I expected which makes it even better. This ring was an all around "great buy" and will definately order from Gem Avenue again. <end>  Love it!  I loved this for the price but when it arrived it is gorgeous! My daughter will love it. Its prettier in person. <end>  irish ring  This ring is very nice, It has a different design but very nice. It came in a pretty little heart shaped box, with a bow on top. Perfect for gift giving. <end>  Great!  I was very pleased when I got this ring. It looked exactly like the picture which sometimes isn't the case! <end>  Amazing!  I have been looking for the right claddagh ring for over a year, and the previous ones I have gotten in the past had gems in them that fell out, so this is the perfect ring that I have been looking for and I am very satisfied with it. <end>  Silver Claddaghn  Received June 26th. Bought for my wife who just loves it. Its a beautiful ring and its a perfect fit. Well worth the price paid and the service was outstanding. Highly recommended!!! <end>  Crazy Fast  The ring looks great and I plan on wearing it often. If you like big rings it probably isn't for you. I was amazed how fast it arrived, one day before the estimated day of arrival. <end>  Love it!  I have wanted one of these rings for a long time. I love the design and the price was better then anything i found at a local retailer. The shipping time was excellent and i didnt have to wait any more then 5 days before i got my purchase. Thanks for it all! <end>  great bargin  I purchased this ring for a gift for my daughter's birthday. The ring was nicer that the picture looked online. She was really pleased with the ring. <end>  good stuff  She loves it, she wears it everyday, and she's gotten tons of compliments. A beautiful piece of jewelry at an awesome price. Service was awesome and it came in a little heart shaped box. Absolutely perfect and a great gift idea. <end>  Claddagh ring  The ring was much more beautiful than a picture on the website could give. I enjoy it very much!!! <end>  great deal  this looks great. you would never know how inexpensive it is. great buy. just wish that they had half sizes. definitely recommend <end>  Irish ring  I think its a great ring it did have a little blemish,i never write it cause it didn't fit but once I informed the company of these problems their customer service was great...I just dropped it off with ups to return it only because I ordered the wrong size and found a ring that looked more like my style but I might end up buying it again after I receive my full refund on my dads credit card and but it myself when I receive my paycheck.;).I liked it as a ring finger ring and I had one similar when I was baptized as a baby but that ring is no longer around ( so you'll also be hearing from me soon after the sixteenth.i just want to thank amazon and the company for being so understandings and kind to me as a costumer ill definitely be buying more from them, thanks again michael <end>  Awesome  I was a little cautious after reading what people said about it turning your finger green and the band being too flimsy. But I liked the design so much that I got it anyway. And for me personally I don't believe the band flimsy at all and as of yet key finger has not turned green, and I've been wearing it for a while now. But that said, everyone's skin will react differently than other people's. I'd say if you really like this ring, buy it and give it a try. You have a 50-50 chance that it will turn your finger green, but like I said, everyone's skin reacts differently. It's unpredictable what reaction you will have.I LOVE my ring. I would defefinitely recommend this to others. <end>  Nice ring  Ring is almost exactly as pictured. The heart is not as full and rounded but that is a minor difference. I have not turned green so metal is silver. Overall a nice purchase. <end>  love this  I was excited about getting this ring and absolutely love it. i get compliments on it all the time and i am not having any issues with my finger turning colors or any rashes because of the metal used. i would recommend this ring to anyone that has to watch what metals. <end>  love this ring.  I love this ring. It is exactly what I was looking for. Simple design but details are clear. I would buy this ring for others too. <end>  Beautiful.. But...  This ring is very nice. The details are amazing, looks just like the pic. But it feels a half size smaller than I ordered and I am kind of a stickler about jewelry comfort and that's why I gave only four stars. <end>  Amazing quality for a great price...  I bought this ring for myself back in February. Since that day, I have only taken my ring off when I shower. I wear it swimming, exercising, etc. At first I was concerned it would turn my finger green, but after 7 months - Nothing! The ring itself has no odd coloring like most cheaper rings tend to get.Great product! <end>  Very Pretty ring, But Easily bent & Silver came off.  I bought this ring in 2011, It was very Pretty. Then After wearing this ring It has bent to an odd shape and the entire band is missing it's silver. No longer wearable it turns my finger black. <end>   )  I think three years ago, i bought a ring like this from kohl. I ended up tripping one day and the ring broke in half and i was devastated. When i saw this ring on amazon which was almost the exact same, i had to have it  ). It has lasted me perfected since January, and hasn't even got a scratch on it, the shine dropped a little but i still love it! great product. <end>  Perfect  This is just what I needed to put a smile on my GF's face. She loves it and is wearing everyday..... <end>  Delicate little claddagh  I was surprised how small and delicate the ring was, but it has really grown on me. The celtic knots are gorgeous in person, way better than the hands on a more traditional claddagh! I think I like it better than the one I lost... <end>  Claddaugh Ring Rocks!!  Being of Irish descent,the Claddaugh has always held a special place in my heart.When I found this particular ring on your site, I was taken by the unique design,and promptly placed my order.The ring arrived in a most timely manner,in a very nice gift box,and was even more lovely in person!! I've gotten many complements on the ring.Thanks for such great service and reasonably priced merchandise...will definitely be ordering from you in the future! <end>  Wonderful ring  I love the Claddagh and really love this unique design using the celtic knot substituing for the hands. I ordered an 8 and it fits perfectly. Great value for the price, you will not regret purchasing this ring. I will order more items from this seller. <end>  Very beautiful ring  Very beautiful ring. The claddagh is a little smaller than expected but it turned out to be the perfect size. The ring sizes are very accurate. Great quality for the price!!!!!! Very fast shipping, and awsome customer service!!!!!!!!! <end>  Love it!  I ordered this ring as a reminder of someone very important to me. I wear it everyday and I love it! It's beautifully crafted and withstands even the most harsh of treatment ( I'm a photography major in college and have my hands in chemicals all day). I highly recommend this ring if you want a more modern twist on an old Irish tradition. <end>  Best Deal, Top Quality  I bought this ring for my husband's birthday. He is going to Ireland, and has always liked this design. He likes silver, but only with a good polish, and not too heavy.This ring was perfect. It has a great polished finish, the weight was perfect, and the design was exactly what you see online, no flaws. This is a must buy and I shopped this ring online for a while and found this to be the best buy/quality. <end>  Happy Customer  I love this ring. It doesn't have the hands but it is beautiful, everywhere I go, people comment on how much they like it cause it's a little different. I wear it everyday and it still looks beautiful. I'm a nurse so it gets it's wear and tear, i put alcohol gel on it 100 times a day and it still hasn't tarnished. <end>  Irish Promise Ring  This ring is perfect! 100% sterling silver. Perfect fit! Perfect look! Love it! <end>  fits perfect  quality very good and am very satisfied with the product..very happy and wear it daily..many compliments are ade daily to me <end>  Beautiful ring...  It is a beautiful ring and it fits great. I was a bit concerned when I opened the box. Somehow the anti tarnish sheet was left out of the box so it needed to be cleaned but it didn't take much before it was shining like it should be! <end>  Beautiful for the $  I ordered this ring for my best friend because she wanted a claddagh ring for Christmas...I think its unique,beautiful...yet simple...I think she is going to love it.Great buy  -) Im happy with it...what she thinks is the real test tho! <end>  Great gift  My mother was very happy with this ring. She was delighted that it was a little different than the other Claddagh rings she had seen with the Irish knots on the sides. Very good price! <end>  lovely ring  I ordered this ring to replace a Claddagh ring that I had lost. I really love it and wear it every day. In fact, I will probably buy one for my sister as well. <end>  High quality ring at an excellent price.  This is a gorgeous ring that manages to be feminine yet sturdy at the same time. I've worn it daily for the past month and it still looks fantastic and has kept it's shape. The sizing is perfect and the band is extremely comfortable. This is most definitely the best Claddagh ring I've ever owned. <end>  Beautiful  This is by far the the prettiest Claddagh Ring in Sterling Silver I have had. I love the design, and I love the way they used the Celtic design rather than the two hands. I am well aware of the significance of the two hands that hold the heart, but for me, I just like this one better. A beautiful ring top quality ring for the price. I will return to shop there. <end>  very nice ring  i ordered this ring for myself, and have been wearing it every day. it's very well crafted and just as pictured. i'm very happy with it. <end>  wonderful  I bought this for a pinkie ring and it looks and feels great. I get many compliments on it. It is dainty and feminine. I have worn it continuously for several weeks and NO problem with green finger at all. I believe it is a quality item both in workmanship and in sterling silver content. <end>  photo doesn't do it justice  Lovely item - photo doesn't do it justice. GREAT value just wish it had been a little smaller. 3.5 would have been great as a pinkie ring.will enjoy this ring for a long time.Thanks <end>  cool ring  Hello I got this as a replacement for my other claddagh ring that I lost in the ocean. and it's much better and shinier. I am very happy with my purchase...I will cherish this one and hopefully never lose it!  ) <end>  Wonderful little ring.  Like I mentioned in the feedback, this seller was in my same state and shipping was great (on time, condition, etc.) It was exactly what I was expecting and looking for. <end>  Awesome!!!!  I have always wanted a claddaugh ring.This price was great.I love it <end>  wonerful service  The service was excellent. I received my ring within a few days. Have had many compliments on it. <end>  BEAUTIFUL LADIES' CLADDAGH RING  ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, DAINTY LADIES' RING, PACKAGED IN A VERY SWEET PINK SATIN HEART-SHAPED BOX. WONDERFUL BUY FOR THE PRICE. <end>  Beautiful  This is a beautiful ring and is in very good condition. It was also a very well priced item. <end>  GREAT VALUE!!  Gorgeous ring at a great value! The only negative was that they now have limited sizes so I couldn't get one for my friend!! I wear mine 24/7, I LOVE IT!! <end>  Very Pleased  I bought the ring for a birthday gift. It was a hit at the party. It fit very nicely and looks really great! <end>  Awesome Ring  This was a christmas gift for a friends girlfriend. She was absolutely thrilled with this ring. She wears it non-stop. <end>  great  I ordered this claddah ring and I am very pleased with it!Ship was very fast and I received it very quickly. It looks great and I wear it everyday. Thank you! <end>  Cheap and plastic looking  It's cheap!! It looks like plastic, I actually had to check inside the band to make sure it was sterling silver. I guess you get the quality that you pay for... <end>  ring, great! shipping, not so much...  I love this ring and I think it's beautiful, but it took a while to get here. Over all, I'm happy with the product and the ring sizing charts provided on the site are very accurate. Enjoy!  ) <end>  Good quality and value  I originally bought a different ring but returned it when I saw this one. I wear it everyday and it is very well made. Does not bend or scratch. It is very comfortable and I have had lots of compliments on the ring. The vendor is really interested in making the customer happy. I will defintely buy more from them. <end>  Disappointed  Was stoked when I got it and then by the second day it turned my finger green because it's not real very disappointed! <end>  Great Style, Turns finger a little green  The style and design are great. It did however turn part of my finger green. Its a really mild green and is on the bottom of my finger, probably from my sweat. Id recommend this ring to people, unless its a gift. It might be embarrasing if you give as a gift and the recieptant's finger gets slight green markings. <end>  My Favorite Ring!  I ordered this ring back in February 2008 and have worn it everyday since! It's such a unique Claddagh ring that I get complimented on it quite often. I know a few other people mentioned that band was so thin that it broke and that the coating wore off but I haven't experienced either of these issues. The only time I take it off is when I go to sleep at night, so I wear it all the time (even in the shower) and it's still in great condition - even 4 years later! I even bought a back up, just in case I ever lose this one  ) <end>  Worth Every Penny  )  Looovvveee this ring. If you are having any doubts on buying it... GET RID OF EM! It is true to size, stunning in person, has a cool story behind it, and is overall neat! It's great for any season and fun to show to friends! A+ from meee  ) <end>  Awesome Quality!!!  This ring was arrest purchase! Great quality! Doesn't make your finger green like cheap jewelry. Would recommend this to anyone! <end>  Beautiful Ring....  This claddagh ring is so pretty! I have worn it for several months every day and it hasn't bended, changed color, and it only has two unnoticeable scratches. The size was even perfect for me! I would recommend this ring to anyone who likes the picture! <end>  Beautiful  This ring is beautiful, I just love it. I ordered it because it was unique from the other claddagh rings I have seen before. Usually you see hands on each side of the heart but this hadthe knots oneach side instead. My only wish is that it wasn't so dainty but a little bigger. All in all, beautiful!!! I would still order it again. <end>  ok for price  did not take long to ship to house,get what you pay for, still will turn finger color, would not buy again. <end>  Claddagh ring  i am so excited to have this ring. i have been looking for a cladddagh ring. I love the design. it is beautiful!!! <end>  Pretty - but not worth the money  Pretty ring, but turned finger green after 1 day...I would not think sterling silver should turn your finger green..! <end>  Cute  its very pretty but the only complaint i have is the heart is a little crooked. All in all it looks like the picture. <end>  wow  My second engagement Ring got it on my birthday i love this nice and shinny lol must buy ring for anyone <end>  Great ring!!!  I just got this ring 2 days ago but I already love it! It is very hard to find rings in my size, 13, that are cute and really liked this one and took a chance on the size and it is perfect!!! I love it and would recommend it to anyone! <end>  Charming  I love this ring. Is very detailed. Looks exactly as pictured. I was a little worried about sterling silber, but I haven't had a problem and I never take it off! Was exactly what i wanted! <end>  Turns my finger green  There is no way this ring is sterling silver. After wearing it for 8 hours it turned my finger green. I don't have any problems with any of my other .925 sterling silver jewelry. I'm so disappointed. The ring is beautiful. I feel saying it's .925 sterling silver is misleading. <end>  Absolutely gorgeous  I was a bit nervous ordering this piece with the deal I got on it. It arrived and is beautiful as is expected. <end>  i liked it....she loved it.....everyone is happy...  i am satisfied..... i have not more to say and if i have to say more i will just skip the eval all together.. <end>  LWRS043-11Nickel Free Sterling Silver Irish Ring  I love my LWRS043-11Nickel Free Sterling Silver Irish Caddagh Friendship ring. I look better than I thought that it would and true to size. I am thinking about buying another one . Delivery time was speedy. <end>  Gorgeous ring!  This ring was purchased for my daughter, and I especially wanted one that was sturdy as well as pretty. This one is perfect for her, because the band is thick, the design doesn't have any obvious &#34;weak spots&#34;, and the silver is nickel free so she won't have to polish it to keep it looking as gorgeous as it is today. She loved it... and will wear it every day. I realize the celtic knot design next to the heart/crown isn't the traditional &#34;hands&#34;, but in my opinion it makes for a sturdier design and my daughter and I are delighted. 5 stars. <end>
 B000Q9SG1K  Sterling Silver Diamond cut Polished Finish Marcasite 2mm Band Butterfly Ring Size 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ||	  Great little ring  Great ring for a super price. Great craftsmanship. I wear it all the timeI. I have small fingers so it's really hard to find little rings & even then they re sized wrong. This ring is true to its size <end>
 B000QC57YG  Sterling Silver 9mm Head and 4mm Tail Engraved Floral Design Stylish Snake Polished Finish 3mm Band ||	  Nicely Detailed  I like this ring. It has a pretty, lacy look. The dark areas aren't as obvious on the ring as they are in the picture. There's not that much contrast, but the detail work is still very nice. Quite sturdy. Doesn't bend like some silver does. <end>  Love it!  Used to have one when I wad In highschool as a thumb ring and lost it. I've been wanting another one ever since. Fits perfectly on my middle finger but a little small for my thumb. Still looks good tho <end>
 B000QCIO8W  Vintage Style Sterling Silver Filigree .50ct Cubic Zirconia Ring ||	  Beautiful ring  This ring is so pretty, looks like a real diamond and the setting if just lovely, I am very happy with it. <end>  Looks really cheap.  Bought this ring for daughters birthday.Big disappointment.Other reviews sounded great,ring looked great in the picture.The ring arrived late which turned out to be a good thing as I would'nt have given this as a gift after seeing it.Looks really cheap,very poor quality. <end>  Beautiful ring  This ring is very pretty. The filigree band is detailed and elegant, and the cubic zirconia is set nicely. It looks like my great-grandmother's wedding ring, and it's much more practical for daily wear. <end>
 B000QCIX6K  Vintage Pearl Chandelier Earrings ||	  Beautiful!  I wore these earrings for my wedding day (July 2010) and they looked great! It's been about 18 months and they have not shown signs of corrosion or color change like cheap jewelry does. I've gotten plenty of compliments on these earrings! <end>
 B000QCIYL4  Jeweled Cross Hematite Tone Light Sapphire Color Long Necklace ||	  Beautiful piece of jewelry!  I bought this necklace for my teenage daughter and she LOVES IT! I own an extensive amount of fashion jewelry myself and think that this is a gorgeous piece. <end>
 B000QCJ4LI  Sterling Silver Butterfly Ring, Size 5 ||	  SO PRETTY, but not sturdy  This ring is so pretty, I got so many comments on it. But it's not very sturdy or strongly made. I slipped my hand into a file cabinet and the ring caught on a file folder and snapped right in half! I was so upset because it's so pretty and I loved wearing it. So my advise would be - wear when you're not working! <end>  not good quality  I purchased this ring only to return it. It's a beautiful ring, but the quality is not very good. It says it is adjustable, but when I tried to tighten it, it sounded like it was cracking. I thought it would break in half. It felt like a plastic ring, rather than sterling silver. <end>  I loved this ring.  I actually didn't buy this ring on Amazon but somewhere else. I love this ring; it's cute, but not childish. You can also resize it if you want because it's bendable. When I wear it, everyone who sees it compliments on it. <end>  sterling butterfly ring  I bought this for my daughter-hope she likes it. I found it to be beautifully unique. <end>
 B000QCK7L4  Devoted to MOM  Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish and Cubic Zirconia Eternal Circle MOM Pendant Necklace ||	  A bit uggly  I do not like the color, it's very small and do not shine at all. <end>
 B000QCKQIS  Sterling Silver .925 Briolette cut Aquamarine cubic zirconia small disco ball dangle cz Earrings ||	  Bad choice  Bought these earrings along with another pair from another vendor. They arrived about 5 days later than the other pair. NOW - the "aquamarine" ball on the hoop has fallen off. Nowhere to be found, which brings up another point. You can hardly see the "small disc ball" - so, when they say small, they mean small. About half the size of an eraser on a pencil. Now - the ball has gone AWOL. don't waste your time with these.As an update - I have yet to be contacted by the seller to even offer a refund on these earrings.So, "Buyer Beware" <end>  blue disco ball earrings  These earrings are small and cute, great if you like hook earrings with small dangle. Blue color is good, I would purchase again. <end>
 B000QCN6XU  Vintage Collection Rose Motif Pearl Tone Beaded Necklace ||	  Rose necklace  This was a gift for my Mother-in-law with the matching earrings. It was just as pretty in person as it was in the picture. Very nice purchase. I would highly recommend. <end>
 B000QCOHUG  Eternal Circle of Life  Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish and Cubic Zirconia Eternity Circle Pendant ||	  beautiful  This is a really beautiful piece. I have it as a gift and my cousin loves it. It sparkles and shines and looks like a much more expensive piece. A great buy! <end>
 B000QCOHXI  Ladder of Love  Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish and Cubic Zirconia Journey Pendant Necklace ||	  lovely necklace  I been thinking about buying this necklace for a while, because i was waiting for the price to drop down from 19.99. However, it never change in price and i thought 20 dollars wasn't too much for a necklace of good quality. The necklace fit everyone's great reviews on here. The "diamonds" and the necklace were both very shiny and look very attractive under the sun. The only bad thing i would have to say about the pendant is the right "stick." The right side was done a bit poorly, as i immediately notice it was not straight but slightly wavy. If it wasn't wavy on one side, then i would had given the product 5 stars (as i could of gotten a pendant of a similar quality for a much cheaper price at a department store). Overall, I am happy in the product and fast shipping (three days earlier than expected!). I would purchase from Peora again. <end>  great value  bought this for my wife, I was down on money but wanted to get something nice and this is great. Wife wears it everywhere, and everyone compliments her on it and askes if its real diamond. So I am very happy with it. I did not get the chain with the purchase, I thought It came with one so check that out first. Good Luck <end>  Beautiful Necklace  Love this necklace - and so does everyone else!!! I have fooled a lot of people who think it is the real deal. <end>  Peora Has Quality CZ Diamonds  I was a little hesitant to order this pendant. I've been ordering CZ diamonds from another company that says their CZ's are the best in the world. Well, that's just---absolutely not true. Peora CZ diamonds are excellent quality, beautifully cut, with a whole bunch of fire and depth...very clear and brilliant. I would have paid a lot more than 14.99 at that other company, and would not have found this exact pendant.It's an unusual take on a journey pendant. One of the many things I like about Peora, is their designs are different and unique. I've seen a lot of jewelry, but they have designs, I haven't seen anywhere else. The setting is solid silver and substantial. It looks and "feels" so good. The bail is hidden. The pendant is nice size...not tiny. It's tension and semi bezel set, so it is very secure. What can I say? Peora has great quality. The pendant has a rhodium finish. For anyone who may not know, rhodium is a metal in the platinum family. It is lovely. You'll be very pleased with this one. I know I am.I just wanted to add; Journey pendants have meaning. In most journey pendants, the stones are set to weave "in and out". What attracted me to the design in this pendant, is the stones start very small and each stone graduates in size, "on a straight path". At the point in my life, that what I want; to stay on track while continuing to grow. <end>
 B000QCPMKU  Sterling Silver Flower Ring, Size 5 ||	  Love it!  This is a beautiful ring. Very comfortable to wear and striking. It's substantial and not at all flimsy. <end>

 B000QE0546  Splash of Hollywood Glamour Just For You  Sterling Silver Rhodium Finish Celebrity Inspired Celtic Design Vintage Brooch ||	  Celtic Flare was a hit.  I bought this to give a little "celtic" flare to a dress i wore to a friend's wedding (they had an irish theme). Though I had hoped the pin was a bit bigger, it served it's purpose and I got a lot of compliments on it. "thumbs up" <end>  Great quality as always  I have ordered this pin on several occasions via Amazon, and they are always in perfect condition, as described, and beautiful. I don't feel they need to be so expensive, but this is the only one of its kind that I've seen. <end>  very pretty  I wore this on my wedding day as a small accent. It is quite small and slightly overpriced but it was beautiful and the perfect touch. <end>

It came in a cute little box with a bow on it and the delivery was quick. I would definitely buy from this seller again. <end>  Great ring for a child!  I bought this ring for my seven year old daughter. I find it so hard to find quality rings in children sizes and this one was perfect. She loves it! And it came in the cutest heart shaped box. I couldn't decide whether I like the ring or the box more! A great price as well. That way if she does loose it, it's not the end of the world. I am thinking of buying one for me and for my 4 year old as well! <end>  SUPER CUTE =]  THIS IS A SIMPLE BUT ADORABLE RING!!

The hearts are well detailed and look very delicate, while still being a sturdy ring. It's really shiny, for being so open in the middle, and is very light and feels good to wear. I'm sure I'll wear it all the time  -) <end>  great ring for the price  This ring is sturdy and definitely a good buy. My daughter loved it because it is simple and sweet. I wanted to get her an inexpensive ring to see how well she keeps up with it. It wears very well and the sterling is of good quality. Hope this helps. <end>  THIS IS A MUST HAVE  I LOVE this ring SO much! Its simple and cute- They ship fast and it comes in such a cute little box. I can't wait to order again. Fits VERY true to size. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I bought this ring for my 16 year old daughter, it looks really good on her finger. It came in a cute pink box and fit perfectly. <end>  Soo cute...even more so than the picture!  I ordered these rings for my bridesmaids and they are soo cute! No one has worn them yet, but I was astounded at the quality. They are even more shiny than the picture and are very sturdy. They do not feel like the easily bendable metal rings you buy in stores. I ordered 5s,6s, and 7s and they all seem to run very true to size. My wedding ring is a 6 and it fits the exact same as the 6 I ordered. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a fun, cute gift for girls of ANY age.  ) <end>  Beautiful Ring  I absolutely love this ring. I received it sooner than I expected..it came in the cutest heart shaped box! Loved it.  b When i first wore it and got it wet after washing my hands, my finger started turning green..i dont know if this was just in my case. I was very disappointed,,but after a couple of days, I finally decided to wear it again and what do you know,,it was just a one time thing. I wear it everyday. Its awesome and my finger is the color its supposed to be. Totally recommend this product. Will definately buy from seller again.  )UPDATE I wear this ring everyday and its still in good condition! La la loooove it! Thank u to the seller for such a beautiful ring!  D <end>  I wear it all the time!  I wear this ring almost every day. It's not too bland, and yet it doesn't scream for attention. I usually wear it on my thumb just cause it doesn't really fit any of my other fingers, and it looks pretty nice. After searching for a while for an everyday ring, I am very glad I found this one.  ) <end>  Smiling Wife  My wife loves this ring, altho she has more expensive rings, she says its the thought that counts and that makes me feel good too so if you want to make her happy, amd feel good yourself try this little honey, you wont regret it. <end>  Dainty Ring  This ring seems very delicate. It is smaller and thinner than I was expecting. It is still a cute ring if you are looking for a quiet and subdued look. I think the sizing may be a little off because I ordered a size larger to fit on my middle or index finger, but I couldn't even force it on and it fit on my ring finger perfectly. I think this would be a cute ring for a young teenager. <end>  Twin Hearts Review  This ring is very beautiful. The quality seems to hold up nicely. However, it doesnt tolerate water well and will begin to tarnish quickly. But for the price it is a very nice ring. <end>  Great as a gift!  Got this as a gift for my little cousin and she absolutely loves it. No problems with size or anything! Item came as described and it was a late gift just before christimas and they got it to me on time. Will purchase from this seller again <end>  My daughter bought this ring, She loves it!  My daughter is 11 she used her money to buy this ring, and she loves it! She order the wrong size, we sent it back, and payed return shipping in check form, and they sent her a newone! Great customer service, thanks! <end>  This ring is perfect in every way. It looks so pretty! Cleans up so nice also. Highly recommend it  This ring is perfect in every way. It looks so pretty! Cleans up so nice also. Highly recommend it <end>  Very Nice  This ring was very nice. Even better looking than the picture. It was good quality, good fit, and what a deal! <end>  Great ring for twins!  I have twin daughters and purchased this heart ring for each one of them. They are absolutely beautiful and just delicate enough for thier dainty hands. Thank you so much for a beautiful and affordable product! <end>  so beautiful  tthe ring was the best gift i could have ever ask for my husband bought me the twin heart ring i used to have one a cheap one it messed up and ive wanted one for years and he found this one is so much better than my old one it so strong and beautiful i love it thank yall sooooooo much will buy from yall again....................... <end>  great little ring  I bought this ring on Ebay for approximately the same price. I bought it to wear as to work so I don't destroy my diamond engagement ring, but I still have a ring to wear. (I've destroyed many rings by wearing them to work) This heart ring is cute and fits perfect. I love it, so much that when I wear my diamond I wear this one on my other hand just so I don't have to take it off <end>  Emotional Twin Heart Ring  I bought the Emotional Twin Heart .925 Sterling Silver Love Ring from Gem Avenue. I was very pleased with their courtious, fast and honest service. The price was also very reasonable. I would and probably will do business with them again in the future. I am very please and recommend them for anyone to use. The ring was absolutely beautiful. I brought two different rings one for each of my neices, both heart rings because they like hearts. I know that they will love them. The rings came in these little cute boxes with a cute little bow on top of each one. Thanks so much for the wonderful service. <end>  Pretty Little Silver Ring  It is very pretty and delicate. It would look better on a woman with small smooth hands. It kind of gets lost on my old hands and I will be wearing with another ring. I am very pleased with its quality. <end>  Beautiful  I bought this same ring at Kohl's. My daughter loved it as it fit her tiny finger. Unfortunately she lost it and her heart was broken. And of course the store had no more. I was so excited to find it at Amazon the price was very close to the store's. But the best it was in her size and it can in time for Christmas. Thank you thank you Amazon. I will be order from you again real soon. <end>  Nice  Ring is a lot thinner than i imagined but good for the price. i would like it if it were a little thicker. Cute. <end>  Lovely and Charming  This is a beautiful ring! I bought it for a friend of mine, and I love it so much, I'm going to get one for me! Arrived quickly and packaged in a cute gift box! <end>  beautiful  beautiful ring. i wear it everyday. i got one for my mom and not it both represents out friendship and love for each other. (though my mom does say i'm defenately the upsidedown heart!)  )like this product?NEVERlove it!!!!!!!!!!!! <end>
 B000QEGHL6  Sterling Silver 12mm Wide Crafted Crocodile Polished Finish 3mm Wide Band Ring Size 6 ||	  Super cute ring  This ring is way cuter than the pictures show. I really only bought it because it was cheap and I wanted an alligator ring. It definitely exceeded my expectations. It is light-weight, and perfect for someone who likes unique, but not gaudy jewelery. And although it was cheap, it doesn't look like a cheap ring (i.e. you got it out of a quarter machine).I am definitely satisfied with this ring. <end>  Awesome ring  Love this ring not too big doesnt take up my whole hand, spins around my finger sometimes little feet get caught on some things but i love it!!!!! <end>  !  I ordered this ring and got more than I wanted. It's not bulky and it's incredibly light weight. The only problem I have is it slippy down my finger from time to time. But I would recommend this for purchase. <end>  So cute!  I love this ring it fits perfectly and is so cute. A great conversation piece. <end>  My Gator Ring  I ordered this ring because I had an older one that just wasn't what I wanted. So I got this one it fits the middle finger perfectly and is just the right size. It is comfortable and lightweight to wear. Sometimes it may catch on my other ring but no probably . It is easy to unhook from the ring it attaches itself too. Everyone just adores my little gator. Go Gators. <end>
 B000QFL17A  Attorney Cufflinks by Cuff-Daddy ||	  Love it  Wawwwww...these cuff links are beautiful. Got them for my bf and he loved them. Wish they had them in silver as well.  ) <end>
 B000QG1WQO  Sterling Silver Diamond Cut New Marcasite Ivy Leaf Polished Finish Band Ring Size 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  not a good choice for small hands  This ring looks delicate in the photo but much less so when you receive it. It's best for someone with fairly large hands. I'm 5'4" and wear a size 6 ring and it looks very clunky on me. Also, it's definitely not one of those rare finds where you can't believe how little you paid for it. It looks like a $20 ring, which is fine since it's nice to have rings like that for casual wear. And on someone with large hands it would be quite nice. <end>  Best Price  I saw this ring on another site for a lot more money and am glad I bought it here instead. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it -- it really draws the eye. Fast delivery, beautiful ring. <end>  Gorgeous statement piece!!  This ring is beautiful and stands alone wonderfully as a right hand or a left hand ring. Excellent value, fast shipping, unique piece! <end>  Sterling Silver Diamond Cut Marcasite Band Ivy Ring  The marcasite ring was beautiful. It was delivered promptly. It was received in a beautifly wraped box. I would definately order items again. <end>  Elegant ring.  The photo does not do justice to this georgeous, graceful ring. I wear this often - it is truly lovely. <end>  Excellent Value !  Very well made. Much, much more than I had expected because of the low price. I will definitely be shopping here again and again and again. <end>  Unique leaf ring  I love this ring. It's pretty, slightly shiny, and very graceful. The size is large, but it's a delicate design, so it appears just right (I have smaller fingers and wear this on my middle finger). It's also thin on the finger, which makes it comfortable to wear, even with the unique shape. The value is amazing, so don't hesitate to buy. <end>  Vintage style  .925 Sterling Silver Diamond cut Marcasite Band Ivy Leaf RingI absolutely adore this ring. It's simply lovely. Very comfortable and pretty to look at, yet sturdy. I've received many compliments, and would most definitely recommend it. <end>  Beautiful ring!  This ring is really beautiful piece of jewellery. Everybody who noticed it, gave me a compliment. Delivery was quick and the ring has been received in a nice gift box. I would definitely order items from Gem Avenue again. Would recommend this seller! <end>  silver ring with marcasite  I really like the leave design and how the ring wraps around my finger. It is comfortable and very different. <end>  Stunning!  This is definitely my new favorite ring. I've worn it every day since I received it and have gotten so many compliments on it.The shipping was speedy, the product was gorgeous and prefect and I definitely appreciate the little ring box it came in.Will definitely be buying from them again (and probably soon!) <end>  Beautiful!  I received this ring for a Christmas present from my sister, and it looks great. I think it looks better in person than in the photo. I have very small hands, so I wear it on my middle finger. I think that proportionally, that is probably the best finger to put it on. I think it's a little overwhelming as a ring-finger ring. I really love the marcasite, and the ring is very shiny. I was surprised to see the price when I looked it up on Amazon to write the review. I thought it would have been more expensive. I also like that it is real sterling silver, so it doesn't upset my sensitive skin.The one thing I don't like is the design sometimes catches on things like when I stick my hand in my pocket. I am a little worried that I might catch it and bend it since silver is a malleable metal. I just try to be a little more careful when I am wearing it out and about. <end>  Beautiful Ring  I love this ring. It goes with my style very well and is a great addition to a variety of looks. I will be wearing it often! <end>  WOW***  You Were So Right!!! The Picture "Does "Not"do this ring justice! It is absoloutely breathtaking!When I opened the box....I actualy said "WOW!". Just did not expect such a "BEAUTIFUL SURPRISE"!I'm ordering a second one .....just in case anything ever happened to it!!! <end>  Very nice  My girlfriend really loved this ring. It is a very great ring for the price. <end>  Perfect fit!  This ring is a perfect fit -- it's very unique and great quality...well worth the price!! <end>
 B000QG58E6  Sterling Silver New Top Quality 20mm Length Ocean crab Polished Finish 4mm Band Ring Size 8 ||	  Loving It  This ring is perfect for me! It's very sterdy and I get alot of compliments on it. I wear it all the time. Great fit. <end>  review  This ring has sharp parts that will cut you so be careful.

 B000QG71IM  Sterling Silver Polished Finish Filigree Floral 12mm Wide Band Ring Size 6 ||	  Love this ring!  I absolutely love this ring! It looks great, goes with everything and is so attractive! I get compliments on it all the time. It's different and fun! <end>
 B000QI1LG8  Indigo Kittens Gold Earrings by Laurel Burch ||	  Lovely Seller!  I couldn't wear these earrings. Not because of them, I have allergies. They were adorable and this seller is a real professional. <end>  Can I have them?  This has been a frequent question from my friends. It is something so special that I have been offered twice as much as their price was. <end>
 B000QTZNZM  CZ Treble Clef Necklace ||	  CZ Treble Clef Necklace  The necklaces were exactly what I would expect. They were of fine sterling silver and came in a beautiful gift box. I was very pleased with this order.Ann D. <end>  Love It  I've always wanted a musical note necklace and I couldn't get what I wanted till I went on amazon. I saw it and i recevied it in three days and I love it. I would suggest if you want a nice gift for a girl who loves music to get this necklace it is beautiful and elegent. <end>
 B000QV237Q  Pirates of the Carribean Tia Dalma Necklace ||	  Tia Dalma Necklace  This product met my expectations. It looks nice, but does not have as much weight to it as I would like. <end>  Tia Dalma Necklace  Nice replica of the necklace Tia Dalma wore in the Pirates of the Carabbean Movie. Great for someone who loves to collect memoribilia from movies! <end>  Godess love  I really wanted to buy a necklace from pirates of the caribbean - I love the movie. I wasn't a huge Tia Dalma fan, but I liked the look of the necklace. So I got it. It doesn't hang as far as the one in the movie, but its an EXACT remake other than that. Real metal, not plastic or such. All-in-all its great, I love it. I recomend it to anyone who loves Pirates or love or Tia Dalma ---- and if you can get past the tentacles, Davy Jones. <end>  very nice  I think this is a nice piece of jewelry from pirates. It's nothing big obviously so don't be disappointed if it's not what you thought it was, but if you're a collector of pirate stuff, I recommend it, especially if you have kids, but be careful not to give it to real young ones, cause if the necklace were to break or something, they could choke on the beads, but it's nice! <end>  Tia Dalma Necklace Review  This purchase was for a Halloween costume and as such the item has not been used fully yet, though I expect it to be durable and everything as required. It was not purchased as a toy, so the standardized review stars are of limited use. <end>  Interesting...  It's pretty neat.It looks really nice on the outside,almost exactly like in the movie.My only problem with it is that it's only one-sided.It's not a locket or anything.It's just the face of the necklace.If you turn it over, there's nothing there... <end>  I didn't consider this necklace as a "toy"  it was a great accent to my costume. the chain was not long enough for what I was wearing. it stopped just above my cleavage and it was hollow in the back. it was very light and a fantastic replica. a good buy if you are dressing up a tia dalma. <end>  Nice replica  I bought this for my sister because she has the golden coin necklace from the first movie and she loves it. From the picture, it looks like a hunk of plastic junk. It is actually pretty heavy and it's pretty. It doesn't open, but it looks exactly like Tia Dalma/Davy Jone's locket. Pretty good necklace, perfect for POTC lovers! <end>  Great &#34;jewel&#34;  It's a nice piece, unfortunately, is not an actual cameo, so it does not open and you can not put a photo. However, I do not want it to be functional, but to keep it in my personal treasure. Thank you. <end>  Not what I expected, but is still great  Granted, I was a little disappointed at first that the back is hollow, but over time I got used to it. I wear it every day. It is a little heavy, but not too much. Although, I wish it opened up like the real thing, it's still pretty cool to wear <end>  Cheap but cool  The article is a cheap replica but I can't complain about the price. You're getting what you're paying for =P <end>  Costume Gear  I personally used it for my halloween costume and I thought it was a nice addition to my overall pirate look. Some negatives  the back is hallow and has no design so every time your emblem flips over (and it will because the chain looks nice but is terrible at keeping the emblem on the right side) it will show a blank boring back. Slightly annoying, but if you're at a halloween party, no one will probably notice anyway. If you're like me and rather spend money on accessories rather than buying an actual costume, then this might be the accessory for you. I wore this with other necklaces, a pirate wig w/ bandanna, some rings, white shirt, waist belt, boots, shorts, and spiderweb tights. Came together perfectly with stuff I mostly already had for under $20. <end>  Wouldn't wear it, but it's nice to look at.  I bought this on a whim back in 2010 and it still looks just as it did the day I took it out of the packaging. Granted I only use it for decoration, but still, it's a sturdy item. The actual necklace is great and feels heavy (wish there was a back though so it was an actual locket) but the 'chain' part feels more like cheap mardi gras beads. I wouldn't wear it without putting it on a better chain, but at this price, there's really no reason to complain. <end>  It's Ok  I bought this item to use as a prop. You may want to replace the chain for something more dureable, depending on what you are using it for. The amulet is not a solid piece. It is hollow in the back and easy to bend, so be careful. Overall, for a prop, it is worth what I paid for it. <end>  Good for the money spent  This was worth the money I spent, which was about $3. I would not pay any more than that, it's simply not worth it. The "chain" (really just some plastic beads) is a LOT shorter than I was hoping, but it's easily removable so I will attach a longer chain. It looks authentic enough, and any real Pirates fan will know what it is. <end>
 B000QV6SF4  Adorlee Asian Jewelry Box ||	  Beautiful jewlery box  It is a beautiful jewlery box, but I used it on a bridal shower party toput the gift envelops, I got many complements.It is worth the price. I recommend it. <end>
 B000QY1ABS  Sterling Silver 10mm Wide Minimal Triquetra Polished Finish Filigree Celtic Knot 3mm Band Ring Size 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ||	  perfect  for the price this ring is very good. i love the way it looks and it feels on my finger. the pakaging was nice as was the little box that was in it.it is .925 silver by the little stamp on the inside.iv worn it in the bathtub and shower many times since i got it and no problems. with things other than gold and silver for me my finger turns green and gets an infection this has not done that so it is deffintly silver.the celtic sign looks really good compared to other rings with celtic simbles i have seen. this has gone on the list of one of my most prized possesions. <end>  Everything great  Everything about the transaction and product was great. Make sure you know your ring size first. Here are some more words to make this review long enough. <end>  beautiful ring  This is a beautiful ring.There's not much to say beyond that. It is well made and looks exactly like the picture. <end>  Love  I was so excited to get my rings in. I wanted a ring that didn't have a stone but had Celtic meaning. I wear this one daily too! <end>  I second, Pretty and Delicate!  Size, was perfect...exactly as pictured, packaging was absolutely adorable, it arrived in a pink heart shaped box, which as a girly girl, absolutely appealed to me. 925 sterling, and for the price, totally worth it. you get what you paid for. I disagree with those who complain about warping, its sterling silver and the price was below 20 dollars...what more could you ask for? seriously! <end>  Love it  I received my order in good time, and I love it! It came in a cute little box and is beautiful. Fits perfectly, the sizing is accurate. I accidentally bent the band a bit because I punched our table (I don't have anger management issues, I was just messing around XD), but I was able to fix it, and it doesn't seem to have weakened the metal at all, so it is made of good tough stuff. I wear it every day, even to work, and it is both durable and lovely. <end>  Disappointment  When I first saw this ring online I was like "omg it's a must have." After reading the reviews from other people I thought this would be a very good deal. It arrived on time and looked like the picture but the size was too big and it was bent a little bit. Now after wearing it only a few days its whorped even more. Overall, this purchase was not the best, but I still wear it anyways even with the flaws. <end>  Beauty!  I love this ring! It is not at all bulky, and much prettier than the picture. I am also a 'Charmed' fan and now I have ring to prove it. Many compliments from friends, family and co-workers. <end>  Beautiful Celtic Knot ring  I am very pleased with my new ring. I was not sure about ordering a ring online...not anymore. Looks exactly like the picture, fits perfect and true to size. I am looking forward to ordering again. <end>  Fabulous Celtic knotring.  I have a locction of sterling silver Celtic rings. This one bypasses all in quality, design and size. <end>  Beautiful ring  The ring was exactly what I expected it to be. It fit perfectly and arrived promptly. I couldn't ask for more. <end>  A nice simple ring  The sterling silver ring has a nice shine to it, and it is a fine gift when you're looking for something nice and simple. The service is great and Gem Avenue took care of the order quickly, so you should be able to rely on having a gift in good time. <end>  wow  VERY GOOD RING, GREAT SHIPPING SPEED, AND IS EXACTLY THAT WAS EXPECTED A PERFICT PRODUCT <end>  My Review  I am extremely satisfied. The picture of the item couldn't have been any more detail. Very good communication with the sellers and I will most definitly consider doing business with them in the future!! <end>  excellent  Like the ring. Fits really well. Got it in a timely manner. Amazon had the delivery date as Nov 13 and I got it on Nov 9. <end>  IT WAS REALLY GOOD  I'm rally happy with the ring. I'm glad to say that i had a very good experience with you and ofcourse that i would by again from you thank you very much!!! <end>  not quite like picture  I really like the customer service, and the box it comes in is absolutely adorable...however, the ring is not at all what I expected. A little smaller than I expected, and the top...well, the little circle thing with the knot inside? Well, it juts out so far, that it reminds me of one of those Egyptian signet rings. I almost dipped it in wax to see if it would leave an imprint on an envelope! The design is great, except for the fact that the top juts out and I haven't gotten any compliments on it, except for my Mom's. Ah, I would not really recommend this ring, unless you wouldn't mind it looking like a signet ring. It is real silver, though, and very glossy and shiny, so I would give it a three star rating. Just my personal opinion. <end>  Triquetra Ring  I bought this for my daughter and she loved it!!! Very nicely made for the price. She was very happy! <end>  Ring  The ring fits my finger beautifully! It is gorgeous! I love it! Gorgeous Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous <end>  You get what you pay for  The ring looks like the picture but is very low quality. Of course, for the price I didn't expect anything high end or quality. It bends and dings easily, but for a cheap ring it's nothing more than I would expect. <end>  Celtic Trinity  This ring is exactly what I wanted, I actually bought another and it wasn't quite as solidly made as this ring is. Thanks for the great ring! <end>  Completely love it.  One of the best things I've bought. It IS delicate and I learned that the hard way unfortunately. A friend of mine smacked my hand for whatever reason and it bent so I'll be ordering another one soon.. (along with two additional ones for my two best friends). It came in a nice little box with a bow on it. I've had it for over a year and wear it almost every day. (I'm not one for jewelry but I loved this ring). Great buy and I WILL be ordering from this company again. You see in the picture exactly what you get in the mail and for the price, you can't go wrong. <end>  Totally awesome ring!  I ordered this ring because I was really impressed with the detail shown in the picture. But when I got it, I was even more impressed. It is absolutely beautiful. High shine and beautiful craftmanship. And the price was amazing! I would definitely recommend this ring to anyone who loves celtic jewelry. <end>  pretty and delicate looking ring...  purchased this ring for ring finger.... suits it very well; delicate looking, comfortable and pretty... love all my rings from Gem Avenue .... great purchases in pretty packages  -) <end>  Very Pleased  I was pleasantly surprised at the look of this ring. The photo doesn't quite do it justice. I thought since it was an inexpensive ring that it would be thin, but it isn't. It looks even better in person! The order was delivered in a timely manner and I am completely satisfied. I would do business again with Gem Avenue.Cheers to GA.  ) <end>  Beautiful!  This ring is absolutely beautiful! I love Celtic images, and silver jewelry, so this caught my eye immediately. I was afraid that at this price it would be thin or flimsy, but it is solid and well made. It fits well and looks terrific. A fabulous deal! <end>  Love it!  I bought this because not only do I love silver jewelry, I have a tattoo just like it on my right inner wrist. For the price - this was a most fabulous deal!!! I could not find nice silver jewelry like this anywhere for that price. I love my ring and it fits well. I will be ordering more. Service was excellent. <end>  Beautiful ring  I ordered this for one of my daughters and it is even more beautiful than the photo. We received the ring very quickly and it came in an adorable little gift box. <end>  Great Value!  This ring is beautiful! It is a Celtic knot in a contemporary design. Well done and true to size. I liked it so much that I ordered rings for my two nieces. I have purchased from Gem Avenue in the past, and they continue to provide excellent jewelry in a cute gift package and speedy delivery. <end>  Celtic Knot Ring  I am very happy with my purchase, I wasn't sure how well it would fit but it fits great. I'm very pleased that it came so fast and in such great condition. <end>  Perfect ring for smaller fingers  I recently purchased the Filigree Celtic Knot Band Sterling Silver Ring. I have not purchased a lot of rings on line but some that I have, turned out to be to wide for my smaller fingers. This is a perfect size and the design is beautiful. I am very pleased with this ring. <end>  Love this ring!  Bought this ring to wear on my pinkie. It is well made, shiny, and perfect. I am extremely happy with it. <end>  Excellent Celtic Knot Band  I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design. I do quite a bit of typing during the day so a thicker/wider band works better for me and this ring has that along with a beautiful design. I wear it everyday and couldn't be more please with my purchase. This is an excellent deal for your money! <end>  Filigree Celtic Knot Sterling Silver Ring  Quality of the ring is very good. The craftsmanship of the design is superb. Unfortunately cannot wear ring for extended amount of time due to an allergic reaction with skin (not fault of seller). I would definitely shop with this seller again. <end>  In love with this ring!  I usually wear a claddagh on my right hand .... but it cracked from years of wear and tear. I could not seem to find any that I liked, so I began to explore options such as celtic knots - and more specifically the trinity knot. I did not have a lot to spend, and I'm very particular - it can't be too big, and obviously I wouldn't want something so small it's a waste of money.The ring came fast, well packed, and I was excited. Because there were no half-sizes, I had to order half size up (I wasnt' willing to have it too tight) and I love it!!!! I wouldn't call it overly dainty - but it's a nice contemporary - but classic look and the finish is nice. It complements my very simple wedding band and solitaire without going overboard.I TOTALLY recommend this ring to anyone that has sentiment in the Trinity knot, or the holy Trinity. <end>  Intriged by Trinity  Since many years I have been attracted by the celtic designs in jewellery. I am a Churchmusician, and when I could combine the celtic Trinity with a piece of jewellery my preference for symbolism was complete. This was twenty years ago; so I was very happy to find these two (ring and cross pendant)pieces in your online shop to extend my collection. <end>  Great ring, great price!  Great ring! I bought it for myself and its just wonderful. Sturdy ring, beautiful design. I would highly recommend this ring to anyone who likes celtic jewlery. <end>
 B000R4C9JE  10k Gold Journey Birthstone Pendant Necklace, 18" ||	  It's ok, but we returned it  It was a little big. It was a little wide too so it would end put laying on it's side when she wore it. The blue was is a nice color though. I got her another one that was smaller with real diamonds. It cost me $300 bucks so it cost more, but she like it a lot more. Probably because it's diamonds. I am looking for another nice one with her birth stone on it now. <end>  Wife Loved It!  Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife and she loved it. It was exactly as described and delivery was very timely. Would definitely buy from this vendor again. <end>  Surprise Birthday Gift! Very pretty!  I have never had a lab created sapphire and was surprised how dark the stones were. They do not have a star quality to them ~ however is a great necklace to wear with so much. I have gotten a lot of compliments on it. The light chains are traditionally sent with these types of necklaces and you can swap it out for one you like better. But the lighter ones do create almost a floating look when they are this lightweight. And a lady never says no to jewelry ;) !!! THANK YOU for the LOVELY necklace. <end>  I scored so many points with this!  I bought this for my mother-in-law's birthday. I knew she loved the journey concept, the price was good, so I figured, why not?She was floored!Its a very generously sized pendant, the stones are clear and sparkling, the gold is subtle, and the color combination is very appealing.If you're on the fence, do it. Its a good buy! <end>  Great gift  This was purchased as a gift for my daugher. The August birthstone and symbolic message of the "journey" was meaningful to us. Arrived on time, in good condition, and she loved it. Thanks <end>  White Topaz Journey  If you love the look of diamonds but do NOT want to pay the price, this is for you! I have had so many compliments and I never let anyone know it was white topaz. Just wonderful for the price! <end>  March "journey style" drop in aquamarine  I love my drop, but am disapointed in the chain... not because of faulty advertising, but simply because it is so delicate and fine that it is very easily tangled. The drop itself is lovely, and I am thrilled with it! <end>  Well worth the price..  This was gorgeous. The wife loved it. It was for our anniversary and we were on a budget. This fit the budget and yet looked more expensive. Great buy.. <end>  10k White Gold White Topaz Journey Pendant  Very nice pendant, nice quality, when I first saw it you could not tell the the difference if it were a diamond or white topaz, I would purchase it again very nice product. <end>  10k white gold june birthstone pink sapphire pendant with 18" necklace  Pendant is beautiful, but the necklace itself tangles easily and does not really match the pendant. It would be worth spending a little more for a better chain. My daughter picked it out for me for chirstmas and I wear it every day <end>  Excellent Valentine's Day present  I bought this for my wife for Valentine's Day/Birthday. Her birthday is in February and amethyst is her birthstone. She loves it and has gotten many compliments on it since she has been wearing it. It is so unique in comparison to the diamond journey necklaces. <end>  nice but not really nice enough  looks really good online and people gave it really good reviews which is why I bought it for my mother in law for an upcoming birthday. However the chain is really thin and there is a loop on the pendant that doesn't lay flat when you wear it. I am keeping it because I am running out of time but this should be under $100 and not as much as it is. <end>  journey pendant  this pendant did not disappoint. Stones are clear, setting is excellent. It was well packaged and it arrived exactly on time. <end>  daughter loved it  Gave as a gift to my daughter, March baby. Raising her young family, gone back to school, and working. Definitely on her journey through life. And doing remarkably well.Good quality stones. Looks really nice on her. <end>  10 K GOLD PINK SAPPHIRE JOURNEY PENDANT  I BOUGHT THIS NECKLACE TO WEAR FOR 'BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH'. I LIKE TO WEAR PINK AND THIS NECKLACE IS SO PRETTY AND SPARKLING. I HAVE HAD SO MANY COMMENTS, ASKING WHERE I GOT IT. I LOVE IT AND WILL WEAR IT OFTEN DURING THE YEAR TOO. IT IS EVEN PRETTIER THAN THE PICTURE AND AT A VERY GOOD PRICE. I RATE THIS NECKLACE AT 5 STARS! <end>  Beautiful but bad quality!  I bought this for a friend and it looks very beautiful! However after just a months wearing one stone fell out, and within a couple of hours two more stones fell out. For this price I would very much expect better quality. I certainly will not be buying Amazon produced jewelry again... <end>  Beautiful  The color was amazing! What a great deal. This would have been so much more expensive in the jewelry store. I bought a thicker rope chain but other than that, great buy! <end>  Jewelry?  Not what i expected, was a bit small...but again its always hard to judge something like this via the web...i will stick to the store. <end>  Beautiful  Great necklace. It is much larger than the picture makes it look. Beautiful purple color and overall a beautiful necklace. <end>  Pretty "Journey"  The 10k White gold March Birthstone Aquamarine Journey Pendant itself is really pretty. My daughter is quite pleased and was very surprised on Christmas. The only complaint I have is that the 18" chain clasp will not hold. It has come undone somehow twice from her neck and we were just lucky enough to have seen it both times and not lost the pendant. I recommend checking it closely if you purchase this pendant, but I would repeat this purchase with intentions of replacing the chain. <end>  birthday suprise  I recieved this beautiful pendant for my birthday. My husband suprised me with it. The sapphires are a deep dark blue, the chain is delicate so I might change that so I can wear it daily, but a great piece to own, if you love sapphires. <end>  Cute little piece  I got this for my wife's birthday. I like the size of the pendant, the flow and feel of it. But beware - you will need to upgrade the necklace (but face it, at this price you knew that already).The stones all match in color, and do make a beautiful statement. The only reason why this isn't a 5-star is because the purple was not quite as deep or radiant as I would have liked it to be, they seemed a little washed out. But (as far as I can tell) she doesn't care! <end>  Nice for the price  I got this as a present for my mom and it's nice for the price so far, very clear stones with good color quality. <end>  Nice, but the chain could be better  I agree w/the other reviewer (not sure why the 2 star rating)...I generally don't like the lab-created stuff becaused the colors don't ring true (and WTF is it w/multicolored sapphires? if it ain't deep dark blue, it ain't a sapphire), but this is not too badLike a lot of other pendants, you really should get a better chain for it...granted I wore it a lot, but I accidentally did something (not sure what) and it broke <end>  Not satisfied  This pendant is not exactly as I imagined. It was a gift and the recipient was happy but am not satisfied. I've only bought jewelry once before (pearl drop earrings) and they were exactly as imagined. I would hesitate to purchase more jewelry on this site. <end>  No color  I'll be brief, looks clear, even with a piece of white paper behind it. Still attractive, but as a birthday gift intended to include birthstones it is disappointing. <end>  Gems not good quailty  I was dispappointed with how light the gemstones were. They are very pale, and some are darker than the others. I would not buy this again. <end>  Christmas Gift  I purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother. I am very disappointed in the quality of the product. <end>  Classy or casual  It doesn't matter - wear it with jeans or your dressy dress. Simple and elegant <end>  Beautiful  I bought this pendant for myself being that is my sons birthstone. I was a bit apprehensive at first about the quality of the stones, clarity and overall appearance. I was pleasantly surprised, the pendant is beautiful and of it looks expensive, not cheap. I have received many compliments. I am very happy with my purchase. <end>  Excellent Piece  I bought this necklace for my wife as a "push present" when our son was born. She was absolutely thrilled with it and receives compliments on it all the time. Some of her friends have similar necklaces that were much more expensive, and hers looks just as good. <end>  Nice for the price!  I recently purchased this necklace for my daughter's 13th birthday. It was shipped promptly and packaged well. The color of the stones is nice. I was surprised at the size of them. They were larger than expected and I was afraid they'd be too big on her. I wouldn't recommend it for a child younger than 13. Sized for an adult. She thought it was beautiful! <end>  Not Blue as Pictured, But Pretty  I just ordered this pendant for myself. Aquamarine isn't my birthstone but I love blue and wear a lot of it. This looked like a great deal, but when I got the pendant I wasn't sure if I had even received the right item. First of all, the 18" necklace that accompanies the pendant arrived tied in knots. I'm not sure if it's also 10K gold, but it is so delicate and small that I won't dare wear it for fear that it might break. It was also annoying that I had to spend half an hour untying all the knots. I am not at all impressed or even mildly happy with the chain, but the chain was not the reason I placed the order. More importantly, as far as I'm concerned, the color of the pendant itself is not at all blue like the image on the website.The pendant I received is a very, very, extremely pale blue if I manage to look at it in the right light. Most of the people I showed the pendant to also mistook it for a white gem. It doesn't seem at all to be the item pictured on this webpage. Friends who commented on the pendant didn't think it was an aquamarine and it's mistaken for diamonds, CZs or white sapphires. I re-read the small print on the product page and it does say that the color of the gems may vary from very light blue to evidently what is pictured. I guess I'm going to keep the pendant though. Occasionally you can catch a hint of blue color in my pendant. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry. Being as I was born in April and diamonds are my birthstone I guess if it's mistaken for diamonds that won't be so bad, plus what girl wouldn't mind if something were mistaken for diamonds, right? I do have to say that if I had wanted a clear or white gem, I would have ordered the white topaz version of this pendant available on the April birthstone link. (10k White Gold April Birthstone White Topaz Journey Pendant, 18") The white topaz version is, after all, a little less expensive. The gems I received do not look anything like the blue pendant pictured here, but if the blue color isn't that important to you, it is a very nice pendant, which I do believe to be genuine aquamarine, and worth the $99 sale price. As I mentioned, it is a very pretty piece of jewelry, just not what I expected to receive. I hope that the blue color does occasionally show up when I wear it, but I'm not keeping my hopes too high on that front. (I don't think I would have put up with this lack of color had I paid full price, and would likely have returned the pendant). <end>  Very Lovely  I was very pleased with this lovely pendant because of its high quality and because my wife likes it very much. She wore it yesterday and it really looked good on her. She even liked the nice jewelry box that it came in. It was one of my most successful gifts to her, especially considering the reasonable price. I highly recommend it. <end>  Flimsy  This is a very pretty necklace. However, I had to return it because one of the top stones was lying next to the pendant in the box, when it arrived. I started to have it repaired, but when I realized how extremely flimsy it was I changed my mind. <end>  Beautiful  The stones and setting are beautiful. the chain is so small i haven'tbeen able to put it on, i can't hold on to the clasp to fasten it. ineed to look for a more substantial chain. <end>  Exquisite shade of blue, romantic and tasteful  I love this necklace. The color, the size of the stones, the shape. Lays perfectly in place on my upper chest. The stones are not too big and not too tiny - just right in size.This necklace looks much better in person than it does in the photos here, but it's true as another reviewer mentioned that the pictured stone color is not completely accurate - the pictured stones look like a deeper blue, but in reality the blue is clear and true, translucent, a very very pale blue like aquamarine should be; but is it ever alluring! The way the stones curve, it looks so whimsical and graceful.I have fair slightly ruddy skin and it looks nice on me but I think it would be especially stunning on someone with olive or a darker tone skin. (I think the blue might slightly emphasize the ruddiness on my chest I have from past sun damage).This would be a great gift for a daughter or a girlfriend or wife. It is not my birthstone, I bought it because I love this sky blue color. The only down side to it, the clasp is small and not so sturdy, but that could be replaced by a sturdier one, like a toggle clasp or just a larger lobster clasp, and it would be perfect. <end>  Beautiful  The Journey Pendent is of great quality and larger than I've seen for the same price in the mall. I know its going to be a Merry Christmas because I bought this for the woman I love.However, only 4 stars because I agree the Chain is not that impressive. <end>  Beautiful Pendant  The pendant is a beautiful piece with some weight to it. If the chain was heavier, it would be great. However, I'm currently looking for a stronger chain so I can keep this. <end>  Great Necklace!!!  I bought this for my girlfriend as a present. It is her birthstone, and she had mentioned liking this stone. I was a bit apprehensive at first, but then I received the necklace and was very pleasantly surprised. She absolutely loves it, and wears it all the time. The necklace is beautiful. I am very glad I made this purchase. It was shipped promptly, and the stone are nicely set, and presented. Great product! <end>  Pink Journey  I bought this necklace as a gift for my dear friend who is celebrating surviving breast cancer for 5 years... I thought it was appropriate to mark her journey...and the pink stones were perfect. well, she LOVED it and I am totally satisfied with this purchase. Thanks! <end>  Aquamarine Pendant  Absolutely beautiful pendant, just a hint of blue in the stones, they are cut beautifully. A wonderful first mother's day present for me! <end>  Very Nice for the Price  I really like this necklace, my only concern is that the back loop where the chain passes through is rather deep so that the necklace does not rest flat against the chest. This can cause it to rotate side to side or flip backward more than I expected. Also the clasp is TINY so you need very delicate hands to put it on with out help. <end>  Lovely Birthday Gift  Aquamarine is my birthstone, so this was a perfect birthday gift. It's very, very lovely, very sparkly and the stones are the appropriately very pale blue of a true aquamarine, not the ruddy blue of blue topaz, a cheaper stone that's often falsely presented as an aquamarine. Any March baby or lover of a quality aquamarine will love this pendant. It's also a good size.The only issue is the uber-thin chain, but most chains that come with pendants these days are like that -- I put all my pendants on one of the three 'good' chains I have so it's not a problem for me. <end>  Color Off  Great value for what I paid and it looks great. However, just as other reviews advise, the color is nowhere near the picture shade of blue. <end>  Beautiful!  I bought this for my girlfriend and it looks great! its not too big or too small. It look really nice and really shines. <end>  Great but a little different than what I expected  I got this for my girlfriend for Valentine's day. She loved it and it's great. The only thing I noticed is that it doesn't look any sorts of blue like the picture, the stones appear to be clear <end>  Great Necklace  I needed this necklace for an event and when I received it, it looked great. It actually looked better than it did on line and I got tons of compliments <end>  misleading image, actual product MUCH paler  I'm not very pleased with this item. When I purchased it, I thought it would look like its image on the website. When I received the product, I was startled to discover that the gemstones were so pale that it was difficult to determine if they were even amethyst at all. I do not recommend this item be purchased by anyone, unless you want to have a reason to return items and waste your time. <end>
 B000R4Y53M  Bullock White 48" High Wall Curio / Jewelry Mirror ||	  I love this!!!  I was super excited to receive this jewelry wall mount. The box came nicely and no harm was done inside. The jewelry box is solid wood and very heavy. My husband went and bought some heavy duty screws to mount it with because the ones it came with were a little small. Plus, two of the three were not going to hit a stud. It took both of us to get it up, but we managed and I absolutely love the look. I don't have a lot of jewelry, but it has plenty of room inside for my collection to grow. <end>  Wall Curio  I really like the curio it saves a lot of space and keeps my valuables locked up. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It also has a mirror which doubles as two things that would take up sapce in your room. <end>  Best Gift in 20 Years  I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! Says it's the best gift she has received in 20 years. It is well built, attractive and was fairly easy to install. Lining up the holes was a little challenging but definitely do-able for the average handyman. I found it best to drill the top 2 holes, put wall anchors in, hang cabinet using nails to keep in place and then mark bottom hole with an awl.My wife says she wants another one of these for her birthday. <end>  White 48" High Wall Curio / Jewelry Mirror  We were more than satisfied with the jewelry armoire. I is well build and arrived well packed. We like that you can lock it for security. <end>  Could be a life saver  This cabinet can truly be a life saver. If you have a lot of costume jewelry and you have to dress for work on a daily basis this piece can make your life easier when trying to assessorize in the morning. Very pleased with the quality but a bit difficult to hang. <end>  Works Great  Finally a problem resolved. Stinks though, air it out first. Make sure you have studs where you want the product to be. <end>  Solid Cabinet, Mounting Vague  Great cabinet construction, solid hinge and door. Inside felt actually comes in black, which is better and more modern. It has enough room that my wife's dresser door and jewelry on top of the dresser fit inside.Mounting is a bit troublesome, and I'm pretty handy. The wall anchors are crappy. Twice I drilled through them. I replaced with my own. Also, the door is so heavy you need to either remove (wish it made that way) or have a strong person hold it while mounting. <end>  Why did I wait so long  Super product...had my eye on it for years and thought it would be too big with not enough to put into it. So glad I finally brought it . The only difficulty it that there is too much space for rings. Oh well, I guess I will consider that a buying opportunity. Everything is now at eye level which makes it easier to make selections...great for costume jewelry collections. Bracelets are harder to store because of their width. <end>  Made a great gift  I got this for my wife because she has a lot of costume jewelry that was scattered among numerous jewelry boxes. This thing is huge. It held all her costume jewelry and all her other stuff. She loves it! Therefore, so do I. <end>  Bullock White 48" High Wall Curio / Jewelry Mirror  my brother gave this to his girlfriend for Xmas and she loved it. it has enough space to hang up all her jewelery. <end>  Good quality. Excellent  It lost a star because it was very slightly damaged when it arrived. Nothing too significant, but if I'd been able to take it to a store, I would have done so.It is heavy and solid. It's has room to display a lot of jewelry, especially necklaces and the 4ft mirror is also perfect. <end>  Great Gift  Bought for my wife as a Christmas present. She show it to all family as it is very well made and looks great. <end>  Nice for jewelry  Works great. Received in good working order and is perfect.Thinking of ordering one for my sister for her birthday. <end>  Loose shelf  The bottom mini shelf in this product is loose. It can be nice because you can take the self out and go through your items but you can also knock it out easily. Otherwise this is a perfect jewelry box.. <end>  Good purchase  Lots of space for jewelry & easy installation. Magnet for door works great. Mirror on the front is an added bonus. After a month it still smells like the factory though. <end>  Showed up damaged and Customer service is a joke.  I gave this to the wife for Christmas and when she opened the box and removed the cabinet we discovered 2 out of the 3 hinges were ripped out of the cheap wood that looks like compressed cardboard.I emailed the company and had to go back and forth with them. Send pic's etc..They said they would contact their insurance company and get back to me.It's been 30 days and nothing, not a word.The cabinet is very large and heavy.In time something tells me the hinges would rip out anyway from normal use of opening and closing the door. <end>  Makes my wife very happy  My wife had quite a few different storage/display set-ups for jewelery and wanted to consolidate. This cabinet did the trick. Although it was clearly stated that it is not intended to be flush mounted, I expected to recess it between studs. Although I think it could have been done, my wife convinced me to try just mounting it on the wall first. So we did and it really doesn't interfere with walking by, so it stayed wall-mounted. Didn't use the supplied mounting screws with drywall inserts - don't think they would hold very well. Was able to get several long screws into studs and it is pretty solid. I do a good bit of woodworking and could have made a cabinet for this, but for the price it seemed a good idea. I would have had to make the time but my wife was anxious. It is decently made and has lots of storage hooks, etc. inside. <end>  Heavy  This unit is very heavy. Two people are required for installation. Plus, the installation with three anchors placed in inconvenient locations is not practical and does not add any strength to hold it on the wall. I would never have purchased this if I had known how difficult it is to install. I would purchase the lighter ones that give you the flexibility of hanging over the door as well as the wall. <end>  Love it  I love love love this mirror! Great quality and looks so nice on the wall. Best of all it holds all my jewelry and keeps it well organized. It is very heavy so we took the advice of some of the previous reviews and used additional anchors when hanging so there is no chance of it falling off the wall. I can't believe how great it looks. <end>  Best purchase ever! You have to get one if you love jewelry.  -)  I purchased this item because I LOVE jewelry and have so many pieces that I want to protect from tarnishing and keep detangled. I couldnt have been happier when I finished filling it up - I could see everything (I added a customer image of it full, check it out)! I look forward to filling this up even more. Also, being able to see everything at once helps you get creative with new combinations. This is a perfect gift! A note on hanging hardware  I am not sure if what is sent with item works because we didnt use it. We opted for extra reassurance and got mollies with a lot of bite. This is not to say the hardware wouldnt work, but since it was my jewelry being wall mounted we took extra precautions to really make sure it would stay mounted to the wall. Highly recommend this product!!!! <end>  An Xmas home run  Ordered for my wife for Xmas. The cabinet is very solid and seems to have every hook, slot and cubby imaginable. Took a bit to wall mount (plaster walls) but this was a great purchase. <end>  As expected  Not as nice as the cherry finish one that we have, but perfect for my daughter's white furniture bedroom.   ) <end>  Excellent product and worth every penny!!!  Excellent jewelry wall box. It is extremely solid and I love that it locks. This item will last for decades. <end>
 B000RAOAFE  Sterling Silver Plain Cross Pendant ||	  A little disappointed  It is shorter and thinner than I had hoped. The 2 inch measurement includes the necklace loop. The quality of the cross and the silver seem fine, but the size is not what I thought it might be. I bought this as a gift for someone else to wear on the outside of their shirt, but it is way too small and thin for that. It would be fine worn inside next to body, but too small for outer wear. <end>  Excellent Quality  This pendant is exactly what I was looking for. I bought it last summer and I'm still wearing it now. Great quality for the price; it's basic, and durable. Be sure to buy a chain for it though. It's just a pendant, not a full necklace. (Chains are not expensive at all) <end>
 B000RCXI00  Copper Clad Magnetic Link 0.50" Wide Bracelet 8.5" Long with Fold over Clasps ||	  a good deal  Recieved this item last week and have been wearing it ever since. It is quality made, the clasp is secure and has a pleasant appearance. The seller shipped the item quickly (USPS just sat on it instead of doing their job so actual delivery was a little slow, not the seller's fault).I am very happy with my purchase. <end>  Too bad quality  good look but bad quality, it remain a stains on the skin. it look nice but its not worth it, <end>  Clasp inferior  The bracelet is very nice, but apparently the clasp was defective on it. I only had it four days before it just disappeared. I never even noticed when it came off. I certainly didn't take it off. I guess it may have come off when I was playing golf. Just don't know. Wish I had it back.Fred Sutterlin <end>
 B000TA3KD0  4mm Rhodium Plated Tennis Bracelet 7 Inch ||	  PLENTY OF SPARKLE!  This is a beautiful cz bracelet with lots of sparkle! It catches the sunshine and the light. It is versatile and looks good with casual clothes or for getting dressed-up. It is well made, comfortable and it has a sturdy clasp. It is easy to put on and take off without assistance.

 B000U1W9B2  Juicy Couture Gold Starter Charm Bracelet ||	  Beautiful bracelet  This is one of the pretties pieces of costume jewelery I've seen in a while. I also bought a charm that is spectacular. Definitely recommend. <end>  Really likey!  This is the first time I receive a product (jewelry) which looks exactly like the picture. It arrived quickly, nicely packaged and it looks great on my wrist! <end>  Great gift  Shipped quickly and the product was what I was looking for! Great gift for 14-year old! <end>  Just what the princess ordered  This item was shipped very quickly and was exactly what our princess wanted at a much lower price than local stores. <end>  Juicy Gold Charm bracelet  Great product, great packaging. Shipped when stated in ad, good email communication for tracking. Very please with product & vendor. Would definitely order again. <end>  Pretty but too big for me  I like the bracelet, but it's too wide for me and keeps coming undone. Plus the heart is so heavy it kept banging on everything and was inconvenient...in the end I took it off and wear it as a pendant. So generally nice, but probably better suited for someone else. <end>  Very nice  I purchased this bracelet from Bloomingdales for my 14 year old and it looks very elegant. I also purchased one charm and will give her more charms on special occasions and holidays. She is also looking forward to saving up to purchase a charm for herself. <end>  Sad  Very disappointed it took 4 days to receive my email that the item is out of stock. I would not recommend this dealer. The item should never have been listed for sale and/or I should have been notified in less than 24 hours if it was unavailable. <end>  Not for long wear  I own both the starter bracelet and necklace that I bought at the Juicy Couture store. Since it is only gold plated the gold color strips and chips away with normal wear leaving your bracelet looking cheap as it reveals the brass underneath. If you get anything with rinestones, the rinestones may fall out(mostly on the charms). I do like them, and everywhere I go people always compliment me on them, even if they don't know about Juicy. I would say, they are cute and you can buy them, but don't expect them too last too long. The very best Juicy Couture jewelry to buy is the sterling silver but the prices are significantly higher. For a charm that in gold plating costs 40, the same one in sterling silver can be 150! My sister just received a sterling necklace that costs about 300! So spending about 30 to 60 on the starter gold plated necklace and bracelet and charms, is not too bad(although the charms are more expensive, but the bracelet and necklace look really nice without them). The best things to buy at Juicy are the tracksuits, purses, and t-shirts. Be careful with jewelry and even some of their shoes. So in closing, I love everything at Juicy, you feel like a princess when you wear anything from there, just don't expect their lower end jewelry to last in the same state you bought it in for very long. Definitely don't wear in the shower, pool, things like that to extend the life of it. And if you can afford the sterling silver, (as they don't have solid gold) jewelry, then that would be your best bet. Hope this helps! ) <end>  gold wears off VERY quickly  Bought this bracelet as a xmas gift for my daughter. The gold tone was visibly wearing within the first 2 days she owned the product. She did not shower or sleep with the bracelet. After one week the bracelet looked horrible and my daughter no longer wears it. No response from seller. <end>  Love it  I love this bracelet. My lovely husband gave it to me, just because. It's pretty heavy, which I like and shines well. I don't wear it every day as I want it to last longer without too many scratches. Just wish JC stuff were not as pricey. <end>  Cute, but you get what you pay for  It is really cute, a little on the small (and heavy!) side. After a day of normal wear, i did notice the silver tones underneath. I would not wear this as your every day jewelry. As an above review said, I would save up for the silver stuff. Maybe its supposed to look antiqued, who knows... <end>  Heavy, but very pretty  I read the reviews and hope it doesn't chip up! I'll be careful with it. This looks good even without charms on it, though; very pretty. The charms are heavy, so you won't want many on there are once. I have five, but usually only use one or two at a time.It's very chunky, so only Juicy charms fit on it. Sad, because it could be like a modern Pandora bracelet if you could fit other types of charms, like plant rhinestones, between the Juicy charms. Maybe Juicy should make some &#34;plain&#34; (not heavy) rhinestones to hang between the heavier charms? <end>  nice weight cheap finish  Don't pay for this. Looks good for the first wear and then changes. I even stored mine in the box in my vault with my really expensive jewellery. Sorry I did because it started to strip after only one wear  -(...total waste of my $138 <end>  EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY  I've never been so disappointed with a purchase before, especially given the relatively high price tag and LOW quality. I've bought $10 bracelets from Target that have lasted longer and held up better. Juicy Couture jewelry is terrible.I bought the gold starter bracelet because I wanted to wear a specific charm (the corgi one). After ONE wear, the gold color rubbed off from both the bracelet and part of the charm. Any part of the bracelet and charm that came into contact with my skin lost color and became a dull silver. I contacted the seller and was told "it's not real gold" (well DUH!!) and that there was nothing they could do about it. Because I was starting to wonder if this was a genuine Juicy Couture item, I brought it to a store and they basically said the same thing and added that it probably came off because I was wearing lotion..?? What girl doesn't wear moisturizer? Nice of them to blame the customer for their crappy quality. (Terrible customer service at the store, btw.)The good - Looks cute....The bad - Color came off after ONE wearing.- Expensive for the quality.- EXTREMELY poor quality.This was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. I should have spent the money on real gold or silver jewelry. Lesson learned. Never buy their overpriced, poor quality "jewelry" again. <end>  Poor Quality  first picture does not match the second. the second is taken from the actual website. visibly poor quality, yet costs as much as the real thing. might as well purchase from Juicy online. <end>  Good experience  Beautiful charm bracelet, a bit heavier than I expected, but I love it. Shipped very quickly and came in a cute gift box. Great buy! <end>  It's Cute  I had just ordered the bracelet two days before and I just received it yesterday! I thought I was going to receive it until the 22. Anyway, I recently had the original juicy bracelet but somehow my sister lost it -__-. It's nothing compared to the original one. this one feels much lighter of course because it's cheap gold but It's decent enough to wear. I actually really like it and it came in its cute box also. Ill try not to wear it too much as ive seen in previous reviews that the color wears off. <end>
