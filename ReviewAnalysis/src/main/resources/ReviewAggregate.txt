I isn't bought this necklace on a whim; I love butterflies and it looked so dainty and sweet. It was actually a little more weighty than I expected, although it's not a solid piece. The chain is shiny and nicer than I expected.Bought via gold box ,it is much better than I thought!the chain is also great!I love this necklace. It is great for everyday wear and is very durable and cute. I have small children and they love it.Love this butterfly pendant. Right size, high quality and elegant design. Plus, it is really easy to wear and remove all by myself, no help needed.<end>
